              "abstract": "Until recently, there has been no standard treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed an anthracycline-containing regimen, and no definitive phase III trials had been conducted in this setting. The results of three randomized phase III clinical trials of single-agent docetaxel (Taxotere, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA) 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in comparison to combination chemotherapy regimens in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen are reviewed and reported. An overall response rate of between 30% and 42% was reported for single-agent docetaxel, which was higher in comparison to response rates attained with the combination chemotherapy regimens in all three trials. Noteworthy were findings of a significantly improved overall survival for docetaxel-treated patients in one of the comparative trials. These results firmly establish docetaxel as preferred therapy over combination chemotherapy regimens with mitomycin C plus vinblastine, methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil, or 5-fluorouracil plus vinorelbine in the therapy of anthracycline-resistant and/or anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients. The results document the continued high level of docetaxel antitumor activity in previously anthracycline-exposed patients initially reported in phase II trials and confirm a substantial lack of anthracycline cross-resistance. The higher response rate of single-agent docetaxel versus single-agent doxorubicin as demonstrated in a fourth randomized phase III trial gives credence to the presumption that the combination of these two agents may provide a highly effective chemotherapy regimen in the management of breast cancer patients.\n",

              "abstract": "Two new drugs from two new chemotherapy compound families were developed concomitantly: Taxoter (docetaxel), a taxane derivate and CPT 11 (irinotecan) a topoisomerase inhibitor. Six phase I trials of Taxoter were performed. The limiting toxicity is neutropenia. The recommended dosage for phase II trial is 100 mg/m2 administered in 1 hour perfusion, every 21 days. Neutropenic fever is unfrequent. Other toxicities are mucositis, skin toxicity, hypersensibility reaction, weight gain and oedema. None of these toxicities were limiting. Six phase I studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CPT 11 (irinotecan). Two different schedules were studied: the weekly 30-90 minutes infusion and an infusion administered every three weeks in one day or daily over three or five consecutive days. The limiting toxicity of the weekly schedule is diarrhea. Therefore the recommended dosage is 100-150 mg/m2/week. While dose limiting toxicities in the three week schedule are diarrhea as well as neutropenia. The recommended dose is 350 mg/m2. Since diarrhea appeared to be the major problem in achieving high dose intensity with CPT 11, a dose escalation trial with drug support against diarrhea was performed. A recommended dosage of 500 mg/m2 is therefore described. These two drugs are under evaluation in a large spectrum of tumors. Their original mechanism of action suggests interesting therapeutic properties. Clinical studies in combination with other drugs are in progress to define the role of topoisomerase I inhibitors and taxane in cancer therapy.\n",

In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.\nCopyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

There may be a potential role in selective screening in men at elevated risk for breast cancer, but the effectiveness of such screening remains unexplored. Purpose To evaluate patterns of male breast imaging utilization, to determine high-risk screening outcomes, and to delineate risk factors associated with cancer diagnosis. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed consecutive male breast imaging examinations over a 12-year period (between 2005-2017). Examination indications, biopsy recommendations, and pathologic results were correlated with patient characteristics. Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 1869 men (median age, 55 years; range, 18-96 years) underwent 2052 examinations yielding 2304 breast lesions and resulting in 149 (6.5%) biopsies in 133 men; 41 (27.5%) were malignant and 108 (72.5%) were benign. There were 1781 (86.8%) diagnostic and 271 (13.2%) screening examinations. All men undergoing screening had personal or family history of breast cancer and/or genetic mutations.

Patients evaluated between 1/1/2007 and 3/1/2011 under diagnosis codes for family history of breast or ovarian cancer, genetic syndromes, lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia were included. Patients with a history of breast cancer were excluded. Retrospective review of prospectively acquired demographics, lifetime risk of breast cancer, and screening recommendations were obtained from the medical record. Retrospective review of the results of prospectively interpreted breast imaging examinations and image-guided biopsies were analyzed. 282 women were included. The majority of patients were premenopausal with a median age of 43. Most (69%) were referred due to a family history of breast or ovarian cancers. MRI was recommended for 84% of patients based on a documented lifetime risk >20%. Most women referred for MRI screening (88%) were compliant with this recommendation. A total of 299 breast MRI examinations were performed in 146 patients. Biopsy was performed for 32 (11%) exams and 10 cancers were detected for a positive predictive value (PPV) of 31% (based on biopsy performed) and an overall per exam cancer yield of 3.3%. Three cancers were detected in patients who did not undergo screening MRI. The 13 cancers were Stage 0-II; all patients were without evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 22 months. In a cohort of women seen by breast subspecialty providers, screening breast MRI was recommended according to guidelines, and used primarily in premenopausal women with a family history or genetic predisposition to breast cancer. Adherence to MRI screening recommendations was high and cancer yield from breast MRI was similar to that in clinical trials.\n© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

Preclinical models support the use of platinum agents in the TNBC basal subtype. The EA1131 trial hypothesized that invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) would not be inferior but improved in patients with basal subtype TNBC treated with adjuvant platinum compared with capecitabine.\nPatients with clinical stage II or III TNBC with ≥ 1 cm RD in the breast post-NAC were randomly assigned to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles or capecitabine 14 out of 21 days every 3 weeks for six cycles. TNBC subtype (basal  nonbasal) was determined by PAM50 in the residual disease. A noninferiority design with superiority alternative was chosen, assuming a 4-year iDFS of 67% with capecitabine.\nFour hundred ten of planned 775 participants were randomly assigned to platinum or capecitabine between 2015 and 2021. After median follow-up of 20 months and 120 iDFS events (61% of full information) in the 308 (78%) patients with basal subtype TNBC, the 3-year iDFS for platinum was 42% (95% CI, 30 to 53) versus 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) for capecitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were more common with platinum agents. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial as it was unlikely that further follow-up would show noninferiority or superiority of platinum.\nPlatinum agents do not improve outcomes in patients with basal subtype TNBC RD post-NAC and are associated with more severe toxicity when compared with capecitabine. Participants had a lower than expected 3-year iDFS regardless of study treatment, highlighting the need for better therapies in this high-risk population.\n",

Creating these combinations is sometimes empirically motivated by non-overlapping toxicities or the expectation of non-cross resistance. Yet, there is usually no absolute division of these aspects among cytotoxic agents, and the median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer has not been dramatically prolonged by this approach. When the outcome of treatment is palliation rather than cure, it becomes paramount to optimize the dynamic equilibrium between chemotherapy-induced side effects and the benefits attributable to relief of cancer-related symptoms. To this end, several recent clinical trials have evaluated the novel nucleoside analog gemcitabine (Gemzar) as single-agent therapy for advanced breast cancer. This article reviews these trials.\n",

Various therapies, such as hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic therapies, can increase cure rates in the early-stage setting and improve survival and quality of life in specific advanced-disease settings.

Gemcitabine is a newer agent with a unique mode of action that involves DNA chain termination and mechanisms that result in self-potentiation. This results in a broad spectrum of activity in many types of solid tumors including breast cancer. As a single agent, gemcitabine yields response rates ranging from 14%-37% as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer and 23%-42% as salvage therapy. However, these were small studies with large confidence intervals around all the indices of benefit including response rate, response duration, and time to disease progression. Gemcitabine was associated with higher response rates when used in combination with other agents. The side-effect profile of gemcitabine has been favorable compared to that of commonly used cytotoxic drugs, and includes myelosuppression and fatigue, with a notable absence of alopecia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Larger ongoing studies will help define the utility of gemcitabine in advanced breast cancer\n",
