        "Background/Purpose": "Long-term randomized data assessing the effect of ablative therapies in patients with oligometastases are lacking. The Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastases (SABR-COMET) randomized phase 2 trial was originally designed with 5 years of follow-up, but the trial was amended in 2016 to extend follow-up to 10 years. Herein we report oncologic outcomes beyond 5 years.",
        "Methods": "Patients were eligible if they had a controlled primary tumor and 1 to 5 metastases, with all metastases amenable to SABR. Patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard-of-care treatment (control arm) versus SABR to all metastases plus standard of care (SABR arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General [FACT-G]), and time to new metastases.",
        "Results/Findings": "Ninety-nine patients were randomized between 2012 and 2016 (n = 33 in arm 1 vs n = 66 in arm 2). Primary tumor sites included lung (n = 18), breast (n = 18), colon (n = 18), prostate (n = 16), and other (n = 29). Eight-year OS was 27.2% in the SABR arm versus 13.6% in the control arm (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.84; P = .008). Eight-year PFS estimates were 21.3% versus 0.0%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.72; P < .001). Rates of grade ≥ 2 acute or late toxic effects were 30.3% versus 9.1% (P = .019), with no new grade 3 to 5 toxic effects. FACT-G quality of life scores declined over time in both arms, but there were no differences in quality of life scores between arms. The use of systemic therapy overall was similar between arms, but patients in the SABR arm were less likely to require cytotoxic chemotherapy (33.3% vs 54.6%, respectively, P = .043).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SABR achieved durable improvements in OS and PFS, with no new major toxicity signals with extended follow-up. A minority of patients randomized to the SABR arm (21.3%) achieved > 5 years of survival without recurrence.",

        "es_title": "Integrative oncology: Addressing the global challenges of cancer prevention and treatment.",
        "Background/Purpose": "The increase in cancer incidence and mortality is challenging current cancer care delivery globally, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) when it comes to receiving evidence-based cancer prevention, treatment, and palliative and survivorship care. Patients in LMICs often rely on traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) that is more familiar, less costly, and widely available. However, spheres of influence and tensions between conventional medicine and TCIM can further disrupt efforts in evidence-based cancer care. Integrative oncology provides a framework to research and integrate safe, effective TCIM alongside conventional cancer treatment and can help bridge health care gaps in delivering evidence-informed, patient-centered care. This growing field uses lifestyle modifications, mind and body therapies (eg, acupuncture, massage, meditation, and yoga), and natural products to improve symptom management and quality of life among patients with cancer. On the basis of this review of the global challenges of cancer control and the current status of integrative oncology, the authors recommend: 1) educating and integrating TCIM providers into the cancer control workforce to promote risk reduction and culturally salient healthy life styles; 2) developing and testing TCIM interventions to address cancer symptoms or treatment-related adverse effects (eg, pain, insomnia, fatigue); and 3) disseminating and implementing evidence-based TCIM interventions as part of comprehensive palliative and survivorship care so patients from all cultures can live with or beyond cancer with respect, dignity, and vitality. With conventional medicine and TCIM united under a cohesive framework, integrative oncology may provide citizens of the world with access to safe, effective, evidence-informed, and culturally sensitive cancer care.",

        "Background/Purpose": "More evidence shows that primary surgery for de novo metastatic breast cancer (BC) prolongs overall survival (OS) in selected cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of locoregional treatment (LRT) in BC patients with de novo stage IV bone only metastasis (BOM).",
        "Methods": "The prospective, multicenter registry study BOMET MF14-01 was initiated in May 2014. Patients with de novo stage IV BOM BC were divided into two groups: those receiving systemic treatment (ST group) and those receiving LRT (LRT group). Patients who received LRT were further divided into two groups: ST after LRT (LRT + ST group) and ST before LRT (ST + LRT group).",
        "Results/Findings": "We included 505 patients in this study; 240 (47.5%) patients in the ST group and 265 (52.5%) in the LRT group. One hundred and thirteen patients (26.3%) died in the 34-month median follow-up, 85 (35.4%) in the ST group and 28 (10.5%) in LRT group. Local progression was observed in 39 (16.2%) of the patients in the ST group and 18 (6.7%) in the LRT group (p = 0.001). Hazard of death was 60% lower in the LRT group compared with the ST group (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30-0.54, p < 0.0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this prospectively maintained registry study, we found that LRT prolonged survival and decreased locoregional recurrence in the median 3-year follow-up. Timing of primary breast surgery either at diagnosis or after ST provided a survival benefit similar to ST alone in de novo stage IV BOM BC patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The phase III MONALEESA-3 trial included first- (1L) and second-line (2L) patients and demonstrated a significant overall survival (OS) benefit for ribociclib + fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in the final protocol-specified and exploratory (longer follow-up) OS analyses. At the time of these analyses, the full OS benefit of 1L ribociclib was not completely characterized because the median OS (mOS) was not reached. As CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) + endocrine therapy (ET) is now a preferred option for 1L HR+/HER2- ABC, we report an exploratory analysis (median follow-up, 70.8 months; 14.5 months longer than the prior analysis) to fully elucidate the OS benefit in the MONALEESA-3 1L population.",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- ABC were randomized 2:1 to 1L/2L fulvestrant + ribociclib or placebo. OS in 1L patients (de novo disease or relapse > 12 months from completion of [neo]adjuvant ET) was assessed by Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier methods. Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) were analyzed. MONALEESA-3 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ).",
        "Results/Findings": "At data cutoff (January 12, 2022; median follow-up time, 70.8 months), mOS was 67.6 versus 51.8 months with 1L ribociclib versus placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67; 95% CI 0.50-0.90); 16.5% and 8.6% of ribociclib and placebo patients, respectively, were still receiving treatment. PFS2 (HR 0.64) and CFS (HR 0.62) favored ribociclib versus placebo. Among those who discontinued treatment, 16.7% and 35.0% on ribociclib or placebo, respectively, received a subsequent CDK4/6i. No new safety signals were observed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This analysis of MONALEESA-3 reports the longest mOS thus far (67.6 months) for 1L patients in a phase III ABC trial. These results in a 1L population show that the OS benefit of ribociclib was maintained through extended follow-up, further supporting its use in HR+/HER2- ABC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "On the basis of the results from CLEOPATRA, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy is the first-line standard of care for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, discrepancies have been reported between clinical trial and real-world outcomes. We report real-world outcomes for patients with HER2-positive MBC treated with first-line pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and a taxane in routine clinical practice in the United States.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective analysis was conducted using electronic health record-derived deidentified data from the Flatiron Health database. Patients were grouped according to the first taxane received (paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel or docetaxel). Median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Subgroup analyses were conducted in patients treated with docetaxel who met CLEOPATRA's key eligibility criteria.",
        "Results/Findings": "We included 1,065 patients; 313 patients received paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel and 752 received docetaxel. Patients who received paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel were older, had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, and had more recurrent metastatic disease compared with the docetaxel group. After adjustment for potential confounders, similar median rwPFS (inverse probability of treatment weighted average treatment effect for the treated [IPTW-ATT] hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3;   = .365) and rwOS (IPTW-ATT HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.58;   = .101) was observed between treatment groups. In the subgroup of CLEOPATRA-eligible patients, median rwPFS and rwOS were 16.9 months and 57.8 months, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "There was no statistically significant difference in real-world outcomes between patients treated with paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel and those treated with docetaxel. Selecting patients using key CLEOPATRA eligibility criteria resulted in rwPFS and rwOS similar to those observed in CLEOPATRA, highlighting the importance of ensuring similar patient populations when comparing clinical trial and real-world data.",

        "es_title": "Multidisciplinary management of advanced primary and metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Background/Purpose": "Combined modality therapy has become the treatment of choice for patients with primary breast cancer, including those with locally advanced breast cancer. Primary or induction chemotherapy, followed by surgery or radiation therapy or both, and adjuvant systemic therapy is a generally accepted strategy. Most tumors respond with a more than 50% decrease in tumor size, and approximately 70% of patients experience down-staging through primary chemotherapy. Breast conservation is possible for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and almost all patients initially are rendered disease free. Primary chemotherapy should be the initial choice of treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors, but it is unclear what the optimal sequence of subsequent therapies should be, or whether one or two local treatment modalities are necessary. The most dramatic example of the efficacy of these regimens was demonstrated in patients with inflammatory breast cancer. Previously a universally fatal condition, the natural history of this disease has been changed dramatically by the introduction of these combined modality therapies. Five-year survival rates of 35-60% commonly are reported, and it is likely that about one third of patients with this highly aggressive form of disease will survive beyond 10 years without recurrence. Combined modality therapy that includes primary chemotherapy provides appropriate local control, the possibility of breast conservation therapy, and, probably, an increased survival rate, at least for some subsets of patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The use of similar treatment strategies for early breast cancer is currently under evaluation. Hormone therapy and combination chemotherapy represent the main treatment approaches to metastatic breast cancer. Radiotherapy is also a useful palliative tool, especially for control of painful bone metastases and central nervous system involvement. Patient and tumor characteristics help in the optimal selection of systemic therapy. Palliative therapy for symptomatic control and prolongation of life also preserves a good quality of life. Dose-intensive chemotherapy is being evaluated as a treatment to increase complete response rates and cause remission consolidation. Clinical trials on several new and effective cytotoxic agents, as well as new hormonal compounds, are being completed and are showing encouraging preliminary results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Multilevel procedures were used to compare the intervention groups with the control group over time.",
        "Results/Findings": "Compared with the control group, the intervention groups had a significant decrease in levels of endocrine symptoms (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms; P<.001; effect size, 0.31-0.52) and urinary symptoms (Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire; P=.002; effect size, 0.29-0.33), and they showed an improvement in physical functioning (36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning subscale; P=.002; effect size, 0.37-0.46). The groups that included CBT also showed a significant decrease in the perceived burden of hot flashes and night sweats (problem rating scale of the Hot Flush Rating Scale; P<.001; effect size, 0.39-0.56) and an increase in sexual activity (Sexual Activity Questionnaire habit subscale; P=.027; effect size, 0.65). Most of these effects were observed at both the 12-week and 6-month follow-ups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "CBT and PE can have salutary effects on endocrine symptoms and, to a lesser degree, on sexuality and physical functioning of patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause.

        "Background/Purpose": "Toxicity due to treatment causes a negative impact on quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Hot flash symptoms, described as intense sensations of heat, sweating and flushing occur in more than 50 % of breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen. We hypothesized that venlafaxine, a selective-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor drug, was effective for reducing patient-reported hot flash scores among women treated for breast cancer compared to other non-hormonal treatments. We searched Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception till May 2015 for venlafaxine (75 mg once daily or greater) with non-hormonal comparators for the treatment of hot flashes in female breast cancer patients. The primary outcome was hot flash score (derived from patient-reported hot flash severity and frequency) in randomized controlled trials. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each study due to variation in the outcome measures. Heterogeneity was determined using I (2) statistics, and publication bias was assessed using a contour funnel plot and Egger's tests. Pooled analyses demonstrated that venlafaxine significantly reduced hot flash scores compared to the trial comparators (overall SMD 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.40, 3.72]). There was significant heterogeneity among these studies (I (2) = 98.7%, P < 0.001). Asymmetry in the contour funnel plot suggests the presence of publication bias and a trend towards small study effects (Egger's test, P = 0.096). Venlafaxine is efficacious in managing hot flashes among women with breast cancer. This review highlights methodological issues that arise from eligible trials and recommends a collaborative approach in survivorship studies.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Patient-centered decision making about hot flash treatments often incorporates a balance of efficacy and side effects in addition to patient preference. This systematic review examines randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing at least two non-hormonal hot flash treatments in breast cancer survivors. In July 2015, PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched for RCTs comparing active, non-hormonal hot flash treatments in female breast cancer survivors. Thirteen trials were included after identifying 906 potential studies. Four trials were dose comparison studies of pharmacologic treatments citalopram, venlafaxine, gabapentin, and paroxetine. Hot flash reduction did not differ by tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor use. Citalopram 10, 20, and 30 mg daily had comparable outcomes. Venlafaxine 75 mg daily improved hot flashes without additional side effects from higher dosing. Gabapentin 900 mg daily improved hot flashes more than 300 mg. Paroxetine 10 mg daily had fewer side effects than 20 mg. Among four trials comparing different pharmacologic treatments, venlafaxine alleviated hot flash symptoms faster than clonidine; participants preferred venlafaxine over gabapentin. Five trials compared pharmacologic to non-pharmacologic treatments. Acupuncture had similar efficacy to venlafaxine and gabapentin but may have longer durability after completing treatment and fewer side effects. We could not perform a pooled meta-analysis because outcomes were not reported in comparable formats. Clinical trial data on non-hormonal hot flash treatments provide comparisons of hot flash efficacy and other patient important outcomes to guide clinical management. Clinicians can use the information to help patients select hot flash interventions.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem. While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear. Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT. The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.",
        "Methods": "The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm. Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190). The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence. However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up. A long term follow-up has now been performed.",
        "Results/Findings": "After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9). Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls. There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013). No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports. The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure. As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions. Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT. Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors. Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 predispose individuals to breast cancer (termed germline-mutated BRCA1/2 breast cancer, gBRCA-BC) by impairing homologous recombination (HR) and causing genomic instability. HR also repairs DNA lesions caused by platinum agents and PARP inhibitors. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) harbor subpopulations with BRCA1/2 mutations, hypothesized to be especially platinum-sensitive. Cancers in putative 'BRCAness' subgroups-tumors with BRCA1 methylation; low levels of BRCA1 mRNA (BRCA1 mRNA-low); or mutational signatures for HR deficiency and those with basal phenotypes-may also be sensitive to platinum. We assessed the efficacy of carboplatin and another mechanistically distinct therapy, docetaxel, in a phase 3 trial in subjects with unselected advanced TNBC. A prespecified protocol enabled biomarker-treatment interaction analyses in gBRCA-BC and BRCAness subgroups. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). In the unselected population (376 subjects; 188 carboplatin, 188 docetaxel), carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR, 31.4% versus 34.0%, respectively; P = 0.66). In contrast, in subjects with gBRCA-BC, carboplatin had double the ORR of docetaxel (68% versus 33%, respectively; biomarker, treatment interaction P = 0.01). Such benefit was not observed for subjects with BRCA1 methylation, BRCA1 mRNA-low tumors or a high score in a Myriad HRD assay. Significant interaction between treatment and the basal-like subtype was driven by high docetaxel response in the nonbasal subgroup. We conclude that patients with advanced TNBC benefit from characterization of BRCA1/2 mutations, but not BRCA1 methylation or Myriad HRD analyses, to inform choices on platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, gene expression analysis of basal-like cancers may also influence treatment selection.",

Other options include systemic therapy, best supportive care, enrollment onto a clinical trial, and/or palliative care. There are insufficient data to recommend for or against performing routine magnetic resonance imaging to screen for brain metastases; clinicians should have a low threshold for magnetic resonance imaging of the brain because of the high incidence of brain metastases among patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Bone metastases are common in patients with advanced breast cancer. Given the significant associated morbidity, the introduction of new, effective systemic therapies, and the improvement in survival time, early detection and response assessment of skeletal metastases have become even more important. Although planar bone scanning has recognized limitations, in particular, poor specificity in staging and response assessment, it continues to be the main method in current clinical practice for staging of the skeleton in patients at risk of bone metastases. However, the accuracy of bone scanning can be improved with the addition of SPECT/CT. There have been reported improvements in sensitivity and specificity for staging of the skeleton with either bone-specific PET/CT tracers, such as (18)F-NaF, or tumor-specific tracers, such as (18)F-FDG, although these methods are less widely available and more costly. There is a paucity of data on the use of (18)F-NaF PET/CT for response assessment in breast cancer, but there is increasing evidence that (18)F-FDG PET/CT may improve on current methods in this regard. At the same time, interest and experience in using whole-body morphologic MRI augmented with diffusion-weighted imaging for both staging and response assessment in the skeleton have been increasing. However, data on comparisons of these methods with PET methods to determine the best technique for current clinical practice or for clinical trials are insufficient. There are early data supporting the use (18)F-FDG PET/MRI to assess malignant disease in the skeleton, with the possibility of taking advantage of the synergies offered by combining morphologic, physiologic, and metabolic imaging.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Osteonecrosis of the jaws is a recently described adverse side effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton who are receiving intravenous, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws; these patients represent 94% of published cases. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. Oversuppression of bone turnover is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this condition, although there may be contributing comorbid factors. All sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. Conservative débridement of necrotic bone, pain control, infection management, use of antimicrobial oral rinses, and withdrawal of bisphosphonates are preferable to aggressive surgical measures for treating this condition. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose Skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or the necessity for radiation or surgery to bone metastasis cause considerable morbidity, decrements in quality of life, and costs to the health care system. The results of a recent large randomized trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology [CALGB/Alliance 70604]) showed that zoledronic acid (ZA) every 3 months was noninferior to monthly ZA in reducing the risks of SREs. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) of monthly ZA, ZA every 3 months, and monthly denosumab in women with breast cancer and skeletal metastases. Methods Using a Markov model, costs per SRE avoided were calculated for the three treatments. Sensitivity analyses were performed where denosumab SRE probabilities were assumed to be 50%, 75%, and 90% lower than the ZA SRE probabilities. Quality-adjusted life-years were also calculated. The analysis was from the US payer perspective. Results The mean costs of the denosumab treatment strategy are nine-fold higher than generic ZA every 3 months. Quality-adjusted life-years were virtually identical in all the three treatment arms; hence, the optimal treatment would be ZA every 3 months because it was the least costly treatment. The sensitivity analyses showed that relative to ZA every 3 months, the incremental costs per mean SRE avoided for denosumab ranged from $162,918 to $347,655. Conclusion ZA every 3 months was more CE in reducing the risks of SRE than monthly denosumab. This analysis was one of the first to incorporate the costs of generic ZA and one of the first independent CE analyses not sponsored by either Novartis or Amgen, the makers of ZA and denosumab, respectively. ZA every 3 months is the more CE option and more reasonable alternative to monthly denosumab.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Symptoms of urogenital atrophy are common in breast cancer survivors. Its optimal management is currently unknown. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating treatments for urogenital atrophy in breast cancer patients was performed. EMBASE, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1946 to November 2014. Outcomes included improvements in both vaginal symptoms (e.g., dryness, pain, dyspareunia and itching) and vaginal hormone response measured by validated scales [e.g., Vaginal Health Index (VHI) and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI)]. Of 430 unique citations identified, 4 studies (n = 196) met inclusion criteria. Interventions included pH-balanced gel, Replens(®), lidocaine, Estring(®) and Vagifem(®). Sample sizes ranged from 7 to 98 patients. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis of results was performed. One study of 98 patients suggested that vaginal pH-balanced gel (mean VHI 5.00 ± 0.816, mean VMI 51.18 ± 3.753) was more efficient than placebo (VHI 16.98 ± 3.875, p < 0.001, VMI 47.87 ± 2.728, p < 0.001) at 12 weeks in providing vaginal symptom relief. In patients who used lidocaine, 90 % had reduced dyspareunia compared to saline in a study of 46 patients. Although increased serum estradiol occurred, both Estring(®) and Vagifem(®) were shown to improve quality of life and VMI in a study of seven patients. Treatment of urogenital atrophy remains a challenging issue and there is a paucity of RCT evidence addressing this knowledge gap. It is evident that more prospective trials are needed.",

In the statistical testing hierarchy, ORR and patient-reported outcomes were tested sequentially if overall survival was significant. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "At the data cutoff date of July 1, 2022, 543 of 776 screened patients were randomly assigned between May 30, 2019, and April 5, 2021, with 272 patients in the sacituzumab govitecan group and 271 patients in the chemotherapy group. With a 12·5-month (IQR 6·4-18·8) median follow-up, 390 deaths occurred among 543 patients.

        "Methods": "This randomized phase III trial enrolled patients with gBRCA1/2-mutated HER2-negative ABC. Patients received talazoparib or physician's choice of chemotherapy. OS was analyzed using stratified HR and log-rank test and prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for subsequent treatments.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 431 patients were entered in a randomized study (287 talazoparib/144 chemotherapy) with 412 patients treated (286 talazoparib/126 chemotherapy). By 30 September 2019, 216 deaths (75.3%) occurred for talazoparib and 108 (75.0%) chemotherapy; median follow-up was 44.9 and 36.8 months, respectively. HR for OS with talazoparib versus chemotherapy was 0.848 (95% CI 0.670-1.073; P = 0.17); median (95% CI) 19.3 months (16.6-22.5 months) versus 19.5 months (17.4-22.4 months). Kaplan-Meier survival percentages (95% CI) for talazoparib versus chemotherapy: month 12, 71% (66% to 76%)/74% (66% to 81%); month 24, 42% (36% to 47%)/38% (30% to 47%); month 36, 27% (22% to 33%)/21% (14% to 29%). Most patients received subsequent treatments: for talazoparib and chemotherapy, 46.3%/41.7% received platinum and 4.5%/32.6% received a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, respectively. Adjusting for subsequent PARP and/or platinum use, HR for OS was 0.756 (95% bootstrap CI 0.503-1.029). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 69.6% (talazoparib) and 64.3% (chemotherapy) patients, consistent with previous reports.

Here, we report results for the secondary end point overall survival (OS). Postmenopausal women (N = 666) with ER+/HER2- ABC without previous systemic therapy for ABC were randomly assigned 2:1 to palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole.

        "Background/Purpose": "Most patients with metastatic cancer eventually develop resistance to systemic therapy, with some having limited disease progression (ie, oligoprogression). We aimed to assess whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) targeting oligoprogressive sites could improve patient outcomes.",
        "Methods": "We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised controlled trial of SBRT in patients with oligoprogressive metastatic breast cancer or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after having received at least first-line systemic therapy, with oligoprogression defined as five or less progressive lesions on PET-CT or CT. Patients aged 18 years or older were enrolled from a tertiary cancer centre in New York, NY, USA, and six affiliated regional centres in the states of New York and New Jersey, with a 1:1 randomisation between standard of care (standard-of-care group) and SBRT plus standard of care (SBRT group). Randomisation was done with a computer-based algorithm with stratification by number of progressive sites of metastasis, receptor or driver genetic alteration status, primary site, and type of systemic therapy previously received. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, measured up to 12 months. We did a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by disease site. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is complete.",
        "Results/Findings": "From Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2021, 106 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care (n=51; 23 patients with breast cancer and 28 patients with NSCLC) or SBRT plus standard of care (n=55; 24 patients with breast cancer and 31 patients with NSCLC). 16 (34%) of 47 patients with breast cancer had triple-negative disease, and 51 (86%) of 59 patients with NSCLC had no actionable driver mutation. The study was closed to accrual before reaching the targeted sample size, after the primary efficacy endpoint was met during a preplanned interim analysis. The median follow-up was 11·6 months for patients in the standard-of-care group and 12·1 months for patients in the SBRT group. The median progression-free survival was 3·2 months (95% CI 2·0-4·5) for patients in the standard-of-care group versus 7·2 months (4·5-10·0) for patients in the SBRT group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·53, 95% CI 0·35-0·81; p=0·0035). The median progression-free survival was higher for patients with NSCLC in the SBRT group than for those with NSCLC in the standard-of-care group (10·0 months [7·2-not reached] vs 2·2 months [95% CI 2·0-4·5]; HR 0·41, 95% CI 0·22-0·75; p=0·0039), but no difference was found for patients with breast cancer (4·4 months [2·5-8·7] vs 4·2 months [1·8-5·5]; 0·78, 0·43-1·43; p=0·43). Grade 2 or worse adverse events occurred in 21 (41%) patients in the standard-of-care group and 34 (62%) patients in the SBRT group. Nine (16%) patients in the SBRT group had grade 2 or worse toxicities related to SBRT, including gastrointestinal reflux disease, pain exacerbation, radiation pneumonitis, brachial plexopathy, and low blood counts.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The trial showed that progression-free survival was increased in the SBRT plus standard-of-care group compared with standard of care only. Oligoprogression in patients with metastatic NSCLC could be effectively treated with SBRT plus standard of care, leading to more than a four-times increase in progression-free survival compared with standard of care only. By contrast, no benefit was observed in patients with oligoprogressive breast cancer. Further studies to validate these findings and understand the differential benefits are warranted.",

Men with early-stage disease should not be treated with bone-modifying agents to prevent recurrence, but could still receive these agents to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Men with advanced or metastatic disease should be offered endocrine therapy as first-line therapy, except in cases of visceral crisis or rapidly progressive disease. Targeted systemic therapy may be used to treat advanced or metastatic cancer using the same indications and combinations offered to women.

The improvement of PFS with palbociclib-letrozole was maintained in the next 2 subsequent lines of therapy and delayed the use of chemotherapy (40.4 vs. 29.9 months for palbociclib-letrozole vs. placebo-letrozole). Safety data were consistent with the known profile. Patients' quality of life was maintained.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With approximately 15 months of additional follow-up, palbociclib plus letrozole continued to demonstrate improved PFS compared with placebo plus letrozole in the overall population and across all patient subgroups, while the safety profile remained favorable and quality of life was maintained. These data confirm that palbociclib-letrozole should be considered the standard of care for first-line therapy in patients with ER+/HER2- ABC, including those with low disease burden or long disease-free interval.

        "Methods": "This narrative review summarizes the biological rationale behind the use of PARP inhibitors in breast cancer, as well as the available evidence, recent progress, and potential future applications of these agents. Recent studies have shown that the benefit of PARP inhibitors extends beyond patients with germline BRCA1/2-associated metastatic breast cancer to patients with somatic BRCA1/2 variants and to those with germline PALB2 alterations.

The primary study end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 65 months, 656 events triggered this protocol-specified analysis. The estimated disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 75% among patients receiving AC-T, 84% among those receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, and 81% among those receiving TCH. Estimated rates of overall survival were 87%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. No significant differences in efficacy (disease-free or overall survival) were found between the two trastuzumab regimens, whereas both were superior to AC-T. The rates of congestive heart failure and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group (P<0.001). Eight cases of acute leukemia were reported: seven in the groups receiving the anthracycline-based regimens and one in the TCH group subsequent to receiving an anthracycline outside the study.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Combined targeting of CDK4/6 and ER is now the standard of care for patients with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. However, acquired resistance to these therapies frequently leads to disease progression. As such, it is critical to identify the mechanisms by which resistance to CDK4/6-based therapies is acquired and also identify therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.",

Treatment with the p110α-selective PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib (BYL719), completely blocked the progression of acquired CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant xenografts in the absence of continued CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment in models of both PIK3CA mutant and wild-type ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the dalpiciclib group than in the placebo group (30·6 months [95% CI 30·6-not reached] vs 18·2 months [16·5-22·5]; stratified hazard ratio 0·51 [95% CI 0·38-0·69]; one-sided log-rank p<0·0001). Adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 271 (90%) of 302 patients in the dalpiciclib group and 18 (12%) of 153 patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (259 [86%] in the dalpiciclib group vs none in the placebo group) and leukopenia (201 [67%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported for 36 (12%) patients in the dalpiciclib group and ten (7%) patients in the placebo group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred, both in the dalpiciclib group (deaths from unknown causes).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our findings suggest that dalpiciclib plus letrozole or anastrozole could be a novel standard first-line treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and is an alternative option to the current treatment landscape.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Aromatase inhibitors are a standard of care for hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. We investigated whether the selective oestrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant could improve progression-free survival compared with anastrozole in postmenopausal patients who had not received previous endocrine therapy.",
        "Methods": "In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial, we recruited eligible patients with histologically confirmed oestrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive, or both, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer from 113 academic hospitals and community centres in 20 countries. Eligible patients were endocrine therapy-naive, with WHO performance status 0-2, and at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular injection; on days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 days thereafter) or anastrozole (1 mg orally daily) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1·1, intervention by surgery or radiotherapy because of disease deterioration, or death from any cause, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of randomised treatment (including placebo). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 17, 2012, and July 11, 2014, 524 patients were enrolled to this study. Of these, 462 patients were randomised (230 to receive fulvestrant and 232 to receive anastrozole). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the fulvestrant group than in the anastrozole group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·797, 95% CI 0·637-0·999, p=0·0486). Median progression-free survival was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·83-20·99) in the fulvestrant group versus 13·8 months (11·99-16·59) in the anastrozole group. The most common adverse events were arthralgia (38 [17%] in the fulvestrant group vs 24 [10%] in the anastrozole group) and hot flushes (26 [11%] in the fulvestrant group vs 24 [10%] in the anastrozole group). 16 (7%) of 228 patients in in the fulvestrant group and 11 (5%) of 232 patients in the anastrozole group discontinued because of adverse events.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Fulvestrant has superior efficacy and is a preferred treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received previous endocrine therapy compared with a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, a standard of care for first-line treatment of these patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) demonstrated a statistically significant progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) benefit in the phase III MONALEESA-7 trial of pre-/perimenopausal patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). The median OS was not reached in the ribociclib arm in the protocol-specified final analysis; we hence performed an exploratory OS and additional outcomes analysis with an extended follow-up (median, 53.5 months).",
        "Methods": "Patients were randomized to receive ET [goserelin plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) or tamoxifen] with ribociclib or placebo. OS was evaluated with a stratified Cox proportional hazard model and summarized with Kaplan-Meier methods.",
        "Results/Findings": "The intent-to-treat population included 672 patients. Median OS was 58.7 months with ribociclib versus 48.0 months with placebo [hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.96]. Kaplan-Meier estimated OS at 48 months was 60% and 50% with ribociclib and placebo, respectively. Subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the OS benefit, including patients who received NSAI and patients aged less than 40 years. Subsequent antineoplastic therapies following discontinuation were balanced between the ribociclib (77%) and placebo (78%) groups. Use of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors after discontinuation was higher with placebo (26%) versus ribociclib (13%). Time to first chemotherapy was significantly delayed with ribociclib versus placebo. No drug-drug interactions were observed between ribociclib and either NSAI.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Ribociclib plus ET continued to show significantly longer OS than ET alone in pre-/perimenopausal patients, including patients aged less than 40 years, with HR+/HER2- ABC with 53.5 months of median follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov,  ).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tucidinostat (formerly known as chidamide) is an oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor. In an exploratory study, the combination of tucidinostat with exemestane showed preliminary signs of encouraging anti-tumour activity in patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. To build on these findings, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of this combination in a randomised trial in a larger population of postmenopausal patients with advanced, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "We did the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 ACE trial at 22 specialist cancer centres in China. Eligible patients were postmenopausal women (aged ≥60 years or aged <60 years if their serum follicle-stimulating hormone and oestradiol concentrations were within postmenopausal ranges) with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, whose disease had relapsed or progressed after at least one endocrine therapy (either in advanced or metastatic or adjuvant setting), and who had at least one measurable lesion, adequate organ function, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate haematological and biochemical parameters. Endocrine therapy did not have to be the most recent therapy before randomisation, but recurrence or progression after the most recent therapy was a prerequisite. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) by a dynamic randomisation scheme via an interactive web-response system to receive 30 mg oral tucidinostat or placebo twice weekly. All patients in both groups also received 25 mg oral exemestane daily. Randomisation was stratified according to the presence of visceral metastases (yes vs no). Patients, investigators, study site staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the full analysis set population, comprising all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment and for whom at least one safety case report form was available. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . The study has reached the required number of events for final analysis of the primary endpoint. The trial is no longer enrolling patients, but follow-up for investigation of overall survival is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between July 20, 2015, and June 26, 2017, 365 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 244 to the tucidinostat group and 121 to the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up was 13·9 months (IQR 9·8-17·5). Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 7·4 months (95% CI 5·5-9·2) in the tucidinostat group and 3·8 months (3·7-5·5) in the placebo group (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·58-0·98]; p=0·033). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in either group were neutropenia (124 [51%] of 244 patients in the tucidinostat group vs three [2%] of 121 patients in the placebo group), thrombocytopenia (67 [27%] vs three [2%]), and leucopenia (46 [19%] vs three [2%]). Serious adverse events of any cause occurred in 51 (21%) of 244 patients in the tucidinostat group and seven (6%) of 121 patients in the placebo group. No treatment-related deaths were reported.",

TORCHLIGHT is a randomized, double-blinded phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of first-line toripalimab and nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) (n = 353; experimental arm) versus placebo and nab-P (n = 178; control arm) for the treatment of women with metastatic or recurrent TNBC. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review in the PD-L1-positive and intention-to-treat populations. The secondary end points included overall survival and safety. Overall, 200 and 100 patients, in the toripalimab and placebo arm respectively had PD-L1-positive TNBC. At the prespecified interim analysis, a statistically significant improvement in PFS assessed by a blinded independent central review was demonstrated in the experimental arm in the PD-L1-positive population (median PFS 8.4 versus 5.6 months; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.470-0.906, P = 0.0102). The median overall survival was 32.8 versus 19.5 months (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.414-0.914, P = 0.0148). Similar incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (99.2% versus 98.9%), grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs (56.4% versus 54.3%) and fatal AEs (0.6% versus 3.4%) occurred in the experimental and control arms.

We conduct a randomized phase 3, controlled, open-label trial to compare nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin (AP) with gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) in mTNBC patients (ClinicalTrials.gov  ). 254 patients with untreated mTNBC randomly receive AP (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m² on day 1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m² on day 1) or GP (gemcitabine 1250 mg/m² on day 1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m² on day 1) intravenously every 3 weeks until progression disease, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints are objective response rate (ORR), safety and overall survival (OS). The trial has met pre-specified endpoints. The median PFS is 9.8 months with AP as compared to 7.4 months with GP (stratified HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.88; P = 0.004). AP significantly increases ORR (81.1% vs. 56.3%, P < 0.001) and prolongs OS (stratified HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.90; P = 0.010) to GP. Of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, a significantly higher incidence of neuropathy in AP and thrombocytopenia in GP is noted. These findings warrant further assessment of adding novel agents to the nab-paclitaxel/platinum backbone due to its high potency for patients with mTNBC.",

The current study examined a 12-week physical activity intervention, compared with a control condition, on objective and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors.",
        "Methods": "Sedentary breast cancer survivors were randomized to an exercise arm (n = 43) or a control arm (n = 44). At baseline and at 12 weeks, objective cognition was measured with the National Institutes of Health Cognitive Toolbox, and self-reported cognition using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales. Linear mixed-effects regression models tested intervention effects for changes in cognition scores.",
        "Results/Findings": "On average, participants (n = 87) were aged 57 years (standard deviation, 10.4 years) and were 2.5 years (standard deviation, 1.3 years) post surgery. Scores on the Oral Symbol Digit subscale (a measure of processing speed) evidenced differential improvement in the exercise arm versus the control arm (b = 2.01; P < .05). The between-group differences in improvement on self-reported cognition were not statistically significant but were suggestive of potential group differences. Time since surgery moderated the correlation, and participants who were ≤2 years post surgery had a significantly greater improvement in Oral Symbol Digit score (exercise vs control (b = 4.00; P < .01), but no significant improvement was observed in patients who were >2 years postsurgery (b = -1.19; P = .40). A significant dose response was observed with greater increased physical activity associated with objective and self-reported cognition in the exercise arm.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The exercise intervention significantly improved processing speed, but only among those who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 2 years. Slowed processing speed can have substantial implications for independent functioning, supporting the potential importance of early implementation of an exercise intervention among patients with breast cancer.

        "Background/Purpose": "To determine whether biochemical modulation with LV (leucovorin) enhances the efficacy of CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) against metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Women with histologically confirmed stage IV breast cancer, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status 0 to 2, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive CAF (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 day 1, and fluorouracil [FU] 200 mg/m2 intravenous bolus days 1 to 5) with or without LV (LV 200 mg/m2 over 30 minutes days 1 to 5 given 1 hour before FU).",
        "Results/Findings": "Two hundred forty-two patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 124 patients had visceral crisis and 40 patients had a CALGB performance status score of 2. The median follow-up was 6 years. The two study arms were similar with regard to serious adverse events; four patients died from treatment-related causes, two patients on each study arm. Predictive variables for time to treatment failure and survival were visceral disease and performance status. The overall response rate was 29% for CAF versus 28% for CAF plus LV. The median time to treatment failure (9 months) and median survival (1.7 years) did not differ by treatment arm.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Modulation of CAF with LV improved neither response rates nor survival among women with metastatic breast cancer, compared with CAF alone. Multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic importance of performance status and visceral crisis. However, the overall and complete response rates, response durations, time to treatment failure, and survival were the same in the two treatment arms.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To evaluate the survival of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and negative metastatic breast cancer irradiated for brain metastases before and after the availability of trastuzumab (T).",
        "Methods": "Women diagnosed with brain metastasis from breast cancer in two eras between 2000 and 2007 (T-era, n = 441) and 1986 to 1992 (PreT-era, n = 307), treated with whole brain radiotherapy (RT) were identified. In the T-era, HER2 testing was part of routine clinical practice, and in the preT-era 128/307 (42%) cases had HER2 testing performed retrospectively on tissue microarrays. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons between eras used log-rank tests.",

        "Background/Purpose": "CLEOPATRA was a phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In the primary analysis and subsequent reports, progression-free and overall survival were significantly improved in the pertuzumab group compared with the placebo group. Here, we report the end-of-study analysis of CLEOPATRA.",
        "Methods": "This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 204 centres in 25 countries. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer, had not received previous chemotherapy or biological treatment for their metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. All study drugs were given intravenously, every 3 weeks. Patients were assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo at a loading dose of 840 mg, and 420 mg thereafter; plus trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg loading dose and 6 mg/kg thereafter; and docetaxel at 75 mg/m , escalating to 100 mg/m  if tolerated. Pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab were given until disease progression; docetaxel was given for six cycles, or longer at the investigators' discretion. Randomisation (1:1) was done by use of an interactive voice-response system and was stratified by geographical region (Asia, Europe, North America, or South America) and previous treatment (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs none). The primary endpoint was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival, which has been reported previously. Since the confirmatory overall survival analysis had also occurred before this prespecified end-of-study analysis, analyses presented here are descriptive. Overall survival analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with crossover patients analysed in the placebo group; analyses were not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and are likely to be conservative. Safety analyses were based on treatment received; crossover patients were counted in the placebo group up to the day before first pertuzumab dose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 12, 2008, and July 7, 2010, 1196 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 808 were enrolled and randomly assigned. 402 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 406 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus placebo. Clinical cutoff for this analysis was Nov 23, 2018. Between July 2012 and clinical cutoff, 50 patients crossed from the placebo to the pertuzumab group. Median follow-up was 99·9 months in the pertuzumab group (IQR 92·9-106·4) and 98·7 months (90·9-105·7) in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 57·1 months (95% CI 50-72) in the pertuzumab group and 40·8 months (36-48) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·58-0·82); 8-year landmark overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI 31-42) in the pertuzumab group and 23% (19-28) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (200 [49%] of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group, 183 [46%] of 396 patients in the placebo group). Five (1%) of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group and six (2%) of 396 patients in the placebo group had treatment-related deaths. One new serious adverse event suggestive of congestive heart failure (pertuzumab group) and one new symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (post-crossover) occurred since the previous analysis.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our analysis shows that the previously observed improvements in overall survival with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained after a median of more than 8 years of follow-up. The long-term safety and cardiac safety profiles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained in the overall safety population and within crossover patients. HER2-targeted therapy has changed the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the dual blockade of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with docetaxel, demonstrating an 8-year landmark overall survival rate of 37%.",

        "Methods": "Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = 1,026) or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n = 1,020) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression).",
        "Results/Findings": "Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; P = .001). Reduction in bone turnover markers was greater with denosumab. Overall survival, disease progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between groups. An excess of renal AEs and acute-phase reactions occurred with zoledronic acid; hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (2.0%, denosumab; 1.4%, zoledronic acid; P = .39).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing SREs in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well tolerated.

A 78-year-old man was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (T4d N3 M1, stage IV). He had advanced breast cancer consisting of multiple tumors with skin involvement and redness over the entire left chest region. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a metastatic tumor in the left lung. Histologically, both the primary breast cancer and the metastatic lung tumor were identified as invasive ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor-negative (ER)(-) and progesterone receptor-negative (PgR)(-), with a HER2 score of 3+ (IHC). The patient received a combination chemotherapy using trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Two months later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the left lung tumor had disappeared, suggesting a good response to trastuzumab and paclitaxel. During trastuzumab treatment, no severe adverse events above grade 3 were observed. This is the first reported case of advanced HER2-positive male breast cancer in which a good response to trastuzumab and paclitaxel was demonstrated at both primary breast cancer and metastatic sites.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with antiestrogen therapies significantly improves clinical outcomes in ER-positive advanced breast cancer. To identify mechanisms of acquired resistance, we analyzed serial biopsies and rapid autopsies from patients treated with the combination of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib with letrozole. This study revealed that some resistant tumors acquired RB loss, whereas other tumors lost PTEN expression at the time of progression. In breast cancer cells, ablation of  , through increased AKT activation, was sufficient to promote resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition   and  . Mechanistically,   loss resulted in exclusion of p27 from the nucleus, leading to increased activation of both CDK4 and CDK2. Because   loss also causes resistance to PI3Kα inhibitors, currently approved in the post-CDK4/6 setting, these findings provide critical insight into how this single genetic event may cause clinical cross-resistance to multiple targeted therapies in the same patient, with implications for optimal treatment-sequencing strategies. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis of serial biopsies uncovered RB and PTEN loss as mechanisms of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, utilized as first-line treatment for ER-positive advanced breast cancer. Importantly, these findings have near-term clinical relevance because   loss also limits the efficacy of PI3Kα inhibitors currently approved in the post-CDK4/6 setting. .",

The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, first testing group A versus group C and, if this result was significant, then group B versus group C. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May 31, 2016, and Feb 28, 2018, 325 patients were screened, of whom 237 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups A (n=79), B (n=79), and C (n=79). Median follow-up was 19·0 months (IQR 14·7-25·1). The study met its primary endpoint, showing a significant difference at the prespecified two-sided α of 0·2 in median progression-free survival between group A (8·3 months, 95% CI 5·9-12·6) and group C (5·7 months, 5·4-7·0; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·45-1·00]; p=0·051). No difference was observed between median progression-free survival in group B (5·7 months, 95% CI 4·2-7·2) and group C (HR 0·94 [0·64-1·38]; p=0·77). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event in groups A, B, and C was neutropenia (21 [27%] of 78 patients, 17 [22%] of 77, and 19 [26%] of 72). The most common serious adverse events were: in group A, pyrexia (three [4%]), diarrhoea (two [3%]), urinary tract infection (two [3%]), and acute kidney injury (two [3%]); in group B, diarrhoea (two [3%]) and pneumonitis (two [3%]); and in group C, neutropenia (four [6%]) and pleural effusion (two [3%]). Two deaths were attributed to treatment: one due to pulmonary fibrosis in group B and one due to febrile neutropenia in group C.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The combination of abemaciclib, fulvestrant, and trastuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy plus trastuzumab while showing a tolerable safety profile. Our results suggest that a chemotherapy-free regimen might potentially be an alternative treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus targets aberrant signaling through the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, a mechanism of resistance to anti-estrogen therapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. We hypothesized that everolimus plus the selective ER downregulator fulvestrant would be more efficacious than fulvestrant alone in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study included 131 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer randomly assigned to fulvestrant (500 mg days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of cycles 2 and beyond) plus everolimus or placebo. The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% improvement in median progression-free survival from 5.4 months to 9.2 months. Secondary end points included objective response and clinical benefit rate (response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). Prophylactic corticosteroid mouth rinses were not used. Results The addition of everolimus to fulvestrant improved the median progression-free survival from 5.1 to 10.3 months (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92]; stratified log-rank P = .02), indicating that the primary trial end point was met. Objective response rates were similar (18.2% v 12.3%; P = .47), but the clinical benefit rate was significantly higher in the everolimus arm (63.6% v 41.5%; P = .01). Adverse events of all grades occurred more often in the everolimus arm, including oral mucositis (53% v 12%), fatigue (42% v 22%), rash (38% v 5%), anemia (31% v. 6%), diarrhea (23% v 8%), hyperglycemia (19% v 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (17% v 3%), and pneumonitis (17% v 0%), although grade 3 to 4 events were uncommon. Conclusion Everolimus enhances the efficacy of fulvestrant in AI-resistant, ER-positive metastatic breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer in whom disease progresses or there is recurrence while taking a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) are usually treated with exemestane (EXE), but no single standard of care exists in this setting. The BOLERO-2 trial demonstrated that adding everolimus (EVE) to EXE improved progression-free survival (PFS) while maintaining quality of life when compared with EXE alone. Because many women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer are elderly, the tolerability profile of EVE plus EXE in this population is of interest.",
        "Methods": "BOLERO-2, a phase III randomized trial, compared EVE (10 mg/d) and placebo (PBO), both plus EXE (25 mg/d), in 724 postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer recurring/progressing after treatment with NSAIs. Safety and efficacy data in elderly patients are reported at 18-month median follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "Baseline disease characteristics and treatment histories among the elderly subsets (≥ 65 years, n = 275; ≥ 70 years, n = 164) were generally comparable with younger patients. The addition of EVE to EXE improved PFS regardless of age (hazard ratio, 0.59 [≥ 65 years] and 0.45 [≥ 70 years]). Adverse events (AEs) of special interest (all grades) that occurred more frequently with EVE than with PBO included stomatitis, infections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia. Elderly EVE-treated patients had similar incidences of these AEs as did younger patients but had more on-treatment deaths.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adding EVE to EXE offers substantially improved PFS over EXE and was generally well tolerated in elderly patients with HR(+) advanced breast cancer. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose reductions or interruptions for AE management are recommended during treatment with EVE in this patient population.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) affect 65-85% of women after breast cancer treatment; they are distressing, causing sleep problems and decreased quality of life. Hormone replacement therapy is often either undesirable or contraindicated. Safe, effective non-hormonal treatments are needed. We investigated whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help breast cancer survivors to effectively manage HFNS.",
        "Methods": "In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited women from breast clinics in London, UK, who had problematic HFNS (minimum ten problematic episodes a week) after breast-cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either usual care or usual care plus group CBT (1:1). Randomisation was done in blocks of 12-20 participants, stratifying by age (younger than 50 years, 50 years or older), and was done with a computer-generated sequence. The trial statistician and researchers collecting outcome measures were masked to group allocation. Group CBT comprised one 90 min session a week for 6 weeks, and included psycho-education, paced breathing, and cognitive and behavioural strategies to manage HFNS. Assessments were done at baseline, 9 weeks, and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference in HFNS problem rating (1-10) between CBT and usual care groups at 9 weeks after randomisation. Analysis of the primary endpoint was done by modified intention to treat. The trial is registered, ISRCTN13771934, and was closed March 15, 2011.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May 5, 2009, and Aug 27, 2010, 96 women were randomly allocated to group CBT (n=47) or usual care (n=49). Group CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 9 weeks after randomisation compared with usual care (mean difference -1·67, 95% CI -2·43 to -0·91; p<0·0001) and improvements were maintained at 26 weeks (mean difference -1·76, -2·54 to -0·99; p<0·0001). We recorded no CBT-related adverse events.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Group CBT seems to be a safe and effective treatment for women who have problematic HFNS after breast cancer treatment with additional benefits to mood, sleep, and quality of life. The treatment could be incorporated into breast cancer survivorship programmes and delivered by trained breast cancer nurses.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Mind-body therapies are commonly recommended to treat vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence to date for the efficacy of different mind-body therapies to alleviate HFNS in healthy menopausal women and breast cancer survivors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using seven electronic search engines, direct searches of specific journals and backwards searches through reference lists of related publications. Outcome measures included HFNS frequency and/or severity or self-reported problem rating at post-treatment. The methodological quality of all studies was systematically assessed using predefined criteria. Twenty-six RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included yoga (n = 5), hypnosis (n = 3), mindfulness (n = 2), relaxation (n = 7), paced breathing (n = 4), reflexology (n = 1) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 4). Findings were consistent for the effectiveness of CBT and relaxation therapies for alleviating troublesome vasomotor symptoms. For the remaining interventions, although some trials indicated beneficial effects (within groups) at post-treatment and/or follow up, between group findings were mixed and overall, methodological differences across studies failed to provide convincing supporting evidence. Collectively, findings suggest that interventions that include breathing and relaxation techniques, as well as CBT, can be beneficial for alleviating vasomotor symptoms. Additional large, methodologically rigorous trials are needed to establish the efficacy of interventions on vasomotor symptoms, examine long-term outcomes and understand how they work.",

        "Background/Purpose": "BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutated breast cancers are sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum agents owing to deficiency in homologous recombination repair of DNA damage. In this trial, we compared veliparib versus placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and continued as monotherapy if carboplatin and paclitaxel were discontinued before progression, in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.",
        "Methods": "BROCADE3 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 147 hospitals in 36 countries. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) had deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation-associated, histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced HER2-negative breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received up to two previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive response technology by means of permuted blocks within strata (block size of 3 or 6) to carboplatin (area under the concentration curve 6 mg/mL per min intravenously) on day 1 and paclitaxel (80 mg/m  intravenously) on days 1, 8, and 15 of 21-day cycles combined with either veliparib (120 mg orally twice daily, on days -2 to 5) or matching placebo. If patients discontinued carboplatin and paclitaxel before progression, they could continue veliparib or placebo at an intensified dose (300 mg twice daily continuously, escalating to 400 mg twice daily if tolerated) until disease progression. Patients in the control group could receive open-label veliparib monotherapy after disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by previous platinum use, history of CNS metastases, and oestrogen and progesterone receptor status. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat, which included all randomly assigned patients with a centrally confirmed BRCA mutation, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of velilparib or placebo.

        "Results/Findings": "Between July 30, 2014, and Jan 17, 2018, 2202 patients were screened, of whom 513 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. In the intention-to-treat population (n=509), 337 patients were assigned to receive veliparib plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (veliparib group) and 172 were assigned to receive placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (control group). Median follow-up at data cutoff (April 5, 2019) was 35·7 months (IQR 24·9-43·6) in the veliparib group and 35·5 months (23·1-45·9) in the control group. Median progression-free survival was 14·5 months (95% CI 12·5-17·7) in the veliparib group versus 12·6 months (10·6-14·4) in the control group (hazard ratio 0·71 [95% CI 0·57-0·88], p=0·0016). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (272 [81%] of 336 patients in the veliparib group vs 143 [84%] of 171 patients in the control group), anaemia (142 [42%] vs 68 [40%]), and thrombocytopenia (134 [40%] vs 48 [28%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 115 (34%) patients in the veliparib group versus 49 (29%) patients in the control group. There were no study drug-related deaths.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Platinum chemotherapy has a role in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer but its full potential has probably not yet been reached. We assessed whether a cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen was non-inferior to or superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "For this open-label, randomised, phase 3, hybrid-designed trial undertaken at 12 institutions or hospitals in China, we included Chinese patients aged 18-70 years with previously untreated, histologically confirmed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and an ECOG performance status of 0-1. These patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either cisplatin plus gemcitabine (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) or paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) given intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of eight cycles. Randomisation was done centrally via an interactive web response system using block randomisation with a size of eight, with no stratification factors. Patients and investigator were aware of group assignments. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and analyses were based on all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was 1·2. If non-inferiority of cisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with paclitaxel plus gemcitabine was achieved, we would then test for superiority. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "From Jan 14, 2011, to Nov 14, 2013, 240 patients were assessed for eligibility and randomly assigned to treatment (120 in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 120 in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group). 236 patients received at least one dose of assigned chemotherapy and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (118 per group). After a median follow-up of 16·3 months (IQR 14·4-26·8) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 15·9 months (10·7-25·4) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0·692 (95% CI 0·523-0·915; pnon-inferiority<0·0001, psuperiority=0·009, thus cisplatin plus gemcitabine was both non-inferior to and superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Median progression-free survival was 7·73 months (95% CI 6·16-9·30) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 6·47 months (5·76-7·18) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that differed significantly between the two groups included nausea (eight [7%] vs one [<1%]), vomiting (13 [11%] vs one [<1%]), musculoskeletal pain (none vs ten [8%]), anaemia (39 [33%] vs six [5%]), and thrombocytopenia (38 [32%] vs three [3%]), for the cisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine groups, respectively. In addition, patients in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group had significantly fewer events of grade 1-4 alopecia (12 [10%] vs 42 [36%]) and peripheral neuropathy (27 [23%] vs 60 [51%]), but more grade 1-4 anorexia (33 [28%] vs 10 [8%]), constipation (29 [25%] vs 11 [9%]), hypomagnesaemia (27 [23%] vs five [4%]), and hypokalaemia (10 [8%] vs two [2%]). Serious drug-related adverse events were seen in three patients in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group (interstitial pneumonia, anaphylaxis, and severe neutropenia) and four in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group (pathological bone fracture, thrombocytopenia with subcutaneous haemorrhage, severe anaemia, and cardiogenic syncope). There were no treatment-related deaths.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Cisplatin plus gemcitabine could be an alternative or even the preferred first-line chemotherapy strategy for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Pembrolizumab monotherapy showed durable antitumour activity and manageable safety in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We aimed to examine whether the addition of pembrolizumab would enhance the antitumour activity of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial, done in 209 sites in 29 countries, we randomly assigned patients 2:1 with untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using a block method (block size of six) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel; paclitaxel; or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by type of on-study chemotherapy (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 expression at baseline (combined positive score [CPS] ≥1 or <1), and previous treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (yes or no). Eligibility criteria included age at least 18 years, centrally confirmed triple-negative breast cancer; at least one measurable lesion; provision of a newly obtained tumour sample for determination of triple-negative breast cancer status and PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 0 or 1; and adequate organ function. The sponsor, investigators, other study site staff (except for the unmasked pharmacist), and patients were masked to pembrolizumab versus saline placebo administration. In addition, the sponsor, the investigators, other study site staff, and patients were masked to patient-level tumour PD-L1 biomarker results. Dual primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival assessed in the PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, CPS of 1 or more, and intention-to-treat populations. The definitive assessment of progression-free survival was done at this interim analysis; follow-up to assess overall survival is continuing. For progression-free survival, a hierarchical testing strategy was used, such that testing was done first in patients with CPS of 10 or more (prespecified statistical criterion was α=0·00411 at this interim analysis), then in patients with CPS of 1 or more (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis, with partial alpha from progression-free survival in patients with CPS of 10 or more passed over), and finally in the intention-to-treat population (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 9, 2017, and June 12, 2018, of 1372 patients screened, 847 were randomly assigned to treatment, with 566 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 281 patients in the placebo-chemotherapy group. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff, Dec 11, 2019), median follow-up was 25·9 months (IQR 22·8-29·9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 26·3 months (22·7-29·7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Among patients with CPS of 10 or more, median progression-free survival was 9·7 months with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy and 5·6 months with placebo-chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for progression or death, 0·65, 95% CI 0·49-0·86; one-sided p=0·0012 [primary objective met]). Median progression-free survival was 7·6 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·74, 0·61-0·90; one-sided p=0·0014 [not significant]) among patients with CPS of 1 or more and 7·5 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·82, 0·69-0·97 [not tested]) among the intention-to-treat population. The pembrolizumab treatment effect increased with PD-L1 enrichment. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event rates were 68% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 67% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in <1% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus placebo-chemotherapy among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with CPS of 10 or more. These findings suggest a role for the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Less than 1% of breast cancers occur in males, and the optimal hormonal therapy in this setting is unknown. Tamoxifen is effective in this entity, but unfortunately there is little information on aromatase inhibitors (AI) or fulvestrant. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). In this report we report 11 months of progression-free survival, without any adverse events, in a patient who received trastuzumab and anastrozole therapy. We conclude that this combination is a reasonable option in men with ER+ and Her2+ advanced breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "In this open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial, pre/perimenopausal women with clinically aggressive HR+/HER2- ABC were randomly assigned 1:1 to first-line ribociclib (600 mg once daily; 3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus letrozole/anastrozole and goserelin or investigator's choice of combination CT (docetaxel plus capecitabine, paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, or capecitabine plus vinorelbine). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 222 patients randomly assigned to ribociclib plus ET (n = 112) or combination CT (n = 110), 150 (67.6%) had symptomatic visceral metastases, 41 (18.5%) had rapid disease progression per investigator's judgment, and 31 (14.0%) had symptomatic nonvisceral disease. Overall, 106 (47.7%) patients had investigator-assessed visceral crisis. The median follow-up time was 37.0 months. At data cutoff, 31.3% (ribociclib arm) and 15.5% (CT arm) of patients had completed study treatment and transitioned to post-trial access. The median PFS was 21.8 months (ribociclib plus ET; [95% CI, 17.4 to 26.7]) and 12.8 months (combination CT; [95% CI, 10.1 to 18.4); hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.87];   = .003.

The randomized HABITS study, which compared HT for menopausal symptoms with best management without hormones among women with previously treated breast cancer, was stopped early due to suspicions of an increased risk of new breast cancer events following HT. We present results after extended follow-up.",
        "Methods": "HABITS was a randomized, non-placebo-controlled noninferiority trial that aimed to be at a power of 80% to detect a 36% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for a new breast cancer event following HT. Cox models were used to estimate relative risks of a breast cancer event, the maximum likelihood method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and chi(2) tests were used to assess statistical significance, with all P values based on two-sided tests. The absolute risk of a new breast cancer event was estimated with the cumulative incidence function. Most patients who received HT were prescribed continuous combined or sequential estradiol hemihydrate and norethisterone.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 447 women randomly assigned, 442 could be followed for a median of 4 years. Thirty-nine of the 221 women in the HT arm and 17 of the 221 women in the control arm experienced a new breast cancer event (HR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.2). Cumulative incidences at 5 years were 22.2% in the HT arm and 8.0% in the control arm.

The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors for extracranial oligometastatic breast cancer and to identify the best treatment approaches in this select population. Fifty postoperative inpatients diagnosed with extracranial oligometastatic breast cancer at the National Cancer Center in China between 2009 and 2014 were consecutively enrolled. Oligometastatic breast cancer was defined as MBC with three or fewer metastatic lesions confined to one organ; de novo Stage IV disease and local-regional recurrence were excluded. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were 15.2 and 78.9 months, respectively, and the 2-year PFS and 5-year OS rates were 40% and 58%, respectively. First-line treatment approach with standard systemic treatment + surgical resection for all metastatic lesions was an independent prognostic factor for prolonged PFS (hazard ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.73; P = .006) and OS (hazard ratio = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86; P = .022). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a disease-free interval (DFI) ≥24 months, one metastatic lesion or the hormone receptor (HR) + subtype were more likely to get benefit from resection. Patients with oligometastatic breast cancer have a relatively good prognosis. Surgical resection for metastatic lesions could significantly improve PFS and OS.

The phase 3b/4 DESTINY-Breast12 study investigated T-DXd in patients with HER2  mBC and is, to our knowledge, the largest prospective study of T-DXd in patients with BMs in this setting. Patients (stable/active BMs (n = 263) and no BMs (n = 241)) treated with one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens received T-DXd (5.4 mg per kg). Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS; BMs cohort) and objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (non-BMs cohort). Additional endpoints included central nervous system (CNS) PFS, ORR, time to second progression, CNS ORR (BMs cohort), incidence of new symptomatic CNS metastases (non-BMs cohort), time to progression, duration of response, overall survival and safety (both cohorts). No formal hypothesis testing was conducted for this single-arm, open-label study. In the BMs cohort, 12-month PFS was 61.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.9-67.6), and 12-month CNS PFS was 58.9% (95% CI: 51.9-65.3). In the non-BMs cohort, ORR was 62.7% (95% CI: 56.5-68.8). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 51% (BMs cohort) and 49% (non-BMs cohort) of patients. Investigator-reported interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in 16% (grade ≥3: 3%) of patients with BMs and 13% (grade ≥3: 1%) of patients without BMs. These data show substantial and durable overall and intracranial activity for T-DXd, supporting its use in previously treated patients with HER2  mBC irrespective of stable/active baseline BMs. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:   .",

        "Methods": "Eligible metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) women without prior treatment for advanced disease were randomized (1 : 1) to receive either docetaxel-cisplatin (TP) or docetaxel -capecitabine (TX) q3w for up to 6 cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In total 53 patients were enrolled.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up was 24 months. ORR was higher in the TP group than in the TX group (63.0% versus 15.4%, P = 0.001).

        "Background/Purpose": "Olaparib is an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that has promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which olaparib monotherapy was compared with standard therapy in patients with a germline BRCA mutation and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or standard therapy with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine in 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review and was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 302 patients who underwent randomization, 205 were assigned to receive olaparib and 97 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the standard-therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.80; P<0.001). The response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib group and 28.8% in the standard-therapy group. The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard-therapy group, and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxic effects was 4.9% and 7.7%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation, olaparib monotherapy provided a significant benefit over standard therapy; median progression-free survival was 2.8 months longer and the risk of disease progression or death was 42% lower with olaparib monotherapy than with standard therapy.

Final efficacy secondary end point analyses and post hoc analyses of outcomes stratified by Trop-2 expression and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status are reported. Updated safety analyses are provided.In this final analysis, SG (n = 267) improved median progression-free survival (PFS; 4.8   1.7 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.41 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.52]) and median overall survival (OS; 11.8   6.9 months; HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.63]) over TPC (n = 262). SG improved PFS over TPC in each Trop-2 expression quartile (n = 168); a trend was observed for improved OS across quartiles. Overall, SG had a manageable safety profile, with ≤5% of treatment-related discontinuations because of adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. The safety profile was consistent across all subgroups.These data confirm the clinical benefit of SG over chemotherapy, reinforcing SG as an effective treatment option in patients with mTNBC in the second line or later.",

Multivariable analyses showed that age, race, marital status, grade, tumor subtype, tumor size, surgery of primary cancer, and a history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Stage IV breast cancer patients have different clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes according to different metastatic sites. Patients with bone metastasis have the best prognosis, and brain metastasis is the most aggressive subgroup.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Multiple studies have suggested that resection of the primary tumor improves survival in patients with stage IV breast cancer, yet in the era of targeted therapy, the relation between surgery and tumor molecular subtype is unknown. The objective of the current study was to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from primary tumor treatment and assess the frequency of local disease progression.",
        "Methods": "Patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer and intact primary tumors (n = 186) were identified from a prospectively maintained clinical database (2000-2004) and clinical data were abstracted (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system).",
        "Results/Findings": "Surgery was performed in 69 (37%) patients: 34 (49%) patients with unknown metastatic disease at the time of surgery, 15 (22%) patients for local control, 14 (20%) patients for palliation, and in 6 (9%) patients to obtain tissue. Surgical patients were more likely to be HER-2/neu negative (P = .001), and to have smaller tumors (P = .05) and solitary metastasis (P <.001). Local therapy included axillary lymph node clearance in 33 (48%) patients and postoperative radiotherapy in 9 (13%) patients. The median survival was 35 months. Cox regression analysis identified estrogen receptor (ER) positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.29-0.76), progesterone receptor (PR) positivity (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90), and HER-2/neu amplification (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.77) as being predictive of improved survival. There was a trend toward improved survival with surgery (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.06). On exploratory analyses, surgery was found to be associated with improved survival in patients with ER/PR positive or HER-2/neu-amplified disease (P = .004). No survival benefit was observed in patients with triple-negative disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although a trend toward improved survival with surgery was observed, it was noted most strongly in patients with ER/PR positive and/or HER-2/neu-amplified disease. This suggests that the impact of local control is greatest in the presence of effective targeted therapy, and supports the need for further study to define patient subsets that will benefit most.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Our aim was to evaluate the impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease and on the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "The medical records of 125 consecutive patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer referred for FDG PET from January 1998 through May 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. The rationale for FDG PET referral and the impact of FDG PET on subsequent treatment decisions for patients were determined by chart review. The impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease was determined by comparing the FDG PET interpretation at the time of the examination with findings from conventional imaging (CI) performed before FDG PET. FDG PET results were confirmed in nearly half (n = 61) of the patients by histopathology (n = 23) or follow-up imaging (n = 38; mean follow-up interval, 21.3 months).",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients were referred for FDG PET for the following reasons: evaluation of disease response or viability after therapy (n = 43 [35%]), local recurrence, with intent of aggressive local treatment (n = 39 [31%]), equivocal findings on CI (n = 25 [20%]), evaluation of disease extent in patients with known metastases (n = 13 [10%]), and elevated tumor markers with unknown disease site (n = 5 [4%]). Compared with CI findings, the extent of disease increased in 54 (43%), did not change in 41 (33%), and decreased in 30 (24%) of 125 patients using FDG PET. Results of FDG PET altered the therapeutic plan in 40 (32%), directly helped to support the therapeutic plan in 34 (27%), and did not change the plan devised before FDG PET in 51 (41%) of 125 patients. FDG PET altered therapy most frequently in the patients suspected of having locoregional recurrence and in those being evaluated for treatment response versus other referral categories (p = 0.04). For patients with confirmation of FDG PET findings, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG PET were 94%, 91%, and 92%, respectively.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is one of the most important toxicities of antiresorptive therapy, which is standard practice for patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. However, the population-based incidence of MRONJ is not well established. We therefore performed a retrospective multicenter study to assess the incidence for a whole Austrian federal state (Tyrol).",
        "Methods": "This retrospective multicenter study was conducted between 2000 and 2020 at all nine breast centers across Tyrol, Austria. Using the cancer registry, the total Tyrolean population was screened for all patients with breast cancer. All patients with breast cancer and bone metastases receiving antiresorptive therapy were finally included in the study.",
        "Results/Findings": "From 8,860 patients initially screened, 639 individuals were eligible and included in our study. Patients received antiresorptive therapy once per month without de-escalation of therapy. MRONJ was diagnosed in 56 (8.8%, 95% CI, 6.6 to 11.0) patients. The incidence of MRONJ was 11.6% (95% CI, 8.0 to 15.3) in individuals treated with denosumab only, 2.8% (95% CI, 0.7 to 4.8) in those treated with bisphosphonates only, and 16.3% (95% CI, 8.8 to 23.9) in the group receiving bisphosphonates followed by denosumab. Individuals developed MRONJ significantly earlier when treated with denosumab. Time to MRONJ after treatment initiation was 4.6 years for individuals treated with denosumab only, 5.1 years for individuals treated with bisphosphonates only, and 8.4 years for individuals treated with both consecutively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "MRONJ incidence in breast cancer patients with bone metastases was found to be considerably higher, especially for patients receiving denosumab, when compared with available data in the literature. Additionally, patients treated with denosumab developed MRONJ significantly earlier.",

Capivasertib-fulvestrant is approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with one or more tumor biomarker alterations (PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN). Here, we report outcomes in the CAPItello-291 subgroup of patients from Japan.",
        "Methods": "Adults with HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer whose disease had relapsed or progressed during or after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with or without previous cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapy, were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive capivasertib or placebo, plus fulvestrant. The dual primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS in the overall and PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered population. Safety was a secondary endpoint.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 708 patients randomized in CAPItello-291, 78 were from Japan (37 randomized to capivasertib-fulvestrant and 41 to placebo-fulvestrant). In the Japan subgroup, PFS numerically favored the capivasertib-fulvestrant arm (hazard ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.40-1.28), consistent with the analysis of PFS in the global population. Similarly, in the Japan subgroup of patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors, PFS favored the capivasertib-fulvestrant arm (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.29-1.39), consistent with the global population. The adverse event profile of capivasertib-fulvestrant in the Japan subgroup was broadly similar to that in the global population; no new safety concerns were identified.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The optimum timing of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain. The SENTINA (SENTinel NeoAdjuvant) study was designed to evaluate a specific algorithm for timing of a standardised sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure in patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "SENTINA is a four-arm, prospective, multicentre cohort study undertaken at 103 institutions in Germany and Austria. Women with breast cancer who were scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled into the study. Patients with clinically node-negative disease (cN0) underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm A). If the sentinel node was positive (pN1), a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure was done after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B). Women with clinically node-positive disease (cN+) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those who converted to clinically node-negative disease after chemotherapy (ycN0; arm C) were treated with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and axillary dissection. Only patients whose clinical nodal status remained positive (ycN1) underwent axillary dissection without sentinel-lymph-node biopsy (arm D). The primary endpoint was accuracy (false-negative rate) of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients who converted from cN1 to ycN0 disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm C). Secondary endpoints included comparison of the detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and also the false-negative rate and detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after removal of the sentinel lymph node. Analyses were done according to treatment received (per protocol).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1737 patients who received treatment, 1022 women underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arms A and B), with a detection rate of 99.1% (95% CI 98.3-99.6; 1013 of 1022). In patients who converted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from cN+ to ycN0 (arm C), the detection rate was 80.1% (95% CI 76.6-83.2; 474 of 592) and false-negative rate was 14.2% (95% CI 9.9-19.4; 32 of 226). The false-negative rate was 24.3% (17 of 70) for women who had one node removed and 18.5% (10 of 54) for those who had two sentinel nodes removed (arm C). In patients who had a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B), the detection rate was 60.8% (95% CI 55.6-65.9; 219 of 360) and the false-negative rate was 51.6% (95% CI 38.7-64.2; 33 of 64).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is a reliable diagnostic method before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After systemic treatment or early sentinel-lymph-node biopsy, the procedure has a lower detection rate and a higher false-negative rate compared with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy done before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These limitations should be considered if biopsy is planned after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials. This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).",
        "Methods": "This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57). Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance. Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.

        "Background/Purpose": "Platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) has proven benefits in phase III studies for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients; however, real-world data of large samples from multiple centers are lacking. Our study was to compare the effectiveness of PBC and non-PBC in advanced TNBC patients in multicenter real-world settings. Totally, 495 patients with advanced TNBC receiving PBC (n = 350) or non-PBC (n = 145) at four cancer centers in China between 2003 and 2019 were included. Treatment responses and outcomes were compared between the two groups from first-line to third-line treatment. Of patients with PBC, 249 (71.1%) received PBC from first-line chemotherapy, 86 (24.6%) from second-line and 15 (4.3%) from third-line treatment. In first-line treatment, PBC was superior to non-PBC in objective response rate (ORR, 53.0% vs 32.1%, P < .001) and median progression-free survival (PFS, 8.4 vs 6.0 months, P = .022), whereas overall survival (OS) was similar (19.2 vs 16.8 months, P = .439). When comparing patients receiving non-PBC doublets (n = 221) with those receiving PBC doublets (n = 249), the same trend was observed in ORR (32.6% vs 53.0%, P < .001), median first-line PFS (6.5 vs 8.4 months, P = .041) and median first-line OS(17.8 vs 19.2 months, P = .568). Paclitaxel/docetaxel + platinum was more likely to be used, followed by gemcitabine + platinum. In second/third-line treatment, PBC yielded a similar response and survival compared to non-PBC. Adding PBC in the first-line therapy was better than that in the latter-line of treatment in terms of ORR, PFS and OS (P < .001). Toxic effects of PBC were tolerable and the most common adverse event was neutropenia (38.6%).

This trial evaluated the effect of adding lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole as first-line treatment of hormone receptor (HR) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC were randomly assigned to daily letrozole (2.5 mg orally) plus lapatinib (1,500 mg orally) or letrozole and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the HER2-positive population. Results In HR-positive, HER2-positive patients (n = 219), addition of lapatinib to letrozole significantly reduced the risk of disease progression versus letrozole-placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .019); median PFS was 8.2 v 3.0 months, respectively.

Patients with centrally confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors (n = 952) had no improvement in PFS. A preplanned Cox regression analysis identified prior antiestrogen therapy as a significant factor in the HER2-negative population; a nonsignificant trend toward prolonged PFS for lapatinib-letrozole was seen in patients who experienced relapse less than 6 months since prior tamoxifen discontinuation (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P = .117).

The objective response rate was higher in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (62.6% vs. 27.2%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.8; P<0.001). Hematologic grade 3-4 adverse events (primarily anemia) occurred in 55% of the patients who received talazoparib and in 38% of the patients who received standard therapy; nonhematologic grade 3 adverse events occurred in 32% and 38% of the patients, respectively. Patient-reported outcomes favored talazoparib; significant overall improvements and significant delays in the time to clinically meaningful deterioration according to both the global health status-quality-of-life and breast symptoms scales were observed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation, single-agent talazoparib provided a significant benefit over standard chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival. Patient-reported outcomes were superior with talazoparib. (Funded by Medivation [Pfizer]; EMBRACA ClinicalTrials.gov number,   .).",

        "Background/Purpose": "CEREBEL compared the incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving lapatinib-capecitabine or trastuzumab-capecitabine.",
        "Methods": "Patients without baseline CNS metastases were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive lapatinib-capecitabine (lapatinib 1,250 mg per day; capecitabine 2,000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days) or trastuzumab-capecitabine (trastuzumab loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks; capecitabine 2,500 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days). The primary end point was incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).",
        "Results/Findings": "The study was terminated early with 540 enrolled patients (271 received lapatinib-capecitabine, and 269 received trastuzumab-capecitabine). Incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse was 3% (eight of 251 patients) for lapatinib-capecitabine and 5% (12 of 250 patients) for trastuzumab-capecitabine (treatment differences, -1.6%; 95% CI, -2% to 5%; P = .360).

        "Methods": "HER2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry, silver in situ hybridization (SISH), and FISH, in a series of 137 tumors, building up a tissue microarray to concurrently analyze each single PBC and metastatic (MBC) on the same slide.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER2 status was discordant in 14 cases (10%): 12 negative in PBC and positive in metastases and two positive in PBC and negative in metastases (P = 0.04). These findings were confirmed by a PCR based test termed Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). HER2 status changed in hormone receptor-positive BC more frequently than in negative ones (P = 0.002). In addition, we evaluated HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy number by SISH in the 123 cases with unchanged HER2 status during progression. We found consistent HER2 gene copy number stability in the 100 nonamplified cases. Conversely, of the 23 amplified PBC, 13 (57%) demonstrated a significant increase in the HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy number in their paired metastases (P = 0.01), as defined by SISH (k = 0.54, P < 0.0001) and MLPA.

        "Background/Purpose": "The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole inhibits estrogen synthesis. Fulvestrant binds and accelerates degradation of estrogen receptors. We hypothesized that these two agents in combination might be more effective than anastrozole alone in patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women with previously untreated metastatic disease were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 1 mg of anastrozole orally every day (group 1), with crossover to fulvestrant alone strongly encouraged if the disease progressed, or anastrozole and fulvestrant in combination (group 2). Patients were stratified according to prior or no prior receipt of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Fulvestrant was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly thereafter. The primary end point was progression-free survival, with overall survival designated as a prespecified secondary outcome.",

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 95 postmenopausal women with a prior history of stage 0-III breast cancer, who had completed active cancer treatment (including hormonal therapy) were randomly assigned 1:1 to either 3 mg oral melatonin (n = 48) or placebo daily (n = 47) for 4 months. Sleep, mood, and hot flashes were assessed at baseline and 4 months via self-administered questionnaire using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D), and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) hot flash diary, respectively. Eighty-six women (91 %) completed the study and provided pre- and post-questionnaires. At baseline, 52 % of participants reported poor sleep in the month prior to enrollment. Compared to subjects on placebo, subjects randomized to melatonin experienced significantly greater improvements in subjective sleep quality as measured by the PSQI, including domains on sleep quality, daytime dysfunction and total score. For example, the mean change in PSQI score was -0.1 in the placebo group compared to -1.9 in the melatonin group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in measures of depression or hot flashes. Sleep disturbances are common among breast cancer survivors, even after completion of active cancer treatment. This is the first randomized placebo-controlled study among breast cancer survivors to demonstrate that melatonin was associated with an improvement in subjective sleep quality, without any significant adverse effects.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Patients with brain metastases (BM) from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer represent a difficult-to-treat population. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has shown potential activity in this subset of patients in small clinical series.",
        "Methods": "KAMILLA is an ongoing, phase IIIb study of T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer with prior HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Patients received T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks (intravenously) until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or disease progression. Tumor response and clinical outcomes in patients with baseline BM were evaluated in this post hoc, exploratory analysis. The main outcome measures were best overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease lasting ≥6 months) by RECIST v1.1 criteria, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 2002 treated patients, 398 had baseline BM. In 126 patients with measurable BM, the best overall response rate and clinical benefit rate were 21.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 14.6-29.6] and 42.9% (95% CI 34.1-52.0), respectively. A reduction in the sum of the major diameters of BM ≥30% occurred in 42.9% (95% CI 34.1-52.0), including 49.3% (95% CI 36.9-61.8) of 67 patients without prior radiotherapy to BM. In the 398 patients with baseline BM, median progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.5 (95% CI 5.3-5.6) months and 18.9 (95% CI 17.1-21.3) months, respectively.

        "Background/Purpose": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) demonstrated significantly improved efficacy over trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in DESTINY-Breast03 (median follow-up, 28 months). We report updated efficacy and safety analyses, including secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints (median follow-up, 41 months) of DESTINY-Breast03. Patients with advanced HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with taxane and trastuzumab were randomized to T-DXd (5.4 mg per kg (261 patients)) or T-DM1 (3.6 mg per kg (263 patients)). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review and was previously reported. The key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Other secondary endpoints included objective response rate, duration of response and PFS (all by investigator assessment) and safety. At data cutoff, 20 November 2023, median PFS by investigator assessment was 29.0 versus 7.2 months (hazard ratio (HR), 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24-0.38), the 36-month PFS rate was 45.7% versus 12.4% and median OS was 52.6 versus 42.7 months (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94) with T-DXd versus T-DM1, respectively.

The aim of DESTINY-Breast03 was to compare the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab emtansine.",
        "Methods": "This open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done in 169 study centres in North America, Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. Eligible patients were aged 18 or older, had HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan 5·4 mg/kg or trastuzumab emtansine 3·6 mg/kg, both administered by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by hormone receptor status, previous treatment with pertuzumab, and history of visceral disease, and was managed through an interactive web-based system. Within each stratum, balanced block randomisation was used with a block size of four. Patients and investigators were not masked to the treatment received. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review. The key secondary endpoint was overall survival and this prespecified second overall survival interim analysis reports updated overall survival, efficacy, and safety results. Efficacy analyses were performed using the full analysis set. Safety analyses included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.

        "Results/Findings": "Between July 20, 2018, and June 23, 2020, 699 patients were screened for eligibility, 524 of whom were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (n=261) or trastuzumab emtansine (n=263). Median duration of study follow-up was 28·4 months (IQR 22·1-32·9) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 26·5 months (14·5-31·3) with trastuzumab emtansine. Median progression-free survival by blinded independent central review was 28·8 months (95% CI 22·4-37·9) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 6·8 months (5·6-8·2) with trastuzumab emtansine (hazard ratio [HR] 0·33 [95% CI 0·26-0·43]; nominal p<0·0001). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 40·5 months-not estimable), with 72 (28%) overall survival events, in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and was not reached (34·0 months-not estimable), with 97 (37%) overall survival events, in the trastuzumab emtansine group (HR 0·64; 95% CI 0·47-0·87]; p=0·0037). The number of grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab emtansine (145 [56%] patients versus 135 [52%] patients).

In this study, we compared pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for second-line or third-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "KEYNOTE-119 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 150 medical centres (academic medical centres, community cancer centres, and community hospitals) in 31 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, with centrally confirmed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, who had received one or two previous systemic treatments for metastatic disease, had progression on their most recent therapy, and had previous treatment with an anthracycline or taxane were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a block method (block size of four) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles (pembrolizumab group), or to single-drug chemotherapy per investigator's choice of capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine (60% enrolment cap for each; chemotherapy group). Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 tumour status (positive [combined positive score (CPS) ≥1] vs negative [CPS <1]) and history of previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment versus de-novo metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Primary endpoints were overall survival in participants with a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more, those with a CPS of 1 or more, and all participants; superiority of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was tested in all participants only if shown in those with a CPS of one or more. The primary endpoint was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was analysed in the all-subjects-as-treated population. This Article describes the final analysis of the trial, which is now completed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "From Nov 25, 2015, to April 11, 2017, 1098 participants were assessed for eligibility and 622 (57%) were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab (312 [50%]) or chemotherapy (310 [50%]). Median study follow-up was 31·4 months (IQR 27·8-34·4) for the pembrolizumab group and 31·5 months (27·8-34·6) for the chemotherapy group. Median overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more was 12·7 months (95% CI 9·9-16·3) for the pembrolizumab group and 11·6 months (8·3-13·7) for the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·78 [95% CI 0·57-1·06]; log-rank p=0·057). In participants with a CPS of 1 or more, median overall survival was 10·7 months (9·3-12·5) for the pembrolizumab group and 10·2 months (7·9-12·6) for the chemotherapy group (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·69-1·06]; log-rank p=0·073). In the overall population, median overall survival was 9·9 months (95% CI 8·3-11·4) for the pembrolizumab group and 10·8 months (9·1-12·6) for the chemotherapy group (HR 0·97 [95% CI 0·82-1·15]). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (three [1%] patients in the pembrolizumab group vs ten [3%] in the chemotherapy group), decreased white blood cells (one [<1%] vs 14 [5%]), decreased neutrophil count (one [<1%] vs 29 [10%]), and neutropenia (0 vs 39 [13%]). 61 (20%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 58 (20%) patients in the chemotherapy group had serious adverse events. Three (<1%) of 601 participants had treatment-related adverse events that led to death (one [<1%] in the pembrolizumab group due to circulatory collapse; two [1%] in the chemotherapy group, one [<1%] due to pancytopenia and sepsis and one [<1%] haemothorax).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer versus chemotherapy. These findings might inform future research of pembrolizumab monotherapy for selected subpopulations of patients, specifically those with PD-L1-enriched tumours, and inform a combinatorial approach for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "Patients were randomly assigned to six cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, with or without trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly until disease progression.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 186 patients received at least one dose of the study drug. Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was significantly superior to docetaxel alone in terms of overall response rate (61% v 34%; P = .0002), overall survival (median, 31.2 v 22.7 months; P = .0325), time to disease progression (median, 11.7 v 6.1 months; P = .0001), time to treatment failure (median, 9.8 v 5.3 months; P = .0001), and duration of response (median, 11.7 v 5.7 months; P = .009). There was little difference in the number and severity of adverse events between the arms. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was seen more commonly with the combination (32%) than with docetaxel alone (22%), and there was a slightly higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the combination arm (23% v 17%). One patient in the combination arm experienced symptomatic heart failure (1%). Another patient experienced symptomatic heart failure 5 months after discontinuation of trastuzumab because of disease progression, while being treated with an investigational anthracycline for 4 months.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Trastuzumab combined with docetaxel is superior to docetaxel alone as first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive MBC in terms of overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure, with little additional toxicity.",

        "es_title": "Global cancer statistics 2022: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.",
        "Background/Purpose": "This article presents global cancer statistics by world region for the year 2022 based on updated estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7%), followed by colorectal (9.3%), liver (7.8%), female breast (6.9%), and stomach (6.8%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.",

        "Background/Purpose": "This study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand antibody, with zoledronic acid (ZA) for delaying or preventing skeletal-related events (SRE) in patients with advanced cancer and bone metastases (excluding breast and prostate) or myeloma.",
        "Methods": "Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, double-dummy design to receive monthly subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg (n = 886) or intravenous ZA 4 mg (dose adjusted for renal impairment; n = 890). Daily supplemental calcium and vitamin D were strongly recommended. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression).",
        "Results/Findings": "Denosumab was noninferior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P = .0007). Although directionally favorable, denosumab was not statistically superior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (P = .03 unadjusted; P = .06 adjusted for multiplicity) or time to first-and-subsequent (multiple) SRE (rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04; P = .14). Overall survival and disease progression were similar between groups. Hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred at similarly low rates in both groups. Acute-phase reactions after the first dose occurred more frequently with ZA, as did renal adverse events and elevations in serum creatinine based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grading.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Denosumab was noninferior (trending to superiority) to ZA in preventing or delaying first on-study SRE in patients with advanced cancer metastatic to bone or myeloma. Denosumab represents a potential novel treatment option with the convenience of subcutaneous administration and no requirement for renal monitoring or dose adjustment.",

We now report the planned final overall survival (OS) results, and describe the most common adverse events (AEs) to better understand olaparib tolerability in this population.",
        "Methods": "OlympiAD, a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label study ( ), enrolled patients with a germline BRCAm and HER2-negative mBC who had received ≤2 lines of chemotherapy for mBC. Patients were randomized to olaparib tablets (300 mg bid) or predeclared TPC (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). OS and safety were secondary end points.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 205 patients were randomized to olaparib and 97 to TPC. At 64% data maturity, median OS was 19.3 months with olaparib versus 17.1 months with TPC (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66-1.23; P = 0.513); median follow-up was 25.3 and 26.3 months, respectively. HR for OS with olaparib versus TPC in prespecified subgroups were: prior chemotherapy for mBC [no (first-line setting): 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; yes (second/third-line): 1.13, 0.79-1.64]; receptor status (triple negative: 0.93, 0.62-1.43; hormone receptor positive: 0.86, 0.55-1.36); prior platinum (yes: 0.83, 0.49-1.45; no: 0.91, 0.64-1.33). Adverse events during olaparib treatment were generally low grade and manageable by supportive treatment or dose modification. There was a low rate of treatment discontinuation (4.9%), and the risk of developing anemia did not increase with extended olaparib exposure.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "While there was no statistically significant improvement in OS with olaparib compared to TPC, there was the possibility of meaningful OS benefit among patients who had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Olaparib was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity during extended exposure. Please see the article online for additional video content.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Cancer treatment should address female-specific survivorship issues, including the hypoestrogenic- related adverse effects of cancer therapies or of natural menopause in survivors. Systemic and vaginal estrogen are widely used for symptomatic relief of vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and lower urinary tract infections in the general population. However, given that some types of cancer are hormone sensitive, there are safety concerns about the use of local hormone therapy in women who currently have breast cancer or have a history of breast cancer. Nonhormonal approaches are the first-line choices for managing urogenital symptoms or atrophy-related urinary symptoms experienced by women during or after treatment for breast cancer. Among women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who are experiencing urogenital symptoms, vaginal estrogen should be reserved for those patients who are unresponsive to nonhormonal remedies. The decision to use vaginal estrogen may be made in coordination with a woman's oncologist. Additionally, it should be preceded by an informed decision-making and consent process in which the woman has the information and resources to consider the benefits and potential risks of low-dose vaginal estrogen. Data do not show an increased risk of cancer recurrence among women currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer or those with a personal history of breast cancer who use vaginal estrogen to relieve urogenital symptoms.",

        "Background/Purpose": "This study was a detailed microscopic analysis of the changes of vaginal microflora characteristics after application of 0.03 mg estriol-lactobacilli combination on the vaginal ecosystem in postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) survivors on aromatase inhibitors (AI) with severe atrophic vaginitis. A total of 16 BC women on AI applied daily one vaginal tablet of Gynoflor® for 28 days followed by a maintenance therapy of three tablets weekly for 8 weeks. During four follow up visits a smear from the upper lateral vaginal wall was analysed by phase contrast microscopy at 400 times magnification in order to classify the lactobacillary grades(LBG), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV), vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC), proportional number of leukocytes and evidence of parabasal cells and epitheliolysis. LBG improved from 81% LBG-III at entry to 88% LBG-I&IIa after 2 weeks of initial therapy, which further improved upon follow up (p < 0.001). Whereas BV was a rare event, AV was frequent and substantially improved during treatment (p < 0.01). While at entry most patients had moderate or severe AV, after maintenance therapy no patient except one had AV. The number of leukocytes dropped dramatically from a score of 1.78 ± 0.70 to 1.06 ± 0.25 which was consistent till the end of the study (p < 0.01). Parabasal cells dropped from a score of 3.4 ± 0.64 at entry to 1.3 ± 0.60 at the final visit (p trend < 0.01). Starting from a low rate of Candida colonisation of 2/14 (14%), a sudden rise to 7/16 (44%) occurred after 2 weeks, to return back to base levels at subsequent visits. The vaginal use of ultra-low dose estriol and lactobacilli results in rapid and enduring improvement of all markers of the vaginal microflora and epithelial vaginal cell quality in women with breast cancer on AI with dyspareunia. Candida may develop soon after its use, but rapidly disappears again upon their prolonged use. Due to its excellent safety profiles and clinical efficacy we recommend this product as first choice in women on AI with severe dyspareunia.",

        "es_title": "Is vaginal hyaluronic acid as effective as vaginal estriol for vaginal dryness relief?",
        "Background/Purpose": "In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel- group trial hyaluronic acid vaginal gel (Hyalofemme) was compared to estriol vaginal cream (Ovestin) in women with vaginal dryness due to various causes. A total of 144 supposedly postmenopausal women below age 70 years were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive hyaluronic acid vaginal gel (5 g per application) or estriol vaginal cream (0.5 g cream per application = 0.5 mg estriol) every 3 days for a total of ten applications, respectively. Exclusion criteria included vaginal infections, conventional contraindications to estrogens, use of vaginal products other than the investigational compounds, being unmarried, pregnant, or breastfeeding. The aim of the study was to test for non-inferiority of hyaluronic acid vaginal gel compared to estriol vaginal cream. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage (%) improvement in vaginal dryness, with the secondary end points being the percentage (%) improvements in vaginal itching, burning, and dyspareunia. Efficacy was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) (0-10; 0 = absent, 10 = intolerable) at baseline (V0), during telephone contact after the third administration (V1), and at the final visit after the tenth administration (V2). Safety parameters included vaginal pH, endometrial thickness, and a vaginal smear for vaginal microecosystem assessment. Adverse events were recorded according to international guidelines. 133 women completed the study. At baseline, participants' characteristics did not differ significantly. Mean age was 54 years, time since menopause was 5 years on average, and cause of menopause was mostly natural. However, mean menstrual cycle days were also reported, although according to inclusion criteria only postmenopausal women were eligible for the study. At V1, an improvement in vaginal dryness was reported by about 49 % of women using hyaluronic acid vaginal gel, and by 53 % of women using estriol vaginal cream (p = 0.31). At V2, the percentage improvement rates were 84 and 89 % (p = 0.13), respectively. Improvement rates for vaginal itching, burning, and dyspareunia at V2 were about 86, 85, and 57 % for hyaluronic acid vaginal gel, and 82, 87, and 62 % for estriol vaginal cream (p[0.05), respectively. After treatment, vaginal pH was significantly lower in estriol-treated women compared to those having received hyaluronic acid. Endometrial thickness did not differ between groups. In the majority of women, the vaginal microenvironment remained unaffected by treatment. However, the proportion of women whose abnormal vaginal microecological results became normal was higher in women using estriol vaginal cream.

        "Background/Purpose": "TAnDEM is the first randomized phase III study to combine a hormonal agent and trastuzumab without chemotherapy as treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/hormone receptor-copositive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women with HER2/hormone receptor-copositive MBC were randomly assigned to anastrozole (1 mg/d orally) with or without trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous infusion on day 1, then 2 mg/kg every week) until progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat population. Results Overall, 103 patients received trastuzumab plus anastrozole; 104 received anastrozole alone. Patients in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole arm experienced significant improvements in PFS compared with patients receiving anastrozole alone (hazard ratio = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84; median PFS, 4.8 v 2.4 months; log-rank P = .0016). In patients with centrally confirmed hormone receptor positivity (n = 150), median PFS was 5.6 and 3.8 months in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole and anastrozole alone arms, respectively (log-rank P = .006). Overall survival in the overall and centrally confirmed hormone receptor-positive populations showed no statistically significant treatment difference; however, 70% of patients in the anastrozole alone arm crossed over to receive trastuzumab after progression on anastrozole alone. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was 23% and 5%, respectively, in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole arm, and 15% and 1%, respectively, in the anastrozole alone arm; one patient in the combination arm experienced New York Heart Association class II congestive heart failure.",

        "es_title": "Amonafide: An active agent in the treatment of previously untreated advanced breast cancer--a cancer and leukemia group B study (CALGB 8642).",
        "Background/Purpose": "Amonafide is a new imide derivative of naphthalic acid. The drug had demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some activity in Phase I trials. The drug is extensively metabolized and detected in plasma and urine. Its toxicity has previously been correlated to the formation of an active metabolite, N-acetyl-amonafide. Amonafide was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) master metastatic breast cancer protocol. CALGB 8642 randomizes previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil, or to immediate treatment with standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil. The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival, toxicity, and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard chemotherapy. This report deals only with amonafide as a Phase II agent. Comparisons with the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil arm will not be addressed. Patients had to have histologically documented measurable breast cancer and a performance status of 0-1. Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was permitted. Patients could not have visceral crisis. Amonafide was given at 300 mg/m2/day i.v. for 5 days, and repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles. Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof. Toxicity was primarily hematological and bimodal: 32% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia; 22% had no leukopenia and 44% had no thrombocytopenia. The response rate was 18%, including one complete response. When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity, there was a 35.7% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 (versus 8.3%, P = 0.08). There was a 50% response if patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 (versus 7.1%, P = <0.01). We conclude that amonafide is somewhat active in previously untreated breast cancer patients. There may be a steep dose-response curve, based on the significant correlation between myelosuppression and response. Rates of responses in patients adequately dosed (i.e., with significant hematotoxicity) with amonafide ranged from 35 to 50%. Further studies will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator phenotyping.",

        "es_title": "Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.",
        "Background/Purpose": "Locally advanced breast cancer encompasses a heterogeneous collection of breast neoplasms and constitutes approximately 10%-20% of the newly diagnosed breast cancers. These cancers may have widely different clinical and biological characteristics. Patients with these tumors may be classified as stage IIB, III or IV breast cancer according to the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and End Results Reporting (TNM classification). Multidisciplinary therapy has become the treatment of choice for these patients. Primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by locoregional therapy, either surgery and/or radiotherapy, and postoperative systemic chemotherapy is now an accepted strategy. More than 70% of patients achieve an objective response (including pathological complete remission in 10%-25% of cases), and many patients experience downstaging through primary chemotherapy. Breast conservation is possible in 10%-40% of patients with locally advanced breast cancer; almost all patients initially are rendered disease-free, and long-term local control is achieved in over 70% of these patients. Primary chemotherapy is the initial choice of treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors, but it is unclear what the optimal sequence of subsequent therapies should be, whether one or two local treatment modalities are necessary, and whether any or different postoperative chemotherapy is needed. The efficacy of primary chemotherapy was demonstrated in several large prospective studies in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The natural history of this disease was changed dramatically by the introduction of these combined modality therapies. Five-year disease-free survival rates of 35%-70% are commonly reported, and about 25%-40% of patients will survive beyond 10 years without recurrence. In summary, multidisciplinary therapy that includes primary chemotherapy provides appropriate local control and the possibility of breast conservation therapy; it increases surgical resectability and survival rates in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The role of new innovative therapeutic strategies such as high-dose chemotherapy, with hematopoietic stem cell rescue, new cytotoxic agents and higher dose-intensity therapy is currently under evaluation in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.",

The mPFS (70% CI) in ARM 1 was 23 mo (18, 29) and 19.5 mo (17, 36) in ARM 2; 24 and 36-mo PFS (70% CI) for ARM 1 were 45.7% (38.9, 52.5) and 32.8% (26.0, 39.5) compared with 46.8 (39.2, 54.3) and 38.1 (29.7, 46.6) in ARM 2; HR (70% CI): 0.92 (0.71, 1.17); and 1-sided log-rank p = 0.36. As PFS did not show signal, OS reporting is included: median OS was not reached in either arm; 36-mo OS (95% CI) in ARM 1 71.8% (58.9, 84.7) and ARM 2 68.9% (55.1, 82.6; 2-sided log-rank p = 0.54). Analysis of first failure showed new mets outside index area (Arm 1) /RT field (Arm 2) developed similarly in both arms at 40%. There were fewer new mets inside treated/index area for Arm 2 6.7% vs ARM 1 29.2%, respectively. There were no grade 5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), 1 grade 4 AE in ARM 1, and 9.7% and 5.3% grade 3 AEs in ARMS 1 and 2, respectively. Circulating tumor cell counts (0 vs ≥1) at baseline were similar in both arms and were not prognostic HR (95% CI): 1.04 (0.54, 2.02).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of MDT to SOC ST did not show signal for improved PFS, nor OS difference in patients with OMBC. The trial will not proceed to the Phase III component.",

        "Background/Purpose": "OVERSTEP is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of capecitabine (CAP) versus endocrine therapy (HT) as maintenance therapy after 1st-line CAP-based combination chemotherapy in HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC. At 2020 SABCS conference, we have reported the primary endpoint (progression-free survival, PFS) of the OVERSTEP (NCT02597868) trial. With a median follow-up of 24.3 months,Median PFS (mPFS) of HT cohort was significantly longer than that of CAP group (17.5 months vs. 12.2 months, HR=0.625, 95%CI: 0.429-0.909, P=0.013). In this annual meeting, we will report the update of mPFS and the secondary endpoint (overall survival, OS).",
        "Methods": "HR+ and HER2- metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients were histologically confirmed and received at least 4 cycles of CAP-based combination regimen as 1st-line salvage chemotherapy. The patients who achieved CR, PR or durable SD by RECIST criteria entered into the maintenance therapy setting (MT), and randomly (1:1 ratio) assigned to either CAP single or HT group. Randomization was done centrally with stratification by endocrine sensitive or resistance and visceral or non-visceral metastasis. The primary endpoint was mPFS, and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), safety, et al. The superiority test was performed in all patients who received at least one dose maintenance therapy. The last follow-up ended in June 30, 2021. The medium follow-up duration was 41.4 months and the OS event was mature.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 181 eligible patients were enrolled in this study from Jun 5, 2013 to Jan 14, 2019. After combined chemotherapy, 75.14% (n=136) cases entered into the maintenance therapy setting, and 24.86% case were disease progressed (PD) during combined chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 41.4 months (IQR 21.57-79.23), the update mPFS in HT group remained superior to CAP cohort (17.7 months vs. 12.2 months, P=0.011). In addition, the median maintenance duration of HT group was significantly longer than that of CAP group (13.8 months vs. 7.4 months, P= 0.008). For endocrine sensitive patients, mPFS was greatly prolonged in HT group compared to CAP cohort (29.3 months vs. 14.8 months, HR=0.515, 95%CI: 0.269-0.988, P=0.042). Besides, in non-visceral metastasis patients, median PFS of HT group was 25.3 months which was longer than CAP subgroup 17.0 months (HR=0.54, 95%CI: 0.300-0.972, P=0.037). However, in endocrine resistance patients, there was no significant difference between HT and CAP group (13.6 months vs. 12.0 months, HR=0.791, 95%CI: 0.499-1.253, P=0.314). There was no difference observed between HT and CAP group in visceral involved cases (14.3 months vs. 11.0 months, HR= 0.668, 95%CI: 0.410-1.089, P=0.101). The median OS was 51.7 months (95%CI: 36.614-66.786) in HT cohort and 39.8 months (95%CI:14.083-65.517) in CAP group, respectively (HR=0.882, 95%CI: 0.550-1.414, P=0.600).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For HR+ and HER2- MBC, after 1st-line salvage combined chemotherapy, HT maintenance therapy demonstrated sustained better survival benefits than CAP, especially for hormone sensitive or non-visceral involved patients. The primary endpoint of this study was successfully reached and the median OS was prolonged by 11.9-months.",

The objective of this study was to assess practices in this setting in a university medical oncology department.",
        "Methods": "This retrospective study included all patients who were managed for luminal mBC between January 2013 and April 2016. The analysis focused on the characteristics of the patients, the modalities of cancer treatment and delays between visceral crisis and death.",
        "Results/Findings": "Thirty-five patients pre-treated with two hormonal therapy lines were enrolled retrospectively. Worse performance status and a higher proportion of severe organ dysfunction for luminal mBC were observed among patients with visceral crisis. Sixty-five percent of patients received cytotoxic treatment. One cycle of chemotherapy was administrated in the majority of patients. Palliative care was performed in 35% of patients. Chemotherapy did not have any significant effect on patient outcome in the present study. The mean time between visceral crisis and death was 4.7 weeks (standard deviation = 1.9).",

MONARCH 3 is a randomized, phase III, double-blind study of abemaciclib/placebo (150 mg twice daily, continuous) plus nonsteroidal AI (1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily). A total of 493 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC with no prior systemic therapy in this setting were enrolled. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS (final analysis after 240 events); other endpoints included response and safety evaluations.

        "Background/Purpose": "The Phase 2 PARSIFAL study assessed whether fulvestrant (FUL) or letrozole (LET) was the optimal endocrine partner for the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) palbociclib (PAL) in patients (pts) with untreated, endocrine-sensitive, hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in the first-line setting. This trial failed to demonstrate an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of PAL+FUL over PAL+LET (Llombart-Cussac et al. Jama Oncol 2021). Following progression on CDK4/6i-based regimens in the metastatic setting, the EMERALD study (Bardia et al, SABCS 2022 GS3-01) identified early progressions (< 12 months [mo]) as a strong predictor of resistance to subsequent endocrine therapies. Here, we report updated PFS and overall survival (OS) from PARSIFAL, exploring a PFS <12 mo threshold as a prognostic factor for poor outcomes.",
        "Methods": "This was an observational, international, multicenter study that included pts from the prospective PARSIFAL study, in which pts were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PAL (oral 125 mg/day, 28-day cycles; 3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus FUL or LET at conventional doses. The primary objective was to extend the assessment of OS of PARSIFAL study with a longer median follow-up. Secondary objectives included extended PFS, other post-progression efficacy data, and the identification of new prognostic and predictive markers. The design had a planned recruitment of at least 388 pts with 195 deaths. The 2-sided stratified log-rank test (α = 0.05) had a 70% power to detect a hazard ratio ≤0.70 in favor of FUL + PAL arm.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 389 pts (80.5%) from the PARSIFAL study were included in this analysis, involving 32 of the 47 original sites. Pts signed a new informed consent form according to local regulations. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the PARSIFAL-LONG and the overall PARISFAL intention-to-treat populations. At the time of analysis, after a median follow up of 5.0 years (range, 0.1-7.3), 241 and 213 events were reported for PFS and OS, respectively. No differences in efficacy were observed between treatment arms whether for PFS (hazard ratio, 1.0, p=0.985) or OS (hazard ratio, 0.94, p=0.635). In accordance with the protocol for PARSIFAL-LONG, both arms were combined for subsequent analysis. The median PFS (mPFS) for the first-line PAL-based regimen population was 33.2 mo (95%CI, 27.7-39.5), with a median OS (mOS) of 65.4 mo (95%CI, 57.8-72.0). A total of 86 pts (22.1% of the population) had a mPFS time <12 mo (early progressors). mOS and mPFS for this early progressor subgroup were 24.0 mo (95%CI, 17.3-30.1) and 7.0 mo (95%CI, 5.6-8.3), respectively, and only 11 pts (12.8%) were still alive at the time of analysis. The remaining 303 pts (77.9%) were progression-free on PAL-based regimens at 12 mo (PFS≥12). The number of events for PFS and OS at this time were 165 (54.5%) and 138 (45.5%), respectively. mOS from randomization for the PFS≥12 subgroup was 81.5 mo (95%CI, 70.2-not achieved) and the mPFS was 49.8 mo (95%CI, 40.9-59.8). Following progression on PAL-based regimens, the PFS≥12 criteria was a strong predictor for mOS, with 27.0 vs 18.0 mo (hazard ratio, 0.67, 95%CI, 0.51-0.90, p=0.007) for PFS≥12 and early progressors, respectively. These differences may increase in the future, as 54.5% of pts with PFS≥12 are still alive compared to 12.8% of pts with an early progression.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Extended follow-up analysis from PARSIFAL study confirms no major differences between LET or FUL when combined with PAL. mPFS and mOS results are consistent with those reported in other first-line trials involving different CDK4/6i. Progression within the first year of first-line CDK4/6i-based regimen for HR+/HER2- ABC pts may be prognostic of less favorable outcomes.",

Key AEs were mostly G1–2 and had resolved (Table). No key AEs were G4–5. In the Inavo arm, among pts who experienced key AEs (HG, diarrhea, rash, stomatitis), median time to first onset was 7, 15, 29, and 13 days, respectively. The key AEs were managed with standard supportive care and Inavo dose interruptions/reductions. One pt discontinued Inavo due to HG; one, due to stomatitis. Pts receiving Inavo experienced a longer duration of time without worsening pain severity and maintained their day-to-day functioning and health-related quality of life on tx.

        "Results/Findings": "At the data cutoff (Oct 30, 2020), the median follow-up was 56.3 mo (min, 52.7 mo) and 68 (14.0%) and 21 (8.7%) patients were still on treatment in the RIB vs PBO arms, respectively. With this extended follow-up, RIB + FUL continued to demonstrate an OS benefit vs PBO + FUL (median, 53.7 vs 41.5 mo; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90).

The final protocol-specified OS analysis, which was conducted with a median follow-up of 44.8 months (mo), showed improved OS with PAL+FUL vs PBO+FUL (median OS, 34.9 vs 28.0 mo; hazard ratio, 0.814 [95% CI, 0.644–1.029]; 1-sided P=0.0429). Here, we report the results from an OS analysis with a longer median follow-up of 73.3 mo.",
        "Methods": "A total of 521 patients (pts) with HR+/HER2– ABC who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy were randomized 2:1 to PAL (125 mg/d orally, 3/1 week schedule) + FUL (500 mg intramuscular injection) or PBO+FUL. Investigator-assessed PFS was the primary endpoint; OS was a key secondary endpoint. An ad hoc OS analysis was performed when 393 events (75% of the total population) were observed.

The 5-year OS rate was 23.3% (95% CI, 18.7–28.2) with PAL+FUL and 16.8% (95% CI, 11.2–23.3) with PBO+FUL. Favorable OS with PAL+FUL vs PBO+FUL was observed in most subgroups except among pts who were endocrine resistant or had prior chemotherapy for ABC. No new safety signals were identified. Eighteen pts remain on study treatment, including 15 (4.3%) on PAL+FUL and 3 (1.7%) on PBO+FUL. A post-study cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor was received by 20 pts (7.5%) in the PAL+FUL arm and 32 pts (22.2%) in the PBO+FUL arm. ctDNA analyses of tumor mutation profiles (ie, ESR1, PIK3CA, RB1) at the end of treatment and their effect on OS will also be presented.",

While disease progression occurs in nearly all patients (pts) with ABC, the optimal treatment for pts who experience progression on a CDK4/6i + ET remains uncertain. Real-world evidence suggests that use of abemaciclib after disease progression on a prior CDK4/6i prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) in ABC; however, Phase 2 trials with other CDK4/6i have generated mixed results. Here we present the primary outcome analysis for the Phase 3 postMONARCH trial (NCT05169567) of fulvestrant + abemaciclib or placebo in pts with HR+, HER2- ABC following disease progression on prior CDK4/6i + ET.",

No other prior treatment for ABC was permitted. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS; secondary endpoints included PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7, the study had ~80% power to detect superiority for abemaciclib, with a cumulative 2-sided type I error of 0.05. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS curves and treatment effect was estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 368 pts were randomized to abemaciclib + fulvestrant (n = 182) or placebo + fulvestrant (n= 186). Most pts (99%) enrolled directly after CDK4/6i + ET as initial therapy for ABC. Prior CDK4/6i was 59% palbociclib, 33% ribociclib, and 8% abemaciclib. At interim analysis, the study reached the pre-specified criteria for significantly improved investigator-assessed PFS with abemaciclib + fulvestrant compared to placebo + fulvestrant (169 events, HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.48 – 0.91; p = 0.01). At primary analysis (258 events), the HR was 0.73 (95% CI 0.57 – 0.95), with PFS rates at 6 months of 50% vs 37% for the abemaciclib and placebo arms, respectively. Consistent effect was seen across major clinical and genomic subgroups, including pts with baseline ESR1 or PIK3CA mutations. ORR was improved with abemaciclib compared to placebo (17% vs 7%, respectively, in pts with measurable disease). PFS according to BICR was also improved with HR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.39 - 0.77).

At data cutoff (Apr 12, 2022), median follow-up was 24.1 mo; 45.5% and 23.6% of pts remained on treatment in the RIB + ET arm and combination CT arm, respectively. The primary endpoint was met, with a statistically significant PFS benefit of ≈1 year for RIB + ET vs combination CT (mPFS, 24.0 vs 12.3 mo; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.79; P=.0007). OS data were immature at data cutoff. The mTTF was ≈10 mo longer for RIB + ET vs CT (18.6 vs 8.5 mo; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32-0.63). The ORR was similar for RIB + ET vs CT (65.2% vs 60.0%). No new safety signals were observed in pts on RIB. Lower rates of treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs; 1.8% vs 8.0%) and lower rates of discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs (7.1% vs 23.0%) were seen with RIB + ET vs CT, respectively. AEs observed with combination CT were consistent with the published data.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This analysis demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit with RIB + ET over combination CT in the first-line pre/perimenopausal pt population with aggressive HR+/HER2− ABC disease. This is the first study comparing a CDK4/6i + ET vs combination CT and demonstrating the superiority of RIB + ET in aggressive HR+/HER2− ABC. This evidence supports RIB+ ET use as a preferred option for this pt population.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Pyrotinib (an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting EGFR, HER2 and HER4) plus capecitabine significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with that for lapatinib plus capecitabine in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after treatment with trastuzumab and taxanes in the interim analysis of the PHOEBE trial (NCT03080805; Xu et al. Lancet Oncology, 2021). In this report, we present an updated analysis of the overall survival data from this trial.",
        "Methods": "This PHOEBE trial enrolled patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received prior trastuzumab and taxanes and up to two prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral pyrotinib 400 mg or lapatinib 1250 mg once daily, combined with oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m² twice daily on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Stratification factors were hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]- and/or progesterone receptor [PR]-positive vs. ER- and PR-negative) and previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (≤1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by masked independent central review. Data cutoff for the updated overall survival analysis was March 31, 2021.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between July 31, 2017 and October 30, 2018, 267 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized to either pyrotinib plus capecitabine (pyrotinib group) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (lapatinib group). 134 patients in pyrotinib group and 132 in lapatinib group started the assigned treatment. At data cutoff, the median follow-up duration was 33.2 months (95% CI 31.4-34.2) in the pyrotinib group and 31.8 months (95% CI 31.2-34.1) in the lapatinib group. 78 (58.2%) patients in the pyrotinib group and 98 (74.2%) patients in the lapatinib group received post-discontinuation therapy, with trastuzumab (60 [44.8%] in the pyrotinib group and 65 [49.2%] in the lapatinib group) being the most common. As of data cutoff date, 54 (40.3%) of 134 patients randomly assigned to the pyrotinib group and 69 (52.3%) of the 132 patients randomly assigned to lapatinib group had died. Median OS was not reached (95% CI 34.0-not reached) in the pyrotinib group and 26.9 months (22.4-not reached) in the lapatinib group (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.48-0.98]; P=0.019). Kaplan-Meier estimated OS at 24 months was 66.6% (95% CI 57.7-74.0) and 58.8% (95% CI 49.7-66.7), respectively. 99 (73.9%) patients in the pyrotinib group and 121 (91.7%) in the lapatinib group had disease progression or had died. Pyrotinib plus capecitabine significantly improved PFS assessed by investigator compared with that for lapatinib plus capecitabine (12.5 months [95% CI 9.8-13.8] vs 5.6 months [95% CI 5.5-7.0]; HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.37-0.63]; P<0.0001). The benefits of pyrotinib plus capecitabine were observed in most clinically relevant subgroups for the updated analysis of both OS and PFS (Table 1).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With extended follow-up, pyrotinib plus capecitabine demonstrated statistically significant OS improvement compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after trastuzumab and chemotherapy. This updated analysis of overall survival in the PHOEBE trial reaffirmed pyrotinib plus capecitabine as an established treatment option in this patient population.",

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate approved to treat HER2+ LA/MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. This is the first report of HER2CLIMB-02 (NCT03975647), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of tucatinib combined with T-DM1 in patients with previously treated HER2+ LA/MBC.",
        "Methods": "Eligible patients had HER2+ LA/MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane in any setting with ECOG performance status ≤1 and adequate hepatic, renal, hematologic, and cardiac function. Patients with previously treated stable, progressing, or untreated brain metastases (BMs) not requiring immediate local therapy were also eligible. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 21-day cycles of either tucatinib (300 mg orally twice a day [PO BID]) or placebo (PO BID), combined with T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1. Alpha-controlled secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 for the overall population, and PFS and OS for the subset of patients with BMs at baseline. Safety was analyzed as a secondary endpoint.",
        "Results/Findings": "From October 8, 2019, to June 16, 2022, 463 patients were randomly assigned, comprising 228 to the tucatinib arm (tucatinib + T-DM1) and 235 to the control arm (placebo + T-DM1). The median duration of follow-up (OS) was 24.4 months for the overall population. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 arms. Almost half (44.1%) of the overall population had either active or stable BMs at baseline. As of the data cutoff (June 29, 2023), the study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the tucatinib arm vs control arm. The risk of progression or death decreased by 24.1% in the tucatinib arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.759 [95% CI, 0.607-0.950]; P=0.0163). Median PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.4-10.9) vs 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.6-8.1) for the tucatinib and control arms, respectively. HRs for PFS across all prespecified subgroups were consistent with the HR of the overall population, including patients with BMs at baseline (HR=0.639 [95% CI, 0.459-0.891]). The interim OS results were immature with 134 of 253 total required events (53%) and did not meet the prespecified crossing boundary. The confirmed ORR was numerically higher in the tucatinib arm (42.0%) vs the control arm (36.1%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included nausea (65.4% vs 49.4% for tucatinib and control arms, respectively), diarrhea (56.7% vs 26.6%), and fatigue (48.9% vs 37.3%). The most common grade ≥3 TEAEs in the tucatinib arm were alanine and aspartate aminotransferase elevations, each reported in 38 patients (16.5%) in the tucatinib arm and 6 patients (2.6%) in the control arm. TEAEs associated with any treatment discontinuation occurred in 51 patients (22.1%) in the tucatinib arm and 27 (11.6%) in the control arm. TEAEs leading to deaths occurred in 3 patients (1.3%) in the tucatinib arm and 2 patients (0.9%) in the control arm.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "HER2CLIMB-02 demonstrated that the addition of tucatinib to T-DM1 significantly improved median PFS in patients with previously treated HER2+ LA/MBC, including those with BMs. Although discontinuations due to TEAEs were more common in the tucatinib arm, no new safety signals emerged for the combination therapy.",

There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the CPS ≥1 population, and statistical significance was not tested in the ITT population due to the prespecified testing strategy. Here, we compare outcomes in subgroups of patients by additional CPS cut-offs to the primary results of KEYNOTE-355.",
        "Methods": "847 patients with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, ECOG PS 0-1, and ≥6 month disease-free interval were randomized 2:1 to pembro + chemo (nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days; paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days; or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days) or placebo + chemo for up to 35 administrations of pembro/placebo or until progression/intolerable toxicity. Patients were stratified by chemo type (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 status (CPS ≥1 or <1), and prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment with same-class chemo (yes or no). Dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS (RECIST v1.1, blinded independent central review) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (CPS ≥10 and ≥1) and in the ITT population. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs in the additional CPS subgroups were based on an unstratified Cox model.",
        "Results/Findings": "At the time of the final analysis (data cutoff, June 15, 2021), the median time from randomization to data cutoff was 44 months. Baseline characteristics of the CPS 1-9, 10-19, and ≥20 subgroups were generally similar to those of the ITT population.

        "Background/Purpose": "TROP2 (trophoblast cell surface antigen 2) is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with worse survival. Sacituzumab tirumotecan (SKB264/MK-2870) is a TROP2 ADC developed with a novel linker to conjugate the payload, a belotecan-derivative topoisomerase I inhibitor with a drug-to-antibody-ratio (DAR) of 7.4. The hydrolytically linker permits both extracellular pH-sensitive cleavage and intracellular enzymatic cleavage to release the membrane permeable payload enabling the “bystander effect”. Here, we report the results from a phase Ⅲ study of sacituzumab tirumotecan in pts with advanced TNBC (OptiTROP-Breast01, NCT05347134).",
        "Methods": "In this randomized phase Ⅲ trial, SKB264 was compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine) in pts with locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC who had received two or more prior therapies including at least one for metastatic setting. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR). The TROP2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the semi-quantitative H-score method.",
        "Results/Findings": "Pts were randomly assigned to receive SKB264 (n = 130) or chemotherapy (n = 133). The median age was 51 years; 87% had visceral metastases; 26% received prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; 48% received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The primary endpoint of PFS was met based on interim analysis (data cutoff: Jun 21, 2023) with a 69% reduction in risk of progression or death (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.45; P <0.00001). The median PFS assessed by BICR was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.2) with SKB264 and 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.7) with chemotherapy; PFS at 6 months was 43.4% vs 11.1%. In the subset of pts with TROP2 H-score > 200, the median PFS was 5.8 months with SKB264 and 1.9 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.48). At the first planned interim analysis for overall survival (OS) (data cutoff: Nov 30, 2023) with median follow-up of 10.4 months, OS was statistically significant in favor of SKB264 (HR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.78; P =0.0005); the median OS was not reached (95% CI, 11.2 to NE) with SKB264 and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.5 to 11.7) with chemotherapy. The objective response rate assessed by BICR was 43.8% with SKB264 and 12.8% with chemotherapy. Most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (SKB264 vs chemotherapy) were neutrophil count decreased (32.3% vs 47.0%), anemia (27.7% vs 6.1%) and white blood cell count decreased (25.4% vs 36.4%).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Background. Randomized studies have shown different magnitude of bevacizumab benefit in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Regulatory agencies have modified bevacizumab treatment indications across different regions. In this study, we perform a meta-analysis of phase III studies aiming to interrogate the magnitude of bevacizumab benefit for the treatment of first-line HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods. Data from studies E2100, AVADO and RIBBON-1 were used to calculate the benefit of bevacizumab in terms of tumor overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities. Combined statistical estimates of hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios were calculated using fixed-effects or random-effects models. Results. A total of 2,695 patients were evaluated. Combining bevacizumab with different chemotherapy backbones resulted in a 30% risk reduction of PFS events (HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.86) and increased ORR (odds ratio 1.81; 95% CI, 1.53-2.14). No OS benefit could be demonstrated (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85-1.06). Bevacizumab significantly increased the incidence of adverse events such as proteinuria, hypertension and cardiovascular events. Conclusions. Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of MBC significantly improved ORR and PFS, but also increased grade 3-4 toxicities. No significant OS advantage was observed.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Bone metastasis is a common complication of many types of advanced cancer, including breast cancer. Bone metastasis may cause severe pain, fractures, and hypercalcemia, rendering clinical management challenging and substantially reducing the quality of life and overall survival (OS) time of breast cancer patients. Studies have revealed that bone metastasis is related to interactions between tumor cells and the bone microenvironment, and involves complex molecular biological mechanisms, including colonization, osteolytic destruction, and an immunosuppressive bone microenvironment. Agents inhibiting bone metastasis (such as bisphosphate and denosumab) alleviate bone destruction and improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients with bone metastasis. However, the prognosis of these patients remains poor, and the specific biological mechanism of bone metastasis is incompletely understood. Additional basic and clinical studies are urgently needed, to further explore the mechanism of bone metastasis and develop new therapeutic drugs. This review presents a summary of the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of bone metastasis of breast cancer, aiming to improve the quality of life and prognosis of breast cancer patients and provide a reference for future research directions.",

ZN-1041 is a best-in-class HER2 inhibitor designed to be delivered across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with high selectivity and broader safety margin to treat HER2+ BCBM.",
        "Methods": "Brain penetration of ZN-1041 and other approved HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were evaluated. Anti-tumor activity of ZN-1041 alone or in combination were evaluated in xenograft models. ZN-A-1041-101 (NCT04487236) is an on-going phase 1, multicenter, open-label study. The study comprises first-in-human dose escalation of ZN-1041 monotherapy (phase 1a) in HER2+ solid tumor patients (pts) with or without BM, dose escalation (phase 1b) and expansion (phase 1c) of ZN-1041 in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in pts with HER2+ BCBM (including active BM). The primary objective was safety and tolerability. The secondary objective includes pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor response including ORR per RECIST 1.1 and intracranial ORR (iORR) per RANO-BM.",
        "Results/Findings": "Unlike currently approved HER2 TKIs which are strong human efflux transporter P-gp and BCRP substrates, ZN-1041 is not a substrate of either and has high BBB permeability, therefore predicted to have good BBB penetration. ZN-1041 alone demonstrated dose-dependent and significant anti-tumor activity when compared to tucatinib in BM model. ZN-1041 could synergize with capecitabine and trastuzumab to demonstrate significantly improved intracranial efficacy in BM models, while maintaining good tolerability. In total, 21 HER2+ mBC pts were enrolled to complete phase 1a and 1b. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related SAE were observed across all dose levels. PK exposure was increased with dose escalation and Kpuu,CSF of ZN-1041 was 4.9. In ZN-1041 monotherapy, the overall ORR and iORR were 50% in TKI naïve, unequivocal HER2+ pts. The longest treatment duration was 15 months. As of data cutoff (Dec 02, 2022), totally 35 TKI naïve, HER2+ BCBM pts with median 2L treatments were enrolled for phase 1c and all pts were well tolerated to date. Adverse reactions of grade 3 or higher (≥5%) were hepatic function impairment (8.7%), headache (8.7%), hyperbilirubinemia (5.7%), ALT increased (5.7%), AST increased (5.7%), GGT increased (5.7%) and WBC decreased (5.7%). Among 19 BCBM pts with at least twice tumor assessment, the overall ORR was 78.9% (95% CI: 54.4–93.9) and iORR was 73.7% (95% CI: 48.8–90.9), DCR was 100%. In addition, 6 pts completed first tumor assessment and 5 achieved PR and 1 had SD per RECISIT 1.1.",

The majority of patients with MaBC present with painless lumps, and about half of the patients have at least one lymph node involved at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of MaBC models that of female breast cancer (FeBC), but this is mainly due to lack of prospective studies for MaBC patients. The treatment modality includes surgery, adjuvant radiation, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. However, there are some distinct features of MaBC, both clinically and molecularly, that may warrant a different clinical approach.

        "es_title": "HER2-positive male breast cancer: an update.",
        "Background/Purpose": "Although rare, male breast cancer (MBC) remains a substantial cause for morbidity and mortality in men. Based on age frequency distribution, age-specific incidence rate pattern, and prognostic factor profiles, MBC is considered similar to postmenopausal breast cancer (BC). Compared with female BC (FBC), MBC cases are more often hormonal receptor (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor [ER/PR]) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative. Treatment of MBC patients follows the same indications as female postmenopausal with surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy. To date, ER/PR and HER2 status provides baseline predictive information used in selecting optimal adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy and in the selection of therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. HER2 represents a very interesting molecular target and a number of compounds (trastuzumab [Herceptin®; F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland] and lapatinib [Tykerb®, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK]) are currently under clinical evaluation. Particularly, trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody which selectively binds the extracellular domain of HER2, has become an important therapeutic agent for women with HER2-positive (HER2+) BC. Currently, data regarding the use of trastuzumab in MBC patients is limited and only few case reports exist. In all cases, MBC patients received trastuzumab concomitantly with other drugs and no severe toxicity above grade 3 was observed. However, MBC patients that would be candidate for trastuzumab therapy (ie, HER2+/ER+ or HER2+/ER- MBCs) represent only a very small percentage of MBC cases. This is noteworthy, when taking into account that trastuzumab is an important and expensive component of systemic BC therapy. Since there is no data supporting the fact that response to therapy is different for men or women, we concluded that systemic therapy in MBC should be considered on the same basis as for FBC. Particularly in male patients, trastuzumab should be considered exclusively for advanced disease or high-risk HER2+ early BCs. On the other hand, lapatinib (Tykerb), a novel oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, may represent an interesting and promising therapeutic agent for trastuzumab-resistant MBC patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "近年来，随着对乳腺癌筛查的重视与规范化诊疗技术的提升，中国乳腺癌患者治愈率显著提高，患者生存时间显著延长。伴随乳腺癌患者随诊随访期的延长，患者面临的肿瘤及相关其他健康问题也逐渐增加，需要制定更为精准而长远的随诊随访计划，关注更广泛的健康风险。抗肿瘤治疗、年龄、激素水平变化等因素导致的乳腺癌患者心血管、骨健康、心理健康等问题，已成为乳腺癌患者管理的新难题，其不仅影响患者的生活质量，甚至转化为疾病复发和死亡风险。因此，除了落实规范化治疗外，患者科学规范的随诊随访、伴随疾病的全方位管理、跨学科协作、全面康复也是乳腺癌治疗的关键环节，这对于提高患者的治疗效果，提升患者健康水平和生活质量均有重大意义。基于当前中国乳腺癌患者的治疗及随诊随访现状，根据文献及指南，结合跨学科专家诊疗建议，在2019版《乳腺癌随访及伴随疾病全方位管理指南》基础上进行更新，修订2022版《中国乳腺癌随诊随访与健康管理指南》，包括随诊随访路径图、随诊随访管理、全方位健康管理以及患者报告结局四大部分，旨在规范乳腺癌患者的长期随诊随访，指导临床医师积极开展乳腺癌患者全方位跨学科健康管理，从而进一步提高中国乳腺癌患者预后与生活质量。",

        "Background/Purpose": "Hot flashes (HFs) negatively affect quality of life among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. This study investigated the efficacy of oxybutynin vs placebo in decreasing HFs.",
        "Methods": "In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind study, women with and without breast cancer with 28 or more HFs per week, lasting longer than 30 days, who were not candidates for estrogen-based therapy, were assigned to oral oxybutynin (2.5 mg twice a day or 5 mg twice a day) or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the intrapatient change from baseline in weekly HF score between each oxybutynin dose and placebo using a repeated-measures mixed model. Secondary endpoints included changes in weekly HF frequency, HF-related daily interference scale questionnaires, and self-reported symptoms.",
        "Results/Findings": "We enrolled 150 women. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Mean (SD) age was 57 (8.2) years. Two-thirds (65%) were taking tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Patients on both oxybutynin doses reported greater reductions in the weekly HF score (5 mg twice a day: -16.9 [SD 15.6], 2.5 mg twice a day: -10.6 [SD 7.7]), placebo -5.7 (SD 10.2);   < .005 for both oxybutynin doses vs placebo), HF frequency (5 mg twice a day: -7.5 [SD 6.6], 2.5 mg twice a day: -4.8 [SD 3.2], placebo: -2.6 [SD 4.3];   < .003 for both oxybutynin doses vs placebo), and improvement in most HF-related daily interference scale measures and in overall quality of life. Patients on both oxybutynin arms reported more side effects than patients on placebo, particularly dry mouth, difficulty urinating, and abdominal pain. Most side effects were grade 1 or 2. There were no differences in study discontinuation because of adverse effects.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Oxybutynin is an effective and relatively well-tolerated treatment option for women with HFs.",
