        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "The Mayo Mammography Health Study cohort enrolled 19,924 women having a screening mammogram (mgm) at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, between 2003 and 2006. Participants were 35 years and older, had no prior breast cancer and lived in the tri-state area (MN, IA and WI). Risk factor data were collected through self-administered questionnaire and clinic databases. Incident breast cancers were identified through tumor registries (Mayo Clinic, MN, IA, WI). The BI-RADS, 4-category clinical density measure (fatty, scattered density, heterogeneous density and extreme density) was available on all mgms performed after 1996. A case-cohort design consisting of incident cases (n=241) and a random selection of the cohort (n=2300, 28 developed cancer) was used to examine the association between change in BI-RADS density and breast cancer. BI-RADS densities measured from the earliest available, and enrollment mgms (average 6 years apart) were used to assess density change. Proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) associated with a change in one or more BI-RADS density categories over time, relative to staying within the same category. Age was used as the time scale, and the subcohort was weighted by the inverse of the sampling proportion. Analyses were adjusted for age, years between mgms, BI-RADS density at earliest mgm, and changes in BMI, postmenopausal hormone use, and menopausal status.",
        "Results/Findings": "Longitudinal analyses were conducted on the 219 cases and 1900 non-cases in the subcohort with at least one mgm available prior to enrollment mgm. Compared to the subcohort, cases were older (56.8 vs. 52.9 years), more likely postmenopausal (73.4% vs. 61.6%), had higher BMI (29.0 vs 28.1) and were more frequently screened (8.0 vs. 6.9 pre-enrollment mgms). As expected, cases were more likely to have extreme density (BI-RADS=4) at earliest mgm than non-cases (16.2% vs 14.3%). Cases were less likely than non-cases to experience a reduction of one density category or more (37.0% vs 38.6%) following earliest mgm. Adjusting for potential confounders, women who decreased one BI-RADS category or more over an average 6 years were at reduced risk of breast cancer (HR=0.72, 95%CI: 0.50-0.99) compared to those whose density was unchanged. However, women who increased one or more BI-RADS categories had suggestion of increased risk (HR=1.52, 95%CI: 0.97-2.4).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Women with a decrease in BI-RADS density category over 6 years may have decreased breast cancer risk relative to women whose breast density category remains stable. Two measures of breast density may inform women's risk beyond a measure at one point in time.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "TOSYMA was a randomised, open-label, superiority trial done at 17 screening units in two federal states of Germany. Eligible participants were women aged 50-69 years who had been invited to participate in a population-wide, quality-controlled mammography screening programme. Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography or digital mammography alone using block randomisation (block size of 32), stratified by site. The primary endpoints were the detection rate of invasive breast cancer and invasive interval cancer rate at 24 months, analysed in the modified full analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who underwent either type of screening examination. Ten examinations, corresponding to a second study participation, were excluded. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Interval cancer rates will be reported in the follow-up study. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, which included all participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is closed to accrual.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between July 5, 2018, and Dec 30, 2020, 99 689 women were randomly assigned to digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography (n=49 804) or digital mammography (n=49 830). Invasive breast cancers were detected in 354 of 49 715 women with evaluable primary endpoint data in the digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D group (detection rate 7·1 cases per 1000 women screened) and in 240 of 49 762 women in the digital mammography group (4·8 cases per 1000 women screened; odds ratio 1·48 [95% CI 1·25-1·75]; p<0·0001). Adverse events and device deficiencies were rare (six adverse events in each group; 23 device deficiencies in the digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D group vs five device deficiencies in the digital mammography group) and no serious adverse events were reported.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results from this study indicate that the detection rate for invasive breast cancer was significantly higher with digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography than digital mammography alone. Evaluation of interval cancer rates in the follow-up study will further help to investigate incremental long-term benefits of digital breast tomosynthesis screening.",

        "Methods": "We used evidence-based methods to apply new knowledge in refining the international harmonized recommendations developed in 2013. The guideline panel updated the systematic literature review, developed evidence summaries, appraised the evidence, and updated recommendations on the basis of evidence, clinical judgement, and consideration of benefits versus the harms of the surveillance interventions while attaining flexibility in implementation across different health care systems. The GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework was used to translate evidence to recommendations. A survivor information form was developed to counsel survivors about the potential harms and benefits of surveillance.",
        "Results/Findings": "The literature update identified new study findings related to the effects of prescribed moderate-dose chest radiation (10 to 19 Gy), radiation dose-volume, anthracyclines and alkylating agents in non-chest irradiated survivors, and the effects of ovarian function on breast cancer risk. Moreover, new data from prospective investigations were available regarding the performance metrics of mammography and magnetic resonance imaging among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. Modified recommendations include the performance of mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging for survivors treated with 10 Gy or greater chest radiation (strong recommendation) and upper abdominal radiation exposing breast tissue at a young age (moderate recommendation) at least annually up to age 60 years. As a result of inconsistent evidence, no recommendation could be formulated for routine breast cancer surveillance for survivors treated with any type of anthracyclines in the absence of chest radiation.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The newly identified evidence prompted significant change to the recommendations formulated in 2013 related to moderate-dose chest radiation and anthracycline exposure as well as breast cancer surveillance modality.",

        "Methods": "This meta-analysis was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2019 for studies comparing the diagnostic performance of ABB-MRI and FDP-MRI in the breast. Studies were reviewed by two authors independently according to eligibility and exclusion criteria and split into two subgroups (screening population studies and studies using cohorts enriched with known cancers) to avoid bias. Quality assessment and bias for diagnostic accuracy was determined with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The diagnostic accuracy for each subgroup was pooled using a bivariate random effects model and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves produced. Sensitivities and specificities were compared using a paired t-test.",
        "Results/Findings": "Five screening (62/2,588 cancers/patients) and eight enriched cohort (540/1,432 cancers/patients) studies were included in the meta-analysis. QUADAS-2 assessment showed a low risk of bias in most studies. The pooled sensitivity/specificity/area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for screening studies was 0.90/0.92/0.94 for ABB-MRI and 0.92/0.95/0.97 for FDP-MRI. The pooled sensitivity/specificity/AUC for enriched cohort studies was 0.93/0.83/0.94 for ABB-MRI and 0.93/0.84/0.95 for FDP-MRI. There was no significant difference in sensitivity or specificity using ABB-MRI or FDP-MRI (p=0.18 and 0.27, p=0.18 and 0.93, respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The diagnostic performances of the ABB-MRI and FDP-MRI protocols used in either screening or enriched cohorts were comparable. There was a large variation in patient population, study methodology, and abbreviated protocols reported.",

        "Methods": "A systematic search was undertaken in multiple databases. Cohort studies without enrichment, presenting accuracy data of abMRI in screening, for any level of risk (population, moderate, high risk) were included. Level of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Meta-analyses (bivariate random effects model) were performed for abMRI, with fpMRI and histology from fpMRI-positive cases as reference standard, and with follow-up to symptomatic detection added to the fpMRI. The review also covers evidence comparing abMRI with mammographic techniques.",
        "Results/Findings": "The title and abstract review retrieved 23 articles. Five studies (six articles) were included (2,763 women, 3,251 screening rounds). GRADE assessment of the evidence was very low because the reference standard was interpreted with knowledge of the index test and biopsy was not obtained for all abMRI positives. The overall sensitivity for abMRI, with fpMRI (and histology for fpMRI positives) as reference standard, was 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 85.5-98.2) and specificity as 94.6% (95% CI: 91.5-96.6). Three studies (1,450 women, 1,613 screening rounds) presented follow-up data, enabling comparison between abMRI and fpMRI. Sensitivities and specificities for abMRI did not differ significantly from those for fpMRI (p=0.83 and p=0.37, respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A very low level of evidence suggests abMRI could be accurate for breast cancer screening. Research is required, with follow-up to interval cancer, to determine the effect its use could have on clinical outcome.",

Electronic databases (2009-July 2017) were searched for studies comparing tomosynthesis and 2D mammography in asymptomatic women who attended population breast cancer screening and reporting cancer detection rate (CDR) and recall rate. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Seventeen studies (1 009 790 participants) were included from 413 citations. The pooled incremental CDR for tomosynthesis was 1.6 cancers per 1000 screens (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 2.0, P < .001, I2 = 36.9%). Incremental CDR was statistically significantly higher for European/Scandinavian studies, all using a \"paired\" design where women had both tests (2.4 per 1000 screens, 95% CI = 1.9 to 2.9, P < .001, I2 = 0.0%) compared with US (\"unpaired\") studies (1.1 per 1000 screens, 95% CI = 0.8 to 1.5, P < .001, I2 = 0.0%; P < .001 between strata). The recall rate for tomosynthesis was statistically significantly lower than for 2D mammography (pooled absolute reduction = -2.2%, 95% CI = -3.0 to -1.4, P < .001, I2 = 98.2%). Stratified analyses showed a decrease in US studies (pooled difference in recall rate = -2.9%, 95% CI = -3.5 to -2.4, P < .001, I2 = 92.9%) but not European/Scandinavian studies (0.5% increase in recall, 95% CI = -0.1 to 1.2, P = .12, I2 = 93.5%; P < .001 between strata). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses excluding studies with overlapping cohorts.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "A retrospective review of medical records from January 1994 to May 2014 identified 183 women who presented with a new diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum. MR images were available for 53 of these patients, all of whom were included in the study. Clinical history and available breast images were reviewed. The clinical impact of preoperative breast MRI was also recorded.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 53 women, nine (17%) presented during pregnancy and 44 (83%) presented during the first year postpartum. The sensitivity of MRI was 98% (52/53). Among the 53 patients, the most common findings of PABC on MRI included a solitary mass (29 patients [55%]), nonmass enhancement (12 patients [23%]), and multiple masses (eight patients [15%]). For 12 patients (23%), MRI showed a pathologically proven larger tumor size or greater extent of disease than did mammography or ultrasound, with an additional eight patients (15%) having findings suspicious for greater extent of disease but having unavailable pathologic data. Breast MRI changed surgical management for 15 patients (28%), with four patients (8%) requiring a larger lumpectomy, seven (13%) no longer being considered candidates for lumpectomy, two (4%) having contralateral disease, and two (4%) having unsuspected metastasis.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI had a high sensitivity for PABC in our study population. MRI may play an important role in PABC because it changed the surgical management of 28% of patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We followed 988 090 women aged 49-64 years in 1991 resident in England and Wales, who because of the staggered implementation of the NHSBSP, included both invited subjects and an uninvited control group. Individual-level breast screening histories were linked to individual-level mortality and breast cancer incidence data from national registers. Risk of death from breast cancer was investigated by incidence-based mortality analyses in relation to intention to screen and first round attendance. Overdiagnosis of breast cancer following a single screening round was also investigated.",
        "Results/Findings": "Invitation to NHSBSP screening was associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality in 1991-2005 of 21% (RR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.73-0.84, P<0·001) after adjustment for age, socioeconomic status and lead-time. Breast cancer deaths among first invitation attenders were 46% lower than among non-attenders (RR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.51-0·57, P<0.001) and 32% lower following adjustment for age, socioeconomic status and self-selection bias (RR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.63-0·73, P<0.001). There was little evidence of overdiagnosis associated with invitation to first screen.",

        "Results/Findings": "Molecular breast imaging screening of 1696 women in this study resulted in the detection of 13 mammographically occult malignancies, of which 11 were invasive, one was node positive, and one had unknown node positivity. The lesion size ranged from 0.6 to 2.4 cm, with a mean of 1.1 cm. The incremental cancer detection rate was 7.7‰ (95% CI, 4.5-13.1‰), the recall rate was 8.4% (95% CI, 7.2-9.8%), and the biopsy rate was 3.7% (95% CI, 2.9%-4.7%).

In addition, the USPSTF reviewed comparative decision models on optimal starting and stopping ages and intervals for screening mammography; how breast density, breast cancer risk, and comorbidity level affect the balance of benefit and harms of screening mammography; and the number of radiation-induced breast cancer cases and deaths associated with different screening mammography strategies over the course of a woman's lifetime.",
        "Results/Findings": "This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 40 years or older who do not have preexisting breast cancer or a previously diagnosed high-risk breast lesion and who are not at high risk for breast cancer because of a known underlying genetic mutation (such as a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation or other familial breast cancer syndrome) or a history of chest radiation at a young age.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years. (B recommendation) The decision to start screening mammography in women prior to age 50 years should be an individual one. Women who place a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as a primary screening method for breast cancer.

Two thousand six hundred sixty-two participants completed three annual screens (7473 examinations) with US and film-screen (n = 4351) or digital (n = 3122) mammography and had biopsy or 12-month follow-up. Cancer detection, recall, and positive predictive values were determined. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "One hundred ten women had 111 breast cancer events: 89 (80.2%) invasive cancers, median size 12 mm. The number of US screens to detect one cancer was 129 (95% bootstrap confidence interval [CI] = 110 to 156), and for mammography 127 (95% CI = 109 to 152). Cancer detection was comparable for each of US and mammography at 58 of 111 (52.3%) vs 59 of 111 (53.2%, P = .90), with US-detected cancers more likely invasive (53/58, 91.4%, median size 12 mm, range = 2-40 mm), vs mammography at 41 of 59 (69.5%, median size 13 mm, range = 1-55 mm, P < .001). Invasive cancers detected by US were more frequently node-negative, 34 of 53 (64.2%) vs 18 of 41 (43.9%) by mammography (P = .003). For 4814 incidence screens (years 2 and 3), US had higher recall and biopsy rates and lower PPV of biopsy (PPV3) than mammography: The recall rate was 10.7% (n = 515) vs 9.4% (n = 453, P = .03), the biopsy rate was 5.5% (n = 266) vs 2.0% (n = 97, P < .001), and PPV3 was 11.7% (31/266) vs 38.1% (37/97, P < .001).",

        "Methods": "We obtained aggregate data for screen-detected cancers from 84 local screening units within 11 regional Quality Assurance Reference Centres in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. Data for DCIS diagnoses were obtained for women aged 50-64 years who were invited to and attended mammographic breast screening from April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007 (4 screening years). Patient-level data for interval cancer arising in the 36 months after each of these were analysed by Poisson regression with invasive interval cancer screen detection rate as the outcome variable; DCIS detection frequencies were fitted first as a continuous and then as a categorical variable. We repeated this analysis after adjustment with both small size and high-grade invasive screen-detected cancers.",
        "Results/Findings": "We analysed data for 5,243,658 women and on interval cancers occurring in the 36 months after the relevant screen. The average frequency of DCIS detected at screening was 1·60 per 1000 women screened (median 1·50 [unit range 0·54-3·56] [corrected to] per 1000 women). There was a significant negative association of screen-detected DCIS cases with the rate of invasive interval cancers (Poisson regression coefficient -0·084 [95% CI -0·13 to -0·03]; p=0·002). 90% of units had a DCIS detection frequency within the range of 1·00 to 2·22 per 1000 women; in these units, for every three screen-detected cases of DCIS, there was one fewer invasive interval cancer in the next 3 years. This association remained after adjustment for numbers of small screen-detected invasive cancers and for numbers of grade 3 invasive screen-detected cancers.",

        "Methods": "To systematically synthesize available evidence on the association of mammographic screening and clinical breast examination (CBE) at different ages and intervals with breast cancer mortality, overdiagnosis, false-positive biopsy findings, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy.",
        "Results/Findings": "We searched PubMed (to March 6, 2014), CINAHL (to September 10, 2013), and PsycINFO (to September 10, 2013) for systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (with no limit to publication date), and observational and modeling studies published after January 1, 2000, as well as systematic reviews of all study designs. Included studies (7 reviews, 10 RCTs, 72 observational, 1 modeling) provided evidence on the association between screening with mammography, CBE, or both and prespecified critical outcomes among women at average risk of breast cancer (no known genetic susceptibility, family history, previous breast neoplasia, or chest irradiation). We used summary estimates from existing reviews, supplemented by qualitative synthesis of studies not included in those reviews.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Across all ages of women at average risk, pooled estimates of association between mammography screening and mortality reduction after 13 years of follow-up were similar for 3 meta-analyses of clinical trials (UK Independent Panel: relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.89]; Canadian Task Force: RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74-0.94]; Cochrane: RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87]); were greater in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.81]); and were comparable in a modeling study (CISNET; median RR equivalent among 7 models, 0.85 [range, 0.77-0.93]). Uncertainty remains about the magnitude of associated mortality reduction in the entire US population, among women 40 to 49 years, and with annual screening compared with biennial screening. There is uncertainty about the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with different screening strategies, attributable in part to lack of consensus on methods of estimation and the importance of ductal carcinoma in situ in overdiagnosis. For women with a first mammography screening at age 40 years, estimated 10-year cumulative risk of a false-positive biopsy result was higher (7.0% [95% CI, 6.1%-7.8%]) for annual compared with biennial (4.8% [95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%]) screening. Although 10-year probabilities of false-positive biopsy results were similar for women beginning screening at age 50 years, indirect estimates of lifetime probability of false-positive results were lower. Evidence for the relationship between screening and life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy was low in quality. There was no direct evidence for any additional mortality benefit associated with the addition of CBE to mammography, but observational evidence from the United States and Canada suggested an increase in false-positive findings compared with mammography alone, with both studies finding an estimated 55 additional false-positive findings per extra breast cancer detected with the addition of CBE.",

        "Methods": "To update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2003 breast cancer screening guideline for women at average risk for breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "The ACS commissioned a systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature to inform the update and a supplemental analysis of mammography registry data to address questions related to the screening interval. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients participating in surveillance after an LCIS diagnosis are observed in a prospectively maintained database. Comparisons were made among women choosing surveillance, with or without chemoprevention, and those undergoing bilateral prophylactic mastectomies between 1980 and 2009.",
        "Results/Findings": "One thousand sixty patients with LCIS without concurrent breast cancer were identified. Median age at LCIS diagnosis was 50 years (range, 27 to 83 years). Fifty-six patients (5%) underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy; 1,004 chose surveillance with (n = 173) or without (n = 831) chemoprevention. At a median follow-up of 81 months (range, 6 to 368 months), 150 patients developed 168 breast cancers (63% ipsilateral, 25% contralateral, 12% bilateral), with no dominant histology (ductal carcinoma in situ, 35%; infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 29%; infiltrating lobular carcinoma, 27%; other, 9%). Breast cancer incidence was significantly reduced in women taking chemoprevention (10-year cumulative risk: 7% with chemoprevention; 21% with no chemoprevention; P < .001). In multivariable analysis, chemoprevention was the only clinical factor associated with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.50). In a subgroup nested case-control analysis, volume of disease, which was defined as the ratio of slides with LCIS to total number of slides reviewed, was also associated with breast cancer development (P = .008).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We observed a 2% annual incidence of breast cancer among women with LCIS. Common clinical factors used for risk prediction, including age and family history, were not associated with breast cancer risk. The lower breast cancer incidence in women opting for chemoprevention highlights the potential for risk reduction in this population.",

        "Results/Findings": "Over a 10-year period, 103 women (mean age 46 years, range 25-72 years) underwent MRI for evaluation of nipple discharge. Ninety-one patients (88 %) underwent surgical excision or had clinical and/or radiographic follow-up at least 2 years after presentation and thus comprise the study population. Eleven (30 %) of 37 patients with MRIs coded as American College of Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 of 5 were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 6) or invasive adenocarcinoma (n = 5). Seven (64 %) of 11 patients diagnosed with malignancy had a negative mammographic and sonographic workup. None of the patients with MRIs coded as BI-RADS 1, 2, or 3 was diagnosed with malignancy immediately after presentation or during the 2-year follow-up period. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the detection of malignancy were 100 % (11 of 11) and 68 % (54 of 80), respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 37 and 100 %, respectively.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Women aged 39-41 from 23 UK NHS Breast Screening Programme units years were randomly assigned by individual randomisation (1:2) to either an intervention group offered annual screening by mammography up to and including the calendar year of their 48th birthday or to a control group receiving usual medical care (invited for screening at age 50 years and every 3 years thereafter). Both groups were stratified by general practice. We compared breast cancer incidence and mortality by time since randomisation. Analyses included all women randomly assigned who could be traced with the National Health Service Central Register and who had not died or emigrated before entry. The primary outcome measures were mortality from breast cancer (defined as deaths with breast cancer coded as the underlying cause of death) and breast cancer incidence, including in-situ, invasive, and total incidence. Because there is an interest in the timing of the mortality effect, we analysed the results in different follow-up periods. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN24647151.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 14, 1990, and Sept 25, 1997, 160 921 participants were randomly assigned; 53 883 women in the intervention group and 106 953 assigned to usual medical care were included in this analysis. After a median follow-up of 17 years (IQR 16·8-18·8), the rate ratio (RR) for breast cancer mortality was 0·88 (95% CI 0·74-1·04) from tumours diagnosed during the intervention phase. A significant reduction in breast cancer mortality was noted in the intervention group compared with the control group in the first 10 years after diagnosis (RR 0·75, 0·58-0·97) but not thereafter (RR 1·02, 0·80-1·30) from tumours diagnosed during the intervention phase. The overall breast cancer incidence during 17 year follow-up was similar between the intervention group and the control group (RR 0·98, 0·93-1·04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results support an early reduction in mortality from breast cancer with annual mammography screening in women aged 40-49 years. Further data are needed to fully understand long-term effects. Cumulative incidence figures suggest at worst a small amount of overdiagnosis.",

        "Methods": "In this multicenter, multireader, retrospective reading study (the TOMMY trial), after written informed consent was obtained, 8869 women (age range, 29-85 years; mean, 56 years) were recruited from July 2011 to March 2013 in an ethically approved study. From these women, a reading dataset of 7060 cases was randomly allocated for independent blinded review of (a) 2D mammography images, (b) 2D mammography plus DBT images, and (c) synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT images. Reviewers had no access to results of previous examinations. Overall sensitivities and specificities were calculated for younger women and those with dense breasts.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall sensitivity was 87% for 2D mammography, 89% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 88% for synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT. The addition of DBT was associated with a 34% increase in the odds of depicting cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, P = .06); however, this level did not achieve significance. For patients aged 50-59 years old, sensitivity was significantly higher (P = .01) for 2D mammography plus DBT than it was for 2D mammography. For those with breast density of 50% or more, sensitivity was 86% for 2D mammography compared with 93% for 2D mammography plus DBT (P = .03). Specificity was 57% for 2D mammography, 70% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 72% for synthetic 2D mammography plusmDBT. Specificity was significantly higher than 2D mammography (P < .001in both cases) and was observed for all subgroups (P < .001 for all cases).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of DBT increased the sensitivity of 2D mammography in patients with dense breasts and the specificity of 2D mammography for all subgroups. The use of synthetic 2D DBT demonstrated performance similar to that of standard 2D mammography with DBT. DBT is of potential benefit to screening programs, particularly in younger women with dense breasts. (©) RSNA, 2015.",

After the injection of 740-1110 MBq of Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) SestaMIBI intravenously, scintigrams were obtained in two projections comparable to MG. The BSGI was analysed visually and semi-quantitatively by calculating a relative uptake factor (X). With the exception of two patients with cardiac pacemakers, all patients underwent 3-T breast MRI. Biopsy results were obtained as the reference standard in all patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, accuracy and area under the curve were calculated for each modality.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among the 92 lesions, 67 (72.8%) were malignant. 60 of the 67 cancers of any size were detected by BSGI with an overall sensitivity of 90%, only exceeded by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 99%. The sensitivity of BSGI for lesions <1 cm declined significantly to 60%. Overall specificity of ultrasound was only 20%. Specificity, accuracy and positive-predictive value were the highest for BSGI (56%, 80% and 85%, respectively). X was significantly higher for malignant lesions (mean, 4.27) and differed significantly between ductal types (mean, 4.53) and the other histopathological entities (mean, 3.12).",

The exception is cases in which mammography shows a clearly benign correlate or a normal, fatty area of breast tissue in the location of the palpable finding. Breast ultrasound should be the primary imaging tool for women with palpable lumps who are pregnant, lactating, or younger than 30 years. For women 40 years old and older, mammography, followed in most cases by ultrasound, is recommended.

Seven of 12 programs, representing 85% of the Canadian population, participated in the study. Data were obtained from the screening programs and corresponding cancer registries on screening mammograms and breast cancer diagnoses and deaths for the period between 1990 and 2009. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated comparing observed mortality in participants to that expected based upon nonparticipant rates. A substudy using data from British Columbia women aged 35 to 44 years was conducted to assess the potential effect of self-selection participation bias. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Data were obtained on 2796472 screening participants. The average breast cancer mortality among participants was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33% to 48%) lower than expected, with a range across provinces of 27% to 59%. Age at entry into screening did not greatly affect the magnitude of the average reduction in mortality, which varied between 35% and 44% overall.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Screening with Tomosynthesis OR standard Mammography (STORM) was a prospective comparative study. We recruited asymptomatic women aged 48 years or older who attended population-based breast-cancer screening through the Trento and Verona screening services (Italy) from August, 2011, to June, 2012. We did screen-reading in two sequential phases-2D only and integrated 2D and 3D mammography-yielding paired data for each screen. Standard double-reading by breast radiologists determined whether to recall the participant based on positive mammography at either screen read. Outcomes were measured from final assessment or excision histology. Primary outcome measures were the number of detected cancers, the number of detected cancers per 1000 screens, the number and proportion of false positive recalls, and incremental cancer detection attributable to integrated 2D and 3D mammography. We compared paired binary data with McNemar's test.",
        "Results/Findings": "7292 women were screened (median age 58 years [IQR 54-63]). We detected 59 breast cancers (including 52 invasive cancers) in 57 women. Both 2D and integrated 2D and 3D screening detected 39 cancers. We detected 20 cancers with integrated 2D and 3D only versus none with 2D screening only (p<0.0001). Cancer detection rates were 5.3 cancers per 1000 screens (95% CI 3.8-7.3) for 2D only, and 8.1 cancers per 1000 screens (6.2-10.4) for integrated 2D and 3D screening. The incremental cancer detection rate attributable to integrated 2D and 3D mammography was 2.7 cancers per 1000 screens (1.7-4.2). 395 screens (5.5%; 95% CI 5.0-6.0) resulted in false positive recalls: 181 at both screen reads, and 141 with 2D only versus 73 with integrated 2D and 3D screening (p<0.0001). We estimated that conditional recall (positive integrated 2D and 3D mammography as a condition to recall) could have reduced false positive recalls by 17.2% (95% CI 13.6-21.3) without missing any of the cancers detected in the study population.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Integrated 2D and 3D mammography improves breast-cancer detection and has the potential to reduce false positive recalls. Randomised controlled trials are needed to compare integrated 2D and 3D mammography with 2D mammography for breast cancer screening.",

        "Results/Findings": "With the screening, 63 biopsies were performed in 45 women; 18 (29%) showed a malignancy. All but one of the screen-detected malignancies were preinvasive or subcentimeter node-negative breast cancers. After excluding first-screen MRI and mammogram, mammogram sensitivity was 68% as compared with 67% for MRI (P = 1.0). Sensitivity increased to 94% using both screening modalities. The specificities of mammogram alone, MRI alone, and both were 93%, 94%, and 90%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In contrast to women with genetic or familial risk, in HL survivors breast MRI was not more sensitive than mammogram for breast cancer detection. However, the two screening modalities complement each other in the detection of early cases of disease. Early diagnosis is particularly important in these patients, given the breast cancer treatment challenges in patients who have received prior cancer therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "One hundred forty-six women, with 158 abnormalities, underwent diagnostic mammography and two-view DBT. Three radiologists viewed the abnormal screening mammograms, comparison mammograms, and DBT images and recorded a DBT BI-RADS category and confidence score for each finding. Readers did not view the diagnostic mammograms. A final DBT BI-RADS category, incorporating ultrasound results in some cases, was determined and compared with the diagnostic mammography BI-RADS category using kappa statistics. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for DBT and diagnostic mammography.",
        "Results/Findings": "Agreement between DBT and diagnostic mammography BI-RADS categories was excellent for readers 1 and 2 (κ = 0.91 and κ = 0.84) and good for reader 3 (κ = 0.68). For readers 1, 2, and 3, sensitivity and specificity of DBT for breast abnormalities were 100%, 100%, and 88% and 94%, 93%, and 89%, respectively. The clinical workup averaged three diagnostic views per abnormality and ultrasound was requested in 49% of the cases. DBT was adequate mammographic evaluation for 93-99% of the findings and ultrasound was requested in 33-55% of the cases.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results of this study suggest that DBT can replace conventional diagnostic mammography views for the evaluation of noncalcified findings recalled from screening mammography and achieve similar sensitivity and specificity. Two-view DBT was considered adequate mammographic evaluation for more than 90% of the findings. There was minimal change in the use of ultrasound with DBT compared with diagnostic mammography.",

False-positive rates before arbitration were 61.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography alone and 53.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography plus tomosynthesis (15% decrease, adjusted for reader; P < .001). After arbitration, positive predictive values for recalled patients with cancers verified later were comparable (29.1% and 28.5%, respectively, with mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis; P = .72). Twenty-five additional invasive cancers were detected with mammography plus tomosynthesis (40% increase, adjusted for reader; P < .001).

The malignant or benign nature of the lesions was established by histologic analysis of biopsied lesions or by 12-16-month follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "Eighty-six of the 144 patients were found to have breast cancer. The BI-RADS categories for one-view digital breast tomosynthesis were significantly better than those for two-view FFDM (p < 0.001) and were equal to those of the combined reading in both women admitted for diagnostic workup and women recalled from screening. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of digital breast tomosynthesis were superior to those of FFDM in fatty and dense breasts overall and in women admitted for diagnostic workup and in women recalled from screening. Only 11% of digital breast tomosynthesis examinations required additional imaging, compared with 23% of FFDMs.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease) and late-stage breast cancer (regional and distant disease) among women 40 years of age or older.",
        "Results/Findings": "The introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year, from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women--an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women. Concomitantly, the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8%, from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women--an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women. With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden, only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease. After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age, we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed (i.e., tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years. We estimated that in 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women; this accounted for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Despite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer. Although it is not certain which women have been affected, the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis, accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers, and that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.",

Study 1 comprised 312 cases (48 cancer cases) with images read by 12 radiologists; study 2, 312 cases (51 cancer cases) with 15 radiologists. Study 1 readers recorded only that an abnormality requiring recall was present; study 2 readers had additional training and recorded both lesion type and location. Diagnostic accuracy was compared with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Recall rates of noncancer cases, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values determined by analyzing Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scores were compared for the two methods.",
        "Results/Findings": "Diagnostic accuracy for combined tomosynthesis and digital mammography was superior to that of digital mammography alone. Average difference in area under the curve in study 1 was 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%, 10.8%; P < .001) and in study 2 was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.1%, 9.5%; P < .001).

The lesions in the cohort included 33% (72 of 217) cancers and 67% (145 of 217) benign lesions. Eighty-four percent (182 of 217) of the lesions were masses, 11% (25 of 217) were asymmetries, and 5% (10 of 217) were distortions that were initially detected at clinical examination in 8% (17 of 217), at mammography in 80% (173 of 217), at ultrasonography (US) in 11% (25 of 217), or at magnetic resonance imaging in 1% (2 of 217). Histopathologic examination established truth in 191 lesions, US revealed a cyst in 12 lesions, and 14 lesions had a normal follow-up. Each lesion was interpreted once with tomosynthesis and once with supplemental mammographic views; both modes included the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views in a fully crossed and balanced design by using a five-category Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and a probability-of-malignancy score. Differences between modes were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model for BI-RADS-based sensitivity and specificity and with modified Obuchowski-Rockette approach for probability-of-malignancy-based area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.",
        "Results/Findings": "Average probability-of-malignancy-based area under the ROC curve was 0.87 for tomosynthesis versus 0.83 for supplemental views (P < .001).

Much of the current controversy on breast cancer screening is due to the use of inappropriate methodological approaches that are unable to capture the true effect of mammographic screening.",

        "Methods": "Informed consent was waived for this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of 935 women with dense breasts at mammography who subsequently underwent handheld screening and whole-breast US from October 1, 2009, through September 30, 2010.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 935 women, 614 (65.7%) were at low risk, 149 (15.9%) were at intermediate risk, and 87 (9.3%) were at high risk for breast cancer. Of the screening breast US examinations, in 701 (75.0%), results were classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 1 or 2; in 187 (20.0%), results were classified as BI-RADS category 3; and in 47 (5.0%), results were classified as BI-RADS category 4. Of 63 aspirations or biopsies recommended and performed in 53 patients, in nine, lesions were BI-RADS category 3, and in 54, lesions were BI-RADS category 4. Among 63 biopsies and aspirations, three lesions were malignant (all BI-RADS category 4, diagnosed with biopsy). All three cancers were smaller than 1 cm, were found in postmenopausal patients, and were solid masses. One cancer was found in each risk group. In 44 of 935 (4.7%) patients, examination results were false-positive. Overall positive predictive value (PPV) for biopsy or aspirations performed in patients with BI-RADS category 4 masses was 6.5% (three of 46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 19%). Overall cancer detection rate was 3.2 cancers per 1000 women screened (three of 935; 95% CI: 0.8 cancers per 1000 women screened, 10 cancers per 1000 women screened).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Technologist-performed handheld screening breast US offered to women in the general population with dense breasts can aid detection of small mammographically occult breast cancers (cancer detection rate, 0.8-10 cancers per 1000 women screened), although the overall PPV is low.",

After 3 screening rounds (6-8 years after randomization), the PSP was invited to screening. The cumulative incidence of breast cancer was calculated in the ASP and PSP from randomization to 29 years later. In addition, cumulative incidence was calculated for invasive cancers, advanced invasive cancers (≥ 2 cm in maximum diameter or node-positive), and nonadvanced cancers (<2 cm and node negative).",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no excess of cancers in the ASP at 29 year follow-up (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.08). Cumulative incidence in the 2 arms approximately equalized at the conclusion of the first round of screening of the PSP. There was an excess of nonadvanced cancers and a deficit of advanced cancers in the ASP, both of which persisted to 29 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "There was no additional breast cancer incidence associated with 100,000 additional screens in the ASP. Results suggest that overdiagnosis is small and largely confined to the prevalence screen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "i This study was institutional review board approved, with a waiver of informed consent, and HIPAA compliant. A longitudinal prospective cohort study was conducted of women aged 40-49 years who had primary breast cancer, during 1990-2008, and were identified and tracked by a dedicated registry database (n = 1977). Method of detection--patient detected (PtD), physician detected (PhysD), or mammography detected (MamD)--was chart abstracted. Disease-specific survival and relapse-free survival statistics were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method for stage I-IV breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "A significant increase in the percentage of MamD breast cancer over time (28%-58%) and a concurrent decline in patient and physician detected (Pt/PhysD) breast cancer (73%-42%) (Pearson x(2) = 72.72, P < .001) were observed over time from 1990 to 2008, with an overall increase in lower-stage disease detection and a decrease in higher-stage disease. MamD breast cancer patients were more likely to undergo lumpectomy (67% vs 48% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients) and less likely to undergo modified radical mastectomy (25% vs 47% of the Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients) (P < .001). Uncorrected for stage, 13% of MamD breast cancer patients underwent surgery and chemotherapy versus 22% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients (P < .001), and 31% of MamD breast cancer patients underwent surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy versus 59% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients (x(2) = 305.13, P < .001). Analyzing invasive cancers only, 5-year relapse-free survival for MamD breast cancer patients was 92% versus 88% for Pt/PhysD patients (log-rank test, 12.47; P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Increased mammography-detected breast cancer over time coincided with lower-stage disease detection resulting in reduced treatment and lower rates of recurrence, adding factors to consider when evaluating the benefits of mammography screening of women aged 40-49 years.",

They were asked the date and injection site of the vaccination. Examinees were divided into 2 groups based on the interval after vaccination using a cutoff value of 7 days (1 week). Two double board-certified nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists visually interpreted the FDG-PET/CT images with reference to PET/CT fusion and CT images and checked the location and the number of abnormal accumulations by consensus reading.",

        "Methods": "This IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant reader study obtained informed consent from all subjects. Four blinded Mammography Quality Standards Act-certified academic radiologists individually evaluated DBT images and MSVs of 67 masses (30 malignant, 37 benign) in 67 women (age range, 34-88 years). Images were viewed in random order at separate counterbalanced sessions and were rated for visibility (10-point scale), likelihood of malignancy (12-point scale), and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. Differences in mass visibility were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Reader performance was measured by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) and partial area index above a sensitivity threshold of 0.90 (A(z)(0.90)) by using likelihood of malignancy ratings. Masses categorized as BI-RADS 4 or 5 were compared with histopathologic analysis to determine true-positive results for each modality.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mean mass visibility ratings were slightly better with DBT (range, 3.2-4.4) than with MSV (range, 3.8-4.8) for all four readers, with one reader's improvement achieving statistical significance (P = .001). The A(z) ranged 0.89-0.93 for DBT and 0.88-0.93 for MSV (P ≥ .23). The A(z)((0.90)) ranged 0.36-0.52 for DBT and 0.25-0.40 for MSV (P ≥ .20). The readers characterized seven additional malignant masses as BI-RADS 4 or 5 with DBT than with MSV, at a cost of five false-positive biopsy recommendations, with a mean of 1.8 true-positive (range, 0-3) and 1.3 false-positive (range, -1 to 4) assessments per reader.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this small study, mass characterization in terms of visibility ratings, reader performance, and BI-RADS assessment with DBT was similar to that with MSVs.

CNBs with concurrent pleomorphic LCIS, ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma were excluded. Imaging indication/modality, biopsy indication, and radiologic concordance were determined. Pathology review included scoring total foci of LN in each CNB. Upgrade rates to invasive carcinoma or DCIS at excision were calculated.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 106 cases of LN (73 ALH and 33 LCIS) on CNB were identified. Thirty patients had concurrent atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and 76 had LN alone; 93 (88%) of the patients had available surgical follow-up (25 LN + ADH and 68 LN alone). The upgrade rate at excision was 16% (4 of 25) for LN + ADH and 4.4% (3 of 68) for LN alone. Patients with LN alone and discordant imaging, imaging for high-risk indications, or extensive LCIS (>4 foci) accounted for all the upgrades. Normal-risk patients who underwent biopsy to assess calcifications found by routine mammographic screening with LN alone did not result in upgrade.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Women with a CNB diagnosis of LN for calcifications found on routine, normal-risk mammographic screening have a negligible risk of upgrade and may not require excisional biopsy. However, excisional biopsy should be offered to women undergoing imaging for other indications or with >4 foci of LN on CNB.",

Absolute risks were obtained by combining this information with ethnicity-specific data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and with US ethnicity-specific mortality data to create the Asian American Breast Cancer Study model (AABCS model). Independent data from APA women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were used to check the calibration and discriminatory accuracy of the AABCS model.",
        "Results/Findings": "The AABCS model estimated absolute risk separately for Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, and Other Asian women. Relative and attributable risks for APA women were comparable to those in BCRAT, but the AABCS model usually estimated lower-risk projections than BCRAT in Chinese and Filipino, but not in Hawaiian women, and not in every age and ethnic subgroup. The AABCS model underestimated absolute risk by 17% (95% confidence interval = 1% to 38%) in independent data from WHI, but APA women in the WHI had incidence rates approximately 18% higher than those estimated from the SEER program.",

Examinations rated as BI-RADS categories 4 and 5 were considered positive. One hundred thirty-four (82%) of 164 lesions had pathology results available or longer than 12 months follow-up in our study group.

Mammograms were dense or heterogeneously dense in 88% of patients. All four malignancies were BI-RADS category 4 or 5 according to both mammography and ultrasound. For the 85 lesions evaluated with mammography, there was 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 40% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.

Three malignancies were detected, for a cancer yield of 0.4%. No BI-RADS category 3 lesions, two BI-RADS category 4 lesions, and the single BI-RADS category 5 lesion were malignant. Ultrasound sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 80.5%, NPV was 100%, PPV2 was 1.8%, and PPV3 was 1.9%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Women younger than 30 years with focal breast signs or symptoms have a very low (0.4%) incidence of malignancy. The 100% sensitivity and NPV of targeted ultrasound in our study substantiates its use as an accurate primary imaging test in this clinical setting. We found no malignancies in BI-RADS category 3 lesions, supporting ultrasound surveillance over biopsy in this patient population.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Breast cancer mortality was compared between women who were invited to service screening at ages 40 to 49 years (study group) and women in the same age group who were not invited during 1986 to 2005 (control group). Together, these women comprise the Mammography Screening of Young Women (SCRY) cohort, which includes all Swedish counties. A prescreening period was defined to facilitate a comparison of mortality in the absence of screening. The outcome measure was refined mortality, ie, breast cancer death for women who were diagnosed during follow-up at ages 40 to 49 years. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no significant difference in breast cancer mortality during the prescreening period. During the study period, there were 803 breast cancer deaths in the study group (7.3 million person-years) and 1238 breast cancer deaths in the control group (8.8 million person-years). The average follow-up was 16 years. The estimated RR for women who were invited to screening was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.83), and the RR for women who attended screening was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.80).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this comprehensive study, mammography screening for women ages 40 to 49 years was efficient for reducing breast cancer mortality.",

Cumulative incidence rates irrespective of nonadvanced and advanced breast cancer were higher in dense breast tissue compared with nondense tissue but no difference in survival was detected between dense and nondense breast tissue.

Patients were grouped according to number of mammograms during the 60 months before diagnosis: nonusers (0 mammograms), irregular users (one to two mammograms), and regular users (three or more mammograms). Effects of mammography on disease stage (I to IIa v IIb to IV) and survival were determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "Percentages of women with nonuse, irregular use, and regular use of mammography during the 5 years preceding diagnosis were 49%, 29%, and 22%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, patients were 0.37 times less likely to present with late-stage cancer for each mammogram obtained (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.67). Breast cancer-specific 5-year survival among nonusers was 82%, that among irregular users was 88%, and that among regular users was 94%. However, survival from causes other than breast cancer was also associated with mammography use, suggesting a bias for healthier patients to undergo mammography.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Regular mammography among women >or= 80 years of age was associated with earlier disease stage, although improved survival remains difficult to demonstrate. Health care providers should consider discussing the potential benefits of screening mammography with their older patients, particularly for those without significant comorbidity.",

Ninety five of 243 (39.1%) aspiration samples with typical cyst fluid were discarded. A total of 33/243 (13.6%) cases did not yield fluid, 1 of which was positive for cancer. Thirty cases underwent core needle or excisional biopsy for imaging discordance with benign results.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer presenting as a complicated cyst by ultrasound was rare (0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0-1.94%). These results provide support for classification of complicated cysts as probably benign.",

        "Methods": "Forty-four patients with bloody or serosanguineous nipple discharge and negative mammographic findings (35/44 cases) underwent MRI for evaluation of breast ducts. Ultrasonography, negative in 18 patients, identified 26 cases of ductal ectasia (12 simple, nine with solid intraductal echoes and wall thickening, five with inhomogeneous parenchyma). Galactography was negative in three patients and positive in nine. Nineteen patients were followed up by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and cytological evaluation of nipple discharge (6-12 months); three patients underwent excisional biopsy, ten core biopsy and 12 cytological biopsy (followed by excisional biopsy).",
        "Results/Findings": "MRI identified 25 enhancing lesions Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 3 or 4) and confirmed the galactographic findings (ductal ectasia, intraluminal filling defects). Five papillomatoses appeared as patchy, homogeneous enhancing areas, 15 intraductal papillomas as areas with well-defined margins and type II time-intensity curves, and two atypical ductal hyperplasias as diffuse nodular enhancement. One micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), one papillary carcinoma and one infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) were visualised as two segmental areas of enhancement and one mass-like enhancement with poorly defined margins (BI-RADS 4). The follow-up was negative, showing no pathological enhancement (BI-RADS 1) in 12 patients and benign enhancement (BI-RADS 2) in seven.",

To delineate characteristic features, a multitude of dynamic and morphologic parameters were evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted sequences.",
        "Results/Findings": "No significant differences of prevalences could be found for the following criteria: dynamic tumor signal characteristics, prominent vessels, perifocal edema, axillary lymph node involvement, morphology of focal masses, and morphologic pattern of non-mass like enhancement. Otherwise, the quantity of focal masses and the spatial distribution of the tumoral infiltration significantly differed between the two cancer groups. The following parameters occurred more frequently in the IBC cases: edema (cutaneous/subcutaneous 81.3%, perimamillar 70.8%, diffuse 89.6%, prepectoral 72.9%, intramuscular pectoral 41.7%), thickening (75.0%) and pathologic enhancement (60.4%) of Cooper's ligaments, skin thickening (83.3%), punched-out sign (initially strong, focal increase of some dermal or subcutaneous parts followed by slow-continuous enhancement of the surrounding skin; 56.3%).",

        "Methods": "Data from 1607 African American women with invasive breast cancer and 1647 African American control subjects in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study were used to compute relative and attributable risks that were based on age at menarche, number of affected mother or sisters, and number of previous benign biopsy examinations. Absolute risks were obtained by combining this information with data on invasive breast cancer incidence in African American women from the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program and with national mortality data. Eligibility screening data from the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial were used to determine how the new model would affect eligibility, and independent data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were used to assess how well numbers of invasive breast cancers predicted by the new model agreed with observed cancers.",
        "Results/Findings": "Tables and graphs for estimating relative risks and projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk with confidence intervals were developed for African American women. Relative risks for family history and number of biopsies and attributable risks estimated from the CARE population were lower than those from the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, as was the discriminatory accuracy (i.e., concordance). Using eligibility screening data from the STAR trial, we estimated that 30.3% of African American women would have had 5-year invasive breast cancer risks of at least 1.66% by use of the CARE model, compared with only 14.5% by use of the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. The numbers of cancers predicted by the CARE model agreed well with observed numbers of cancers (i.e., it was well calibrated) in data from the WHI, except that it underestimated risk in African American women with breast biopsy examinations.",

        "Results/Findings": "Among 306 patients, 186 (61%) underwent further evaluation with DG (n = 163) and/or MRI (n = 52), 35 (11%) underwent major duct excision alone (MDE), and 85 (28%) were followed clinically. Ultimately, 182/306 (59%) patients underwent surgery and/or biopsy. Overall incidence of malignant or high-risk pathology was 15% (46/306). DG was completed in 139/163 (85%) studies and detected 12 cancers and seven high-risk lesions (HRL), but failed to identify four cancers and 2 HRL (PPV 19%, NPV 63%). MRI detected seven cancers and three HRL, but failed to identify one cancer and one HRL (PPV 56%, NPV 87%). MDE alone (n = 35) detected five cancers and three HRL. Of all patients not having surgery, (142/306, 41%), one (0.01%) presented with an invasive cancer at 102 months (median follow-up, 6.3 months; range, 0-124 months).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "An underlying malignancy was identified in 30/306 (10%) patients with ND and negative standard evaluation. Ductography is a poor predictor of underlying pathology and cannot exclude malignancy. MRI's higher predictive values may allow for improved patient selection and treatment planning; however, MRI should not replace MDE as the gold standard to exclude malignancy in patients with ND and negative standard evaluation.",

No surgery was performed for 95% of benign lesions. Multiples operations were necessary in 12% of patients with malignant lesions of VLNB group compared to 45% in the surgical biopsy group. The rate of underdiagnosis of borderline lesions and ductal carcinomas in situ was 16% by the large-core biopsy technique.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "VLNB constitutes an alternative to surgical biopsy. This procedure avoids surgery for most benign lesions and reduces the number of surgical procedures in malignant lesions.",

        "Methods": "Using data collected between 1992 and 2000 by the New Mexico Mammography Project and cancer data through 2003 from the New Mexico Tumor Registry, we calculated breast cancer rates following 14,602 benign breast biopsies for women ages 30 to 89 years. For comparison, we also calculated the breast cancer rate following 215,283 normal screening mammograms. Hazard ratios (HR) are presented.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 480 subsequent breast cancer diagnoses among 14,602 women with benign breast biopsies and 4,402 breast cancer diagnoses among 215,283 women with mammograms assigned a \"negative\" or \"benign finding\" assessment. Histologic diagnoses in absence of atypia had an age-adjusted HR of 1.95 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.77-2.15]. Among low-risk histologic diagnoses, the strongest associations with subsequent breast cancer development included adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, calcifications, and ductal hyperplasia. Fibroadenoma, inflammation, and cysts did not exhibit an association with breast cancer development. Women with low-risk diagnoses and breast tissue characterized as fatty or with scattered densities had a HR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.68-2.60), whereas women with low-risk histologic diagnoses and dense breasts had a HR of 3.36 (95% CI, 2.83-3.99).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The observed breast cancer occurrence contributes to evidence of increased risk following benign biopsy. The risk associated with histologic diagnoses in absence of atypia was twice the risk experienced by women with normal mammogram evaluations and may be modified by breast density.",

        "Methods": "We retrospectively reviewed data from our high-risk screening program prospective database for the period from April 1999 (when screening MRI was first performed at our institution) to July 2005. Patients with AH or LCIS demonstrated on previous surgical biopsy were identified. All patients underwent yearly mammography and twice yearly clinical breast examination. Additional screening MRI was performed at the discretion of the physician and patient.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 378 patients; 126 had AH and 252 had LCIS. Of these, 182 (48%) underwent one or more screening MRIs (mean, 2.6 MRIs; range, 1-8) during this period, whereas 196 (52%) did not. Those who had MRIs were younger (P < 0.001) with stronger family histories of breast cancer (P = 0.02). In MRI-screened patients, 55 biopsies were recommended in 46/182 (25%) patients, with 46/55 (84%) biopsies based on MRI findings alone. Cancer was detected in 6/46 (13%) MRI-generated biopsies. None of the six cancers detected on MRI were seen on recent mammogram. All six cancers were detected in five patients (one with bilateral breast cancer) with LCIS; none were detected by MRI in the AH group. Thus, cancer was detected in 5/135 (4%) of patients with LCIS undergoing MRI. The yield of MRI screening overall was cancer detection in 6/46 (13%) biopsies, 5/182 (3%) MRI-screened patients and 5/478 (1%) total MRIs done. In two additional MRI-screened patients, cancer was detected by a palpable mass in one, and on prophylactic surgery in the other and missed by all recent imaging studies. For 196 non-MRI-screened patients, 21 (11%) underwent 22 biopsies during the same period. Eight of 22 (36%) biopsies yielded cancer in seven patients. All MRI-detected cancers were stage 0-I, whereas all non-MRI cancers were stage I-II.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with AH and LCIS selected to undergo MRI screening were younger with stronger family histories of breast cancer. MRI screening generated more biopsies for a large proportion of patients, and facilitated detection of cancer in only a small highly selected group of patients with LCIS.",

The trial was undertaken in 23 NHS breast-screening units in England, Wales, and Scotland. The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle and compared mortality rates in the two groups at 10 years' follow-up. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN24647151.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a mean follow-up of 10.7 years there was a reduction in breast-cancer mortality in the intervention group, in relative and absolute terms, which did not reach statistical significance (relative risk 0.83 [95% CI 0.66-1.04], p=0.11; absolute risk reduction 0.40 per 1000 women invited to screening [95% CI -0.07 to 0.87]).

Malignancy was detected on excisional biopsy in 31% of patients with ADH, 16% of patients with ALH, and 25% of patients with LCIS. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, parity, hormonal status, or previous benign breast biopsies. The presence of a mass on mammography was associated with an increased upgrade rate to malignancy, while biopsies performed using vacuum-assisted devices, larger gauge biopsy needles, and greater number of cores were associated with a lower upgrade rate.",

For the current analysis, data of 4134 screening rounds and 45 detected breast cancers were used. For both imaging modalities, screening parameters, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and uni- and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. All analyses were separately performed for age at entry (< 40, 40-49, > or =50), mutation status, menopausal status and breast density.",
        "Results/Findings": "Sensitivity of MRI was decreased in women with high breast density (adjusted OR 0.08). False-positive rates of both mammography (OR(adj) 1.67) and MRI (OR(adj) 1.21) were increased by high breast density, that of MRI by pre-menopausal status (OR(adj) 1.70), young age (OR(adj) 1.58 for women 40-49 years versus women > or =50 years) and decreased in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (OR(adj) 0.74).

The difference in false-positive rate between mammography and MRI was also largest in the first round of women previously screened with mammography (5.5 vs. 14.0%; P<.001), and it remained significant in subsequent rounds (4.6 vs. 8.2%; P<.001). Screen-detected tumors were smaller and more often lymph node negative than symptomatic tumors in age-matched control patients, but no major differences in tumor stage were found between tumors detected at subsequent rounds compared with those in the first round.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In subsequent rounds, a significantly higher sensitivity and better discriminating capacity of MRI compared with mammography was maintained, and a favorable tumor stage compared with age-matched symptomatic controls. As results of these subsequent screening rounds were most predictive for long-term effects, the authors expect that this screening program will contribute to a decrease of breast cancer mortality in these high-risk women.",

Regardless of year of diagnosis, there were a total of 6,231 deaths due to breast cancer in the period of study as a whole. Of these, 4,778 were incidence-based deaths in the two epochs, i.e., death among cases diagnosed within either the prescreening or screening period. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression and adjusted, when necessary, for self-selection bias, contemporaneous changes in incidence, and changes in mortality independent of screening.",
        "Results/Findings": "Attendance was uniformly high, averaging 75% in the screening epochs. Recall rates for assessment varied from 4% to 5% at the first round of screening and approximately 3% at later rounds. Detection rates averaged five breast cancers per 1,000 women screened in the first round, and four breast cancers per 1,000 women screened in subsequent rounds. There was a significant 45% reduction in incidence-based breast cancer mortality among screened women in the screening epoch relative to incidence-based breast cancer mortality in the prescreening epoch (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence intervals, 0.51-0.59). After adjusting for self-selection bias, there still was a significant 43% reduction in incidence-based breast cancer mortality associated with screening (relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence intervals, 0.53-0.62).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These results indicate a reduction in breast cancer mortality of between 40% and 45% in association with screening, after adjustment for self-selection bias.

A total of 1,542 annual surveillance rounds were completed with a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. Diagnostic accuracies of the three imaging modalities used alone or in different combinations were compared.",
        "Results/Findings": "Forty-three breast cancers were identified in the total cohort (34 invasive, nine ductal carcinoma-in-situ). Overall sensitivity of diagnostic imaging was 93% (40 of 43 breast cancers); overall node-positive rate was 16%, and one interval cancer occurred (one of 43 cancers, or 2%). In the analysis by modality, sensitivity was low for mammography (33%) and ultrasound (40%) or the combination of both (49%). MRI offered a significantly higher sensitivity (91%). The sensitivity of mammography in the higher risk groups was 25%, compared with 100% for MRI. Specificity of MRI (97.2%) was equivalent to that of mammography (96.8%).",

If MRI is used for surveillance, diagnosis of intraductal and invasive familial or hereditary cancer is achieved with a significantly higher sensitivity and at a more favorable stage.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Relative risks of breast cancer for categories defined by radiation dose to the chest (0, 20- < 40 Gy, or > or = 40 Gy) and use of alkylating agents (yes or no) were estimated from a case-control study conducted within an international population-based cohort of 3817 female 1-year survivors of HL diagnosed at age 30 years or younger from January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1994. To compute cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer, we used modified standardized incidence ratios to relate cohort breast cancer risks to those in the general population, enabling application of population-based breast cancer rates, and we allowed for competing risks by using population-based mortality rates in female HL survivors.",
        "Results/Findings": "Cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer increased with age at end of follow-up, time since HL diagnosis, and radiation dose. For an HL survivor who was treated at age 25 years with a chest radiation dose of at least 40 Gy without alkylating agents, estimated cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer by age 35, 45, and 55 years were 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9% to 2.1%), 11.1% (95% CI = 7.4% to 16.3%), and 29.0% (95% CI = 20.2% to 40.1%), respectively. Cumulative absolute risks were lower in women treated with alkylating agents.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer projections varied considerably by type of HL therapy, time since HL diagnosis, and age at end of follow-up. These estimates are applicable to HL survivors treated with regimens of the past and can be used to counsel such patients and plan management and preventive strategies. Projections should be used with caution, however, in patients treated with more recent approaches, including limited-field radiotherapy and/or ovary-sparing chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "A total of 49,528 asymptomatic women presenting for screening mammography at 33 sites in the United States and Canada underwent both digital and film mammography. All relevant information was available for 42,760 of these women (86.3 percent). Mammograms were interpreted independently by two radiologists. Breast-cancer status was ascertained on the basis of a breast biopsy done within 15 months after study entry or a follow-up mammogram obtained at least 10 months after study entry. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the results.",
        "Results/Findings": "In the entire population, the diagnostic accuracy of digital and film mammography was similar (difference between methods in the area under the ROC curve, 0.03; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.08; P=0.18). However, the accuracy of digital mammography was significantly higher than that of film mammography among women under the age of 50 years (difference in the area under the curve, 0.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.25; P=0.002), women with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts on mammography (difference, 0.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.18; P=0.003), and premenopausal or perimenopausal women (difference, 0.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.24; P=0.002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The overall diagnostic accuracy of digital and film mammography as a means of screening for breast cancer is similar, but digital mammography is more accurate in women under the age of 50 years, women with radiographically dense breasts, and premenopausal or perimenopausal women.

        "Methods": "We did a prospective multicentre cohort study in 649 women aged 35-49 years with a strong family history of breast cancer or a high probability of a BRCA1, BRCA2, or TP53 mutation. We recruited participants from 22 centres in the UK, and offered the women annual screening with CE MRI and mammography for 2-7 years.",
        "Results/Findings": "We diagnosed 35 cancers in the 649 women screened with both mammography and CE MRI (1881 screens): 19 by CE MRI only, six by mammography only, and eight by both, with two interval cases. Sensitivity was significantly higher for CE MRI (77%, 95% CI 60-90) than for mammography (40%, 24-58; p=0.01), and was 94% (81-99) when both methods were used. Specificity was 93% (92-95) for mammography, 81% (80-83) for CE MRI (p<0.0001), and 77% (75-79) with both methods. The difference between CE MRI and mammography sensitivities was particularly pronounced in BRCA1 carriers (13 cancers; 92%vs 23%, p=0.004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our findings indicate that CE MRI is more sensitive than mammography for cancer detection. Specificity for both procedures was acceptable. Despite a high proportion of grade 3 cancers, tumours were small and few women were node positive. Annual screening, combining CE MRI and mammography, would detect most tumours in this risk group.",

Fifty-eight percent of the lesions were < 10 mm and 70% had microcalcifications.",
        "Results/Findings": "The authors identified 7% of patients with invasive carcinomas, 15% with ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), 5% with atypical ductal hyperplasias (ADH), and 0.6% with lobular carcinomas in situ. The results of the VAB necessitated an upgrade of 24% of patients with ADH to DCIS or DCIS and invasive carcinoma. Twelve percent of patients with DCIS proved to have invasive carcinoma. Seventy-three percent of the patients had benign lesions. Only 1 false-negative result was encountered (negative predictive value, 99.95%). Minor side effects were reported to occur in 1.4% of patients and 0.1% of patients required a subsequent intervention.

Detailed treatment information and data on reproductive factors were collected for 48 case patients who developed breast cancer 5 or more years after diagnosis of HD and 175 matched control subjects. The radiation dose was estimated to the area of the breast where the case patient's tumor had developed and to a comparable location in matched control subjects. Relative risks (RRs) of breast cancer were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "The risk of breast cancer increased statistically significantly with radiation dose (P(trend) =.01); patients who received 38.5 Gy or more had an RR of 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3 to 16) times that of patients who received less than 4 Gy. Patients who received both CT and radiotherapy (RT) had a statistically significantly lower risk than those treated with RT alone (RR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.91). Breast cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose among patients who received RT only (RR = 12.7, 95% CI = 1.8 to 86, for patients receiving > or =38.5 Gy) but not among patients treated with CT and RT. Sixty-nine percent of control subjects treated with RT and more than six cycles of CT, but only 9% of those who received RT alone, reached menopause before age 41. Reaching menopause before age 36 was associated with a strongly reduced risk of breast cancer (RR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.45).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer risk increases with increasing radiation dose up to at least 40 Gy. The substantial risk reduction associated with CT may reflect its effect on menopausal age, suggesting that ovarian hormones promote tumorigenesis after radiation has produced an initiating event.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 3835 breasts were examined in 2020 patients, with a 6.3% prevalence of breast cancer. Breast US detected 8 extra malignancies and correctly downgraded 332 cases from a positive to a negative diagnosis (ie, from a suggested malignancy to no malignancy). Receiver-operating characteristic curves showed a significant improvement in diagnostic value by adding US to MAM and a CE (area under the curve for CE + MAM + US vs CE + MAM, 0.99 vs 0.95; P =.002). The diagnostic yield improved significantly in patients referred for palpable breast lumps (P =.004) or referred from the National Breast Cancer Screening Program (P =.05). Less pronounced was the value in patients referred for other symptoms or for follow-up of a prior breast malignancy. When breast imaging of the contralateral breast or of asymptomatic patients referred for reassurance or follow-up of a prior benign lesion was performed, the value of additional US remained undefined because of the few malignancies found.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "From a database of 2,072 image-guided procedures performed from July 1995 through September 2001, 150 cystic lesions were identified. Diagnosis was established with fine-needle aspiration (n = 55), 14-gauge core-needle biopsy (n = 81), or both (n = 14). Excision was performed for all malignant (n = 18) and atypical (n = 2) lesions and for 11 benign lesions, which recurred or enlarged at follow-up. Imaging follow-up was available for 92 of 119 benign lesions. Targeted sonography was performed with high-frequency (10-MHz center frequency) transducers. Imaging and histopathologic, cytologic, and/or microbiologic findings were reviewed. Lesions were categorized as simple cysts, complicated cysts (imperceptible wall, acoustic enhancement, low-level echoes), clustered microcysts, cystic masses with a thick (perceptible) wall and/or thick (> or =0.5 mm) septations, intracystic or mixed cystic and solid masses (at least 50% cystic), or predominantly solid masses with eccentric cystic foci.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 150 lesions, 16 were simple cysts aspirated for symptomatic relief. Of 38 lesions characterized as complicated cysts and one cyst with thin septations, none proved malignant, nor did any of 16 lesions characterized as clustered microcysts. Of 23 masses with thick indistinct walls or thick septations, seven proved malignant. Of 18 intracystic or mixed cystic and solid masses, four proved malignant. Of 38 predominantly solid masses with eccentric cystic foci, seven proved malignant.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Symptomatic complicated cysts generally warrant aspiration. All clustered microcysts were benign, but further study is required. Cystic lesions with thick indistinct walls and/or thick septations (> or =0.5 mm), intracystic masses, and predominantly solid masses with eccentric cystic foci should be examined at biopsy; 18 of 79 of such complex cystic lesions proved malignant in this series.",

        "Methods": "Seventy-three consecutive biopsies of breast masses were performed by using a 14-gauge handheld biopsy device. Each specimen was graded for whether it was nonfragmented or fragmented and for whether it sank or floated, and each pass was graded for whether or not the needle passed through the lesion. Each specimen was mounted on a separate slide. A pathologist who was unaware of the final diagnoses reviewed the slides in random order. A diagnosis was determined for each specimen whenever possible, and diagnostic yield was calculated as a function of number of passes. The Fisher exact test was used to compare yield for different specimen characteristics.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fourteen (19%) lesions were malignant and 59 (81%) were benign. Cells indicating the final diagnosis were contained in 249 (75%) of 334 specimens. Cells indicating the diagnosis were contained in the first specimen in 51 (70%) lesions, in the second specimen in 67 (92%), in the third specimen in 70 (96%), and in the fourth specimen in 73 (100%). Of the 14 malignancies, 13 (93%) were diagnosed with cells contained in the first or second specimen; one cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ) was diagnosed with cells contained in the fourth specimen. Specimens that were nonfragmented (P <.001) and sank (P <.001) showed correlation with being diagnostic, but needle visualization within the lesion did not.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A minimum of four specimens, preferably those that are nonfragmented and that sink, should be obtained with 14-gauge US-guided breast biopsy.",

        "Methods": "We did a retrospective cohort study of 252 women who had undergone 261 benign surgical biopsies that showed atypical lobular hyperplasia from 1950 to 1985, as part of the Nashville Breast Studies. Primary outcomes were development of invasive breast cancer and laterality of cancer compared with side of the biopsied breast.",
        "Results/Findings": "50 (20%) of 252 women treated by biopsy only developed invasive breast cancer. Relative risk of breast cancer in women with atypical lobular hyperplasia was 3.1 (95% CI 2.3-4.3, p<0.0001). Of these 50 women, the breast with invasive cancer was the same breast diagnosed with atypical lobular hyperplasia (ipsilateral) in 34 (68%) and the contralateral breast in 12 (24%). The ratio of ipsilateral/ contralateral cancers for atypical lobular hyperplasia without other atypical lesions was 17/5. For six women with atypical lobular hyperplasia plus atypical ductal hyperplasia, the ratio was 1/1.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Invasive carcinoma after atypical lobular hyperplasia is about three times more likely to arise in the breast diagnosed with atypical lobular hyperplasia than in the opposite breast without these initial findings. Our findings suggest a model of premalignancy for atypical lobular hyperplasia intermediate between a local precursor and a generalised risk for both breasts. See Commentary page 96",

        "Methods": "From October 1989 through October 1991, 266,064 women associated with 519 factories in Shanghai were randomly assigned to a BSE instruction group (132,979 women) or a control group (133,085 women). Initial instruction in BSE was followed by reinforcement sessions 1 and 3 years later, by BSE practice under medical supervision at least every 6 months for 5 years, and by ongoing reminders to practice BSE monthly. The women were followed through December 2000 for mortality from breast cancer. Cumulative risk ratios of dying from breast cancer were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 135 (0.10%) breast cancer deaths in the instruction group and 131 (0.10%) in the control group. The cumulative breast cancer mortality rates through 10 to 11 years of follow-up were similar (cumulative risk ratio for women in the instruction group relative to that in the control group = 1.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.82 to 1.33; P =.72). However, more benign breast lesions were diagnosed in the instruction group than in the control group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Intensive instruction in BSE did not reduce mortality from breast cancer. Programs to encourage BSE in the absence of mammography would be unlikely to reduce mortality from breast cancer. Women who choose to practice BSE should be informed that its efficacy is unproven and that it may increase their chances of having a benign breast biopsy.",

The other 141 women were presumed to be cancer free, as they were not identified by the State Cancer Registry. Six (2.6%) of the 233 women had a diagnosis of breast cancer in the area of the palpable abnormality.

Twenty-five breast masses were managed nonoperatively: chemotherapy was performed in three locally advanced breast cancers and 3-year follow-up was conducted for 22 benign lesions. Malignancies were correctly diagnosed in all cases. No malignancy was discovered at surgery or during clinical follow-up of ADH and no benign breast lesions were diagnosed by core needle biopsy.

For patients diagnosed with breast cancer, images and medical records were reviewed to determine whether the palpable lesion evaluated on sonography and mammography corresponded to the patient's breast cancer. On the basis of the number of breast cancers that correlated to the palpable areas imaged, the negative predictive value of sonography with mammography was determined.",
        "Results/Findings": "Sixty-two of the 420 patients in the study group were already diagnosed with breast carcinoma, and eight new carcinomas were diagnosed during the study period. Only one of six ipsilateral cancers corresponded to a palpable lesion that had a negative imaging evaluation. This lesion was diagnosed as an invasive lobular cancer, hard and fixed at physical examination. Imaging and clinical follow-up of the remaining patients showed no abnormality at the sites of previously investigated palpable abnormalities. The mean imaging follow-up was 25 months. The negative predictive value of sonography and mammography in the setting of a palpable lesion was 99.8%.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "At 18 institutions, 442 women who underwent 22-25-gauge imaging-guided FNAB were enrolled. Definitive surgical, core-needle biopsy, and/or follow-up information was available for 423 (95.7%) of these women. The reference standard was established from additional clinical and imaging information for an additional six (1.4%) women who did not undergo further histopathologic evaluation. The FNAB protocol was standardized at all institutions, and all specimens were reread by one of two expert cytopathologists.",
        "Results/Findings": "When insufficient samples were included in the analysis and classified as positive, the sensitivity and specificity of FNAB were 85%-88% and 55.6%-90.5%, respectively; accuracy ranged from 62.2% to 89.2%. The diagnostic accuracy of FNAB was significantly better for detection of masses than for detection of calcifications (67.3% vs. 53.8%, P =.006) and with US guidance than with stereotactic guidance (77.2% vs. 58.9%; P =.002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FNAB of nonpalpable breast lesions has limited value given the high insufficient sample rate and greater diagnostic accuracy of other interventions, including core-needle biopsy and needle-localized open surgical biopsy.",

        "Methods": "We evaluated both the goodness of fit of the Gail et al. model 2 that predicts the risk of developing invasive breast cancer specifically and its discriminatory accuracy at the individual level in the Nurses' Health Study. We began with a cohort of 82 109 white women aged 45-71 years in 1992 and applied the model of Gail et al. to these women over a 5-year follow-up period to estimate a 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "The model fit well in the total sample (ratio of expected [E] to observed [O] numbers of cases = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 0.99). Underprediction was slightly greater for younger women (<60 years), but in most age and risk factor strata, E/O ratios were close to 1.0. The model fit equally well (E/O ratio = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.99) in a subset of women reporting recent screening (i.e., within 1 year before the baseline); among women with an estimated 5-year risk of developing invasive breast cancer of 1.67% or greater, the E/O ratio was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.96 to 1.12). The concordance statistic, which indicates discriminatory accuracy, for the Gail et al. model 2 when used to estimate 5-year risk was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.56 to 0.60). Only 3.3% of the 1354 cases of breast cancer observed in the cohort arose among women who fell into age-risk strata expected to have statistically significant net health benefits from prophylactic tamoxifen use.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The Gail et al. model 2 fit well in this sample in terms of predicting numbers of breast cancer cases in specific risk factor strata but had modest discriminatory accuracy at the individual level. This finding has implications for use of the model in clinical counseling of individual women.",

        "Results/Findings": "Randomization achieved virtually equal distribution of demographic and breast cancer risk variables. At the first annual screen, 21% of the cancers found by mammography alone (in the mammography plus physical examination group) were 20 mm or more in size compared with 46% of those found by physical examination in the mammography plus physical examination group and 56% in the physical examination-only group. The corresponding percentages for screens 2-5 were 10%, 42%, and 50%, respectively. Screening detected 267 invasive breast cancers in the mammography plus physical examination group compared with 148 in the physical examination-only group. By December 31, 1993, 622 invasive and 71 in situ breast carcinomas were ascertained in the mammography plus physical examination group, and 610 and 16 were ascertained in the physical examination-only group. At 13-year follow-up, with 107 and 105 deaths from breast cancer in the respective groups, the cumulative rate ratio was 1.02 (95% confidence interval = 0.78-1.33).",

Women were eligible for the study if they had been diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer within 24 months of a screening mammogram and before a subsequent one. Interval cancer case subjects (n = 149) were women whose breast cancer occurred after a negative or benign mammographic assessment. Screen-detected control subjects (n = 388) were diagnosed after a positive screening mammogram. One radiologist, who was blinded to cancer status, assessed breast density by use of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mammographic sensitivity (i.e., the ability of mammography to detect a cancer) was 80% among women with predominantly fatty breasts but just 30% in women with extremely dense breasts. The odds ratio (OR) for interval cancer among women with extremely dense breasts was 6.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.95-19.4), compared with women with extremely fatty breasts, after adjustment for age at index mammogram, menopausal status, use of hormone replacement therapy, and body mass index. When only those interval cancer cases confirmed by retrospective review of index mammograms were considered, the OR increased to 9.47 (95% CI = 2.78-32.3).",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 157 solid tumors (observed/expected ratio [O/E] = 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 8.2.) and 26 acute leukemias (O/E = 27.4; 95% CI, 17.9 to 40. 2) were reported. Risk of solid tumors remained significantly increased among 20-year survivors (O/E = 6.6, observed [O] = 40, cumulative risk = 6.5%) and persisted for 25 years (O/E = 4.6, O = 15, cumulative risk = 11.7%). Temporal trends for cancers of thyroid, female breast, bone/connective tissue, stomach, and esophagus were consistent with the late effects of radiotherapy. Greater than 50-fold increased risks were observed for tumors of the thyroid and respiratory tract (one lung and one pleura) among children treated before age 10. At older ages (10 to 16 years), the largest number of second cancers occurred in the digestive tract (O/E = 19.3) and breast (O/E = 22.9). Risk of solid tumors increased with decreasing age at HD on a relative but not absolute scale.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Children and adolescents treated for HD experience significantly increased risks of second cancers at various sites for 2 to 3 decades. Although our results reflect the late effects of past therapeutic modalities, they underscore the importance of lifelong follow-up of pediatric HD patients given early, more aggressive treatments.",

        "Results/Findings": "Management recommendations for complex cysts were 1-year follow-up in 13 patients, 6-month follow-up in 148, sonographically guided aspiration in 82, aspiration with possible core biopsy in 62, and excisional biopsy in three. No malignancies were diagnosed in the group treated with follow-up imaging, sonographically guided aspiration, or excisional biopsy. One malignancy, a papilloma with a 3-mm focus of ductal carcinoma in situ, was diagnosed in one of the patients who underwent core biopsy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Of the lesions classified as complex cysts, the malignancy rate was 0.3% (1/308). This malignancy rate is lower than that for lesions classified as probably benign using mammographic criteria (i.e., for lesions classified as category 3 lesions using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System). Because the accepted standard practice for management of probably benign lesions is follow-up studies, the low yield of malignancy in this series suggests that complex cysts can be managed with follow-up imaging studies instead of intervention.",

        "Results/Findings": "In 6113 asymptomatic women, 23 malignancies in 21 patients were detected with sonography only (prevalence, 0.31%). Five additional malignant lesions were found in patients with a malignant (n = 3) or a benign (n = 2) palpable or mammographically detected index lesion. The mean size of invasive malignancies detected only by sonography was 9.1 mm, which was not significantly different from the mean size of invasive cancers detected by mammography (p = .07). The sensitivity of the prospective sonographic classification for malignancy was 100%, and the specificity was 33.5%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The use of high-resolution sonography as an adjunct to mammography in women with dense breasts may lead to detection of a significant number of otherwise occult malignancies that are no different in size from nonpalpable mammographically detected lesions.

Thirty-six biopsy sites with marker clips were excised surgically and examined; 18 of these marker clips were targets for wire localization. The locations of 22 benign lesions were measured over time to calibrate the measurement system.",
        "Results/Findings": "Baseline variability was 8 mm. Initial marker clip deployment averaged 5 mm above baseline from the center of the target lesion (P < or = .01). Compared with baseline variability, marker clips remained in place from initial deployment to first imaging follow-up (mean, 8.6 months). Potentially clinically meaningful misplacement rates (deployment > 24 mm from target lesion center) were 7% for the through-probe method and 11% for the straight-needle method (not significantly different; P = .33).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The marker clips appear to be useful targets for wire localization when the entire target lesion is removed at directional, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Upright, two-view mammography is recommended after deployment of the marker clip to document location.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Ninety-six axillary abnormalities seen mammographically in 94 patients were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the clinical diagnoses and pathologic results found in the medical records. For each abnormality, the length, margins, and presence of microcalcifications were noted. Logistic regression was used to determine an association between these findings and status (benign or malignant).",
        "Results/Findings": "Seventy-six of 94 patients had lymphadenopathy. Eighteen of 94 patients had an abnormality other than lymphadenopathy. Because two of these 94 patients had more than one abnormality, a total of 96 abnormalities occurred, 20 of which were due to an abnormality other than lymphadenopathy. Regarding the 76 cases of lymphadenopathy, the most frequent diagnosis was nonspecific benign lymphadenopathy in 29% (n = 22) of cases, followed by metastatic breast cancer in 26% (n = 20) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma in 17% (n = 13). Other causes (n = 21) included collagen vascular disease, lymphomas other than well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, metastatic disease from nonbreast primary site, metastatic disease from unknown primary site, sarcoidosis. HIV-related lymphadenopathy, and reactive lymphadenopathy associated with a breast abscess. An association between length of nonfatty lymph nodes and malignant status was statistically significant at the .001 level. When a length greater than 33 mm was used as a predictor of malignancy, the specificity and sensitivity were 97% and 31%, respectively. We found an association between malignancy and nonfatty lymph nodes with ill-defined or spiculated margins (p = .053). Regarding the 20 abnormalities other than lymphadenopathy, epidermal cysts (n = 7) were most prevalent.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The most common axillary abnormality revealed on mammography was abnormal lymph nodes. Homogeneously dense (nonfatty) axillary lymph nodes were strongly associated with malignancy when the lymph nodes were longer than 33 mm, had ill-defined or spiculated margins, or contained intranodal microcalcifications. However, our study confirmed that in most cases benign and malignant lymph nodes cannot be distinguished from each other mammographically.",

        "Methods": "The Late Effects Study Group followed a cohort of 1380 children with Hodgkin's disease to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and the risk factors associated with them.",
        "Results/Findings": "In this cohort, there were 88 second neoplasms as compared with 4.4 expected in the general population (standardized incidence ratio, 18.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 14.3 to 22.3). The estimated actuarial incidence of any second neoplasm 15 years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was 7.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.2 to 8.8 percent); the incidence of solid tumors was 3.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 5.5 percent). Breast cancer was the most common solid tumor (standardized incidence ratio 75.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 118.4), with an estimated actuarial incidence in women that approached 35 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 52.6 percent) by 40 years of age. Older age (10 to 16 vs. <10 years) at the time of radiation treatment (relative risk, 1.9) and a higher dose (2000 to 4000 vs. <2000 cGy) of radiation (relative risk, 5.9) were associated with significantly increased risk of breast cancer. The estimated actuarial incidence of leukemia reached a plateau of 2.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 4.8 percent) 14 years after diagnosis. Treatment with alkylating agents, older age at the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, recurrence of Hodgkin's disease, and a late stage of disease at diagnosis were risk factors for leukemia.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The risk of solid tumors, especially breast cancer, is high among women who were treated with radiation for childhood Hodgkin's disease. Systematic screening for breast cancer could be important in the health care of such women.",

        "Results/Findings": "To evaluate the risk of breast cancer from irradiation, we reviewed records of 885 women treated for Hodgkin's disease between 1961 and 1990 (mean follow-up, 10 years). Risks for breast cancer incidence and mortality were calculated by comparison with expected rates for a general female population matched by age and race.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Twenty-five patients have developed invasive breast cancer, yielding a relative risk (RR) of 4.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5-5.7). An additional patient developed multifocal carcinoma in situ. Age at irradiation strongly influenced risk: RR was 136 for women treated before 15 years of age (95% CI = 34-371). RR declined with age at irradiation (P for trend < .0001), but the elevation remained statistically significant for subjects less than 30 years old at the time of irradiation (for those 15-24, RR = 19 [95% CI = 10.3-32]; for those 24-29, RR = 7 [95% CI = 3.2-14.4]). In women above 30 years of age, the risk was not elevated (RR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.2-1.8). Risk of breast cancer increased significantly with time since treatment (P for trend < .0001). The RR was 2.0 (95% CI = 1.0-3.5) with follow-up under 15 years and 13.6 (95% CI = 7.9-18.2) with follow-up equal to or exceeding 15 years. The addition of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone chemotherapy to irradiation increased the risk within the first 15 years. Most breast cancers (22 of 26) arose within or at the margin of the radiation field and were infiltrating ductal carcinomas. Stage distribution and outcome suggest that the increased incidence was not solely attributable to vigilant screening. RR of death from breast cancer was 5.1 (95% CI = 2.2-10.0).",

Intraductal spreading of carcinoma was detected in 8 of 16 segmentectomy specimens. Six of eight patients with intraductal spreading had residual DCIS. The other two patients had atypical hyperplasia in breasts. No residual DCIS was detected in the other eight patients without intraductal spreading.

        "Results/Findings": "The median age at diagnosis of HD was 27 years (range, 11 to 60). All patients received radiotherapy (RT) to the upper part of their body, and 10 also had chemotherapy for HD. The median interval from the treatment of HD to the diagnosis of BC was 15 years (range, 8 to 34). The median age at diagnosis of BC was 43 years (range, 27 to 75), 41% of patients were 39 years old or younger. Most mammograms (81%) showed abnormal findings of mass and/or microcalcifications. Of the eight patients (22%) with bilateral tumors, four were synchronous and four were metachronous. Involvement of the medial half of the breast occurred more frequently than in patients with primary BC (39% and 21%, respectively; P < .002). But, the histologic types, grades, presence of lymphocytic reaction, and lymphatic invasion were similar to those observed in 935 primary BC patients who were previously analyzed at our center. The 6-year actuarial relapse-free survival (RFS) for node-negative BC after HD was 85%. Node-positive patients had a significantly lower RFS of 33% (P = .002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In comparison to patients with primary BC, patients who develop BC after HD are more likely to be younger, have bilateral disease, and have their tumors more frequently involve the medial half of the breast. Pathologic characteristics, nodal involvement, and prognosis are similar to those of primary BC. BC in women who were treated for HD is becoming an increasing problem, as more patients cured of HD reach a follow-up time of 10 to 15 years. Breast examination and mammography at an early age should be part of the follow-up program for women who are cured of HD.",
