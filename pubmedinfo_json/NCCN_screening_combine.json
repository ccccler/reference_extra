        "Background/Purpose": "Mammographic breast density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer and appears to be modifiable. However, whether longitudinal changes in density are associated with breast cancer risk is unknown. We hypothesize that decreases in breast density are associated with reduced breast cancer risk.",
        "Methods": "The Mayo Mammography Health Study cohort enrolled 19,924 women having a screening mammogram (mgm) at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, between 2003 and 2006. Participants were 35 years and older, had no prior breast cancer and lived in the tri-state area (MN, IA and WI). Risk factor data were collected through self-administered questionnaire and clinic databases. Incident breast cancers were identified through tumor registries (Mayo Clinic, MN, IA, WI). The BI-RADS, 4-category clinical density measure (fatty, scattered density, heterogeneous density and extreme density) was available on all mgms performed after 1996. A case-cohort design consisting of incident cases (n=241) and a random selection of the cohort (n=2300, 28 developed cancer) was used to examine the association between change in BI-RADS density and breast cancer. BI-RADS densities measured from the earliest available, and enrollment mgms (average 6 years apart) were used to assess density change. Proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) associated with a change in one or more BI-RADS density categories over time, relative to staying within the same category. Age was used as the time scale, and the subcohort was weighted by the inverse of the sampling proportion. Analyses were adjusted for age, years between mgms, BI-RADS density at earliest mgm, and changes in BMI, postmenopausal hormone use, and menopausal status.",
        "Results/Findings": "Longitudinal analyses were conducted on the 219 cases and 1900 non-cases in the subcohort with at least one mgm available prior to enrollment mgm. Compared to the subcohort, cases were older (56.8 vs. 52.9 years), more likely postmenopausal (73.4% vs. 61.6%), had higher BMI (29.0 vs 28.1) and were more frequently screened (8.0 vs. 6.9 pre-enrollment mgms). As expected, cases were more likely to have extreme density (BI-RADS=4) at earliest mgm than non-cases (16.2% vs 14.3%). Cases were less likely than non-cases to experience a reduction of one density category or more (37.0% vs 38.6%) following earliest mgm. Adjusting for potential confounders, women who decreased one BI-RADS category or more over an average 6 years were at reduced risk of breast cancer (HR=0.72, 95%CI: 0.50-0.99) compared to those whose density was unchanged. However, women who increased one or more BI-RADS categories had suggestion of increased risk (HR=1.52, 95%CI: 0.97-2.4).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Women with a decrease in BI-RADS density category over 6 years may have decreased breast cancer risk relative to women whose breast density category remains stable. Two measures of breast density may inform women's risk beyond a measure at one point in time.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Though simple cysts are easily identified using sonography, description and management of nonsimple cysts remains uncertain. This study evaluated whether the correlation coefficient differences&#10;between breast tissue and lesions, obtained from 2D breast elastography, could potentially distinguish&#10;non-simple cysts from cancers and fibroadenomas. We hypothesized that correlation coefficients in&#10;cysts would be dramatically lower than surrounding tissue because noise, imaging artifacts, and&#10;particulate matter move randomly and decorrelate quickly under compression, compared with solid&#10;tissue. For this preliminary study, 18 breast lesions (7 non-simple cysts, 4 cancers, and 7&#10;fibroadenomas) underwent imaging with 2D elastography at 7.5 MHz through a TPX (a polymethyl&#10;pentene copolymer) 2.5 mm mammographic paddle. Breasts were compressed similar to&#10;mammographic positioning and then further compressed for elastography by 1–7%. Images were&#10;correlated using 2D phase-sensitive speckle tracking algorithms and displacement estimates were&#10;accumulated. Correlation coefficient means and standard deviations were measured in the lesion and&#10;adjacent tissue, and the differential correlation coefficient (DCC) was introduced as the difference&#10;between these values normalized to the correlation coefficient of adjacent tissue. Mean DCC values&#10;in non-simple cysts were 24.2 ± 11.6%, 5.7 ± 6.3% for fibroadenomas, and 3.8 ± 2.9 % for cancers&#10;(p < 0.05). Some of the cysts appeared smaller in DCC images than grayscale images. These&#10;encouraging results demonstrate that characterization of non-simple breast cysts may be improved&#10;by using DCC values from 2D elastography, which could potentially change management options&#10;of these cysts from intervention to imaging follow-up. A dedicated clinical trial to fully assess the&#10;efficacy of this technique is recommended.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2020) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2021). In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015-2019 by 0.6%-1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%-3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus-associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%-2% annually for cervical (ages 30-44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late-1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two-fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Palpable masses in women are the most common symptom associated with breast cancer. This document reviews and evaluates the current evidence for imaging recommendations of palpable masses in women less than 30 to over 40 years of age. There is also a review of several different scenarios and recommendations after initial imaging. Ultrasound is usually the appropriate initial imaging for women under 30 years of age. If ultrasound findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 4 or 5), it is usually appropriate to continue with diagnostic tomosynthesis or mammography with image-guided biopsy. No further imaging is recommended if the ultrasound is benign or negative. The patient under 30 years of age with a probably benign ultrasound may undergo further imaging; however, the clinical scenario plays a role in the decision to biopsy. For women between 30 to 39 years of age, ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound are usually appropriate. Diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis are the appropriate initial imaging for women 40 years of age or older, as ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a negative mammogram within 6 months of presentation or immediately after mammography findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. If the diagnostic mammogram, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound findings are probably benign, no further imaging is necessary unless the clinical scenario indicates a biopsy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We present an overview of the risks and health complications associated with breast implant surgery with a focus on breast implant illness (BII), breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), and breast implant-associated squamous cell carcinoma (BIA-SCC). BII is a constellation of systemic symptoms that can occur after breast implant devices are surgically implanted into the human body. BIA-ALCL is a T-cell lymphoma associated with the implantation of textured breast implant devices. BIA-SCC is a potentially aggressive epithelial-based tumor that can occur following implantation with smooth or textured breast implant devices. Nurses may lack awareness and knowledge regarding BII, BIA-ALCL, and BIA-SCC, and this can negatively affect patient safety. Therefore, it is essential that all nurses, especially members of the plastic and aesthetic nursing community, understand these disease processes. Currently, it is not standard practice to screen every patient for the presence of an implantable device at every health care encounter. However, by not doing so, health care professionals may miss the opportunity to identify illness, disease, or cancer that could be related to an implanted device; therefore, practice changes to increase patient safety are both necessary and warranted. To identify those individuals at greatest risk for implant-related illness, disease, or cancer, we propose implementing universal screening of all individuals for implantable devices. We define universal screening for implantable devices as assessing all patients for the presence or absence of an implantable device at every health care encounter. We recommend using the IOWA model to guide our proposed evidence-based practice update.",

Distinguishing patients with physiologic versus pathologic nipple discharge, and treating the later according to the underlying pathologic condition is of utmost importance. Nipple discharge is categorized as lactational, physiologic, or pathologic. Physiologic nipple discharge (galactorrhea) is typically caused by hyperprolactinemia due to medications (ie, antipsychotics), pituitary tumors, and endocrine disorders. When a suspicious radiologic lesion is identified, pathologic assessment of the lesion is indicated. Patients with pathologic nipple discharge should be referred to a breast surgeon for definitive treatment and follow-up.",

        "Background/Purpose": "This article is the American Cancer Society's update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including population-based data on incidence, mortality, survival, and mammography screening. Breast cancer incidence rates have risen in most of the past four decades; during the most recent data years (2010-2019), the rate increased by 0.5% annually, largely driven by localized-stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, breast cancer mortality rates have declined steadily since their peak in 1989, albeit at a slower pace in recent years (1.3% annually from 2011 to 2020) than in the previous decade (1.9% annually from 2002 to 2011). In total, the death rate dropped by 43% during 1989-2020, translating to 460,000 fewer breast cancer deaths during that time. The death rate declined similarly for women of all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom the rates were stable. However, despite a lower incidence rate in Black versus White women (127.8 vs. 133.7 per 100,000), the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality remained unwavering, with the death rate 40% higher in Black women overall (27.6 vs. 19.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2016-2020) and two-fold higher among adult women younger than 50 years (12.1 vs. 6.5 deaths per 100,000). Black women have the lowest 5-year relative survival of any racial/ethnic group for every molecular subtype and stage of disease (except stage I), with the largest Black-White gaps in absolute terms for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative disease (88% vs. 96%), hormone receptor-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease (78% vs. 86%), and stage III disease (64% vs. 77%). Progress against breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by mitigating racial disparities through increased access to high-quality screening and treatment via nationwide Medicaid expansion and partnerships between community stakeholders, advocacy organizations, and health systems.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Two dimensional (2D) full-field digital mammography is the current standard of breast cancer screening. Digital breast tomosynthesis generates pseudo-three dimensional datasets of the breast from which synthesised 2D (s2D) mammograms can be reconstructed. This innovative approach reduces the likelihood of overlapping breast tissues that can conceal features of malignancy. We aimed to compare digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography with digital screening mammography for the detection of invasive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "TOSYMA was a randomised, open-label, superiority trial done at 17 screening units in two federal states of Germany. Eligible participants were women aged 50-69 years who had been invited to participate in a population-wide, quality-controlled mammography screening programme. Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography or digital mammography alone using block randomisation (block size of 32), stratified by site. The primary endpoints were the detection rate of invasive breast cancer and invasive interval cancer rate at 24 months, analysed in the modified full analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who underwent either type of screening examination. Ten examinations, corresponding to a second study participation, were excluded. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Interval cancer rates will be reported in the follow-up study. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, which included all participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is closed to accrual.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between July 5, 2018, and Dec 30, 2020, 99 689 women were randomly assigned to digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography (n=49 804) or digital mammography (n=49 830). Invasive breast cancers were detected in 354 of 49 715 women with evaluable primary endpoint data in the digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D group (detection rate 7·1 cases per 1000 women screened) and in 240 of 49 762 women in the digital mammography group (4·8 cases per 1000 women screened; odds ratio 1·48 [95% CI 1·25-1·75]; p<0·0001). Adverse events and device deficiencies were rare (six adverse events in each group; 23 device deficiencies in the digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D group vs five device deficiencies in the digital mammography group) and no serious adverse events were reported.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results from this study indicate that the detection rate for invasive breast cancer was significantly higher with digital breast tomosynthesis plus s2D mammography than digital mammography alone. Evaluation of interval cancer rates in the follow-up study will further help to investigate incremental long-term benefits of digital breast tomosynthesis screening.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The radiation dose associated with contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has been investigated only by single-center studies. In this retrospective study, we aimed to compare the radiation dose between two centers performing CEM within two prospective studies, using the same type of equipment. The CEM mean glandular dose (MGD) was computed for low energy (LE) and high energy (HE) images and their sum was calculated for each view. MGD and related parameters (entrance dose, breast thickness, compression, and density) were compared between the two centers using the Mann−Whitney test. Finally, per-patient MGD was calculated by pooling the two datasets and determining the contribution of LE and HE images. A total of 348 CEM examinations were analyzed (228 from Center 1 and 120 from Center 2). The median total MGD per view was 2.33 mGy (interquartile range 2.19−2.51 mGy) at Center 1 and 2.46 mGy (interquartile range 2.32−2.70 mGy) at Center 2, with a 0.15 mGy median difference (p < 0.001) equal to 6.2%. LE-images contributed between 64% and 77% to the total patient dose in CEM, with the remaining 23−36% being associated with HE images. The mean radiation dose for a two-view bilateral CEM exam was 4.90 mGy, about 30% higher than for digital mammography.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Background Adding digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) to digital mammography (DM) improves breast cancer screening sensitivity, but how this impacts mortality and other end points is unknown. Purpose To compare interval and overall breast cancer incidence after screening with DBT plus DM versus DM alone. Materials and Methods In this prospective trial (RETomo), women attending screening were randomized to one round of DBT plus DM (experimental arm) or to DM (control arm). All were then rescreened with DM after 12 months (women aged 45-49 years) or after 24 months (50-69 years). The primary outcome was interval cancer incidence. Cumulative incidence up to the subsequent screening round plus 9 months (21- and 33-month follow-up for women aged 45-49 and 50-69, respectively) was also reported. Ductal carcinomas in situ are included. Subgroup analyses by age and breast density were conducted; 95% CIs computed according to binomial distribution are reported. Results Baseline cancer detection was higher in the DBT plu DM arm than DM arm (101 of 13 356 women vs 61 of 13 521 women; relative detection, 1.7 [95% CI: 1.2, 2.3]). The mean age ± standard deviation for the women in both arms was 55 years ± 7. Interval cancer incidence was similar in the two arms (21 vs 22 cancers; relative incidence, 0.97 [95% CI: 0.53, 1.8]). Cumulative incidence remained higher in the DBT plus DM arm in women over 50 (153 vs 124 cancers; relative incidence, 1.2 [95% CI: 0.99, 1.6]), while it was similar in the two arms in women aged 45-49 (36 vs 41 cancers; relative incidence, 0.89 [95% CI: 0.57, 1.4]). Conclusion In women younger than 50 years, the benefit of early diagnosis seemed to be appreciable, while for women over age 50, the higher sensitivity of tomosynthesis plus mammography was not matched by a subsequent reduction in cancers at the next screening examination or in the intervening interval.

        "Background/Purpose": "Mammography remains the only validated screening tool for breast cancer, however, there are limitations to mammography. One of the limitations of mammography is the variable sensitivity based on breast density. Supplemental screening may be considered based on the patient's risk level and breast density. For average-risk women with nondense breasts, the sensitivity of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening is high; additional supplemental screening is not warranted in this population. For average-risk women with dense breasts, given the decreased sensitivity of mammography/DBT, this population may benefit from additional supplemental screening with contrast-enhanced mammography, screening ultrasound (US), breast MRI, or abbreviated breast MRI. In intermediate-risk women, there is emerging evidence suggesting that women in this population may benefit from breast MRI or abbreviated breast MRI. In intermediate-risk women with dense breasts, given the decreased sensitivity of mammography/DBT, this population may benefit from additional supplemental screening with contrast-enhancedmammography or screening US. There is strong evidence supporting screening high-risk women with breast MRI regardless of breast density. Contrast-enhanced mammography, whole breast screening US, or abbreviated breast MRI may be also considered.

The GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework was used to translate evidence to recommendations. A survivor information form was developed to counsel survivors about the potential harms and benefits of surveillance.",
        "Results/Findings": "The literature update identified new study findings related to the effects of prescribed moderate-dose chest radiation (10 to 19 Gy), radiation dose-volume, anthracyclines and alkylating agents in non-chest irradiated survivors, and the effects of ovarian function on breast cancer risk. Moreover, new data from prospective investigations were available regarding the performance metrics of mammography and magnetic resonance imaging among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. Modified recommendations include the performance of mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging for survivors treated with 10 Gy or greater chest radiation (strong recommendation) and upper abdominal radiation exposing breast tissue at a young age (moderate recommendation) at least annually up to age 60 years. As a result of inconsistent evidence, no recommendation could be formulated for routine breast cancer surveillance for survivors treated with any type of anthracyclines in the absence of chest radiation.",

Studies were reviewed by two authors independently according to eligibility and exclusion criteria and split into two subgroups (screening population studies and studies using cohorts enriched with known cancers) to avoid bias. Quality assessment and bias for diagnostic accuracy was determined with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The diagnostic accuracy for each subgroup was pooled using a bivariate random effects model and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves produced. Sensitivities and specificities were compared using a paired t-test.",

The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of SM, DM, SM with DBT, and DM with DBT for breast cancer detection.   A search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed for relevant articles published up to September 11, 2019. Studies included compared the diagnostic accuracy of SM versus DM and SM plus DBT versus DM plus DBT for breast cancer detection. Relevant study data metrics and risk of bias were assessed. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy (PROSPERO CRD42020150737).   Thirteen studies reporting on 201,304 patients (7252 patients with breast cancer) were included. The SM group (six studies: 20,728 patients, 724 with breast cancer) had 75% sensitivity (95% CI, 67-82%) and 92% specificity (95% CI, 85-96%). The DM group (nine studies: 52,082 patients, 2249 patients with breast cancer) had 73% sensitivity (95% CI, 65-80%) and 88% specificity (95% CI, 77-94%). The SM plus DBT group (10 studies, 64,224 patients, 2149 with breast cancer) had 85% sensitivity (95% CI, 80-89%) and 93% specificity (95% CI, 86-96%). The DM plus DBT group (nine studies, 64,270 patients, 2130 with breast cancer) had 84% sensitivity (95% CI, 80-88%) and 91% specificity (95% CI, 83-95%). Meta-regression models did not reveal significant differences in accuracy between the SM and DM groups (  = .25-.77).   SM and SM plus DBT showed comparable diagnostic accuracy to DM and DM plus DBT, respectively.   The findings support the implementation of SM in place of standard DM for mammographic imaging of the breasts. This may lead to an overall reduction in radiation exposure.",

Materials and Methods This randomized controlled trial comparing DBT+SM and DM was performed in Bergen as part of BreastScreen Norway, 2016-2017. Automated software measured density (Volpara Density Grade [VDG], 1-4). The outcomes were compared for DBT+SM versus DM by VDG in descriptive analyses. A stratified log-binomial regression model was used to estimate relative risk of outcomes in subgroups by screening technique. Results Data included 28 749 women, 14 380 of whom were screened with DBT+SM and 14 369 of whom were screened with DM (both groups: median age, 59 years; interquartile range [IQR], 54-64 years). The recall rate was lower for women screened with DBT+SM versus those screened with DM for VDG 1 (2.1% [81 of 3929] vs 3.3% [106 of 3212];   = .001) and VDG 2 (3.2% [200 of 6216] vs 4.3% [267 of 6280];   = .002). For DBT+SM, adjusted relative risk of recall (VDG 2: 1.8;   < .001; VDG 3: 2.4;   < .001; VDG 4: 1.8;   = .02) and screen-detected breast cancer (VDG 2: 2.4;   = .004; VDG 3: 2.8;   = .01; VDG 4: 2.8;   = .05) increased with VDG, whereas no differences were observed for DM (relative risk of recall for VDG 2: 1.3;   = .06; VDG 3: 1.1;   = .41; VDG 4: 1.1;   = .71; and relative risk of screen-detected breast cancer for VDG 2: 1.7;   = .13; VDG 3: 2.1;   = .06; VDG 4: 2.2;   = .15). Conclusion Screening with digital breast tomosynthesis combined with synthetic two-dimensional mammograms (DBT+SM) versus digital mammography (DM) yielded lower recall rates for women with Volpara Density Grade (VDG) 1 and VDG 2. Adjusted relative risk of recall and screen-detected breast cancer increased with denser breasts for DBT+SM but not for DM. © RSNA, 2020   See also the editorial by Sechopoulos and Athanasiou in this issue.",

As a consequence, rate of complications of breast biopsy and surgery like bleeding, infection, delayed healing and wound dehiscence is expected to be higher. Milk fistula is a rare event that may complicate surgery or needle biopsy of the breast in a breastfeeding woman, or in late stages of pregnancy . Suppression of lactation has been proposed in the literature as both a preventive and a therapeutic step. However, the advantages of nursing for both mother and child are numerous, and the author do not propose it as a preventive measure nor as a must in treatment of milk fistula.

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast imaging during pregnancy and lactation is challenging due to unique physiologic and structural breast changes that increase the difficulty of clinical and radiological evaluation. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is increasing as more women delay child bearing into the fourth decade of life, and imaging of clinical symptoms should not be delayed. PABC may present as a palpable lump, nipple discharge, diffuse breast enlargement, focal pain, or milk rejection. Breast imaging during lactation is very similar to breast imaging in women who are not breast feeding. However, breast imaging during pregnancy is modified to balance both maternal and fetal well-being; and there is a limited role for advanced breast imaging techniques in pregnant women. Mammography is safe during pregnancy and breast cancer screening should be tailored to patient age and breast cancer risk. Diagnostic breast imaging during pregnancy should be obtained to evaluate clinical symptoms and for loco-regional staging of newly diagnosed PABC. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.",

        "Methods": "A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis were undertaken. Electronic databases (2009-July 2017) were searched for studies comparing tomosynthesis and 2D mammography in asymptomatic women who attended population breast cancer screening and reporting cancer detection rate (CDR) and recall rate. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Seventeen studies (1 009 790 participants) were included from 413 citations. The pooled incremental CDR for tomosynthesis was 1.6 cancers per 1000 screens (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 2.0, P < .001, I2 = 36.9%). Incremental CDR was statistically significantly higher for European/Scandinavian studies, all using a \"paired\" design where women had both tests (2.4 per 1000 screens, 95% CI = 1.9 to 2.9, P < .001, I2 = 0.0%) compared with US (\"unpaired\") studies (1.1 per 1000 screens, 95% CI = 0.8 to 1.5, P < .001, I2 = 0.0%; P < .001 between strata). The recall rate for tomosynthesis was statistically significantly lower than for 2D mammography (pooled absolute reduction = -2.2%, 95% CI = -3.0 to -1.4, P < .001, I2 = 98.2%). Stratified analyses showed a decrease in US studies (pooled difference in recall rate = -2.9%, 95% CI = -3.5 to -2.4, P < .001, I2 = 92.9%) but not European/Scandinavian studies (0.5% increase in recall, 95% CI = -0.1 to 1.2, P = .12, I2 = 93.5%; P < .001 between strata). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses excluding studies with overlapping cohorts.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose To determine obligate overdiagnosis rates, defined as the percentage of women diagnosed with screen-detected breast cancer who die of causes other than breast cancer prior to clinical presentation of that cancer, for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive breast cancer, and all breast cancers. Materials and Methods Age-specific all-cause mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database, age-specific breast cancer incidence and mortality rates from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, and estimates of mean lead times and lead time distributions from breast cancer screening trials are used to estimate obligate (or type 1) overdiagnosis rates for DCIS, invasive breast cancer, and all breast cancers (DCIS plus invasive) for U.S. women undergoing screening mammography. Mortality rates by age are used to estimate the number of women who die of causes other than breast cancer during the lead time afforded by screening mammography. Resulting age-dependent overdiagnosis rates, along with screen-detected breast cancer incidence by age, are used to estimate type 1 overdiagnosis rates for the U.S. screening population. Results Obligate overdiagnosis rates depend strongly on the age at which a woman is screened, ranging from less than 1% at age 40 years to 30%, 21%, and 22.5% at age 80 years for DCIS, invasive breast cancer, and all breast cancers, respectively. Type 1 overdiagnosis rates among screened women in the United States are estimated to be 9% for DCIS and approximately 7% for both invasive breast cancer and all breast cancers. Screening of women ages 40-49 years (or premenopausal women, as determined from patient history, starting at age 40 years) adds little to obligate overdiagnosis rates (0.15% for DCIS and less than 0.1% for invasive breast cancer and all breast cancers). Conclusion Type 1 overdiagnosis rates increase rapidly with age at screening. Obligate overdiagnosis occurs in 9% of DCIS and approximately 7% of both invasive breast cancer and all breast cancers in the U.S. mammographic screening population, with screening of women ages 40-49 years (or premenopausal women starting at age 40 years) making a negligible contribution of 0.15% to obligate overdiagnosis of DCIS and a contribution of less than 0.1% to the obligate overdiagnosis rates of invasive breast cancer and all breast cancers.

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose To perform a preliminary evaluation of a noninvasive measurement system to assess gadolinium deposition in bone and to investigate the relationship between the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) and gadolinium retention in bone. Materials and Methods In vivo measurement of gadolinium retention in tibia bones was performed in 11 exposed subjects who previously received GBCAs (six exposed subjects were from a study performed 5 years previously involving injection of GBCAs in healthy volunteers; five exposed subjects had self-reported GBCA exposure), and 11 sex- and age-matched control subjects without a history of GBCA exposure. Each subject underwent one measurement of gadolinium retention in the tibia with x-ray fluorescence in a laboratory at McMaster University. A one-tailed t test was performed to compare gadolinium concentration in the exposed group with that in the control group. The relationship between the dose of GBCA administered and the gadolinium concentration measured in bone was analyzed with linear regression. Results Gadolinium concentration in bone was significantly higher in exposed subjects (mean, 1.19 μg Gd/g bone mineral ± 0.73 [standard deviation]) than in control subjects (mean, -1.06 μg Gd/g bone mineral ± 0.71) (P = .01). There was also a positive correlation between the dose of GBCA administered and the gadolinium concentration measured in bone (R  = 0.41); gadolinium concentration in bone increased by 0.39 μg Gd/g bone mineral ± 0.14 per 1 mL of GBCA administered. Gadolinium was detected in bone up to 5 years after one GBCA administration. Conclusion This x-ray fluorescence system is capable of measuring gadolinium deposition in bone noninvasively in vivo. Gadolinium can be retained in bone after one dose of GBCA in healthy subjects.   RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

Neuronal tissues from the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus were harvested and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and light microscopy to quantify, localize, and assess the effects of gadolinium deposition. Results Tissues from the four neuroanatomic regions of gadodiamide-exposed patients contained 0.1-19.4 μg of gadolinium per gram of tissue in a statistically significant dose-dependent relationship (globus pallidus: ρ = 0.90, P = .04). In contradistinction, patients in the control group had undetectable levels of gadolinium with ICP-MS. All patients had normal brain pathologic characteristics at autopsy. Three patients in the contrast group had borderline renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m ) and hepatobiliary dysfunction at MR examination. Gadolinium deposition in the contrast group was localized to the capillary endothelium and neuronal interstitium and, in two cases, within the nucleus of the cell. Conclusion Gadolinium deposition in neural tissues after GBCA administration occurs in the absence of intracranial abnormalities that might affect the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. These findings challenge current understanding of the biodistribution of these contrast agents and their safety.   RSNA, 2017.",

        "Methods": "A retrospective review of medical records from January 1994 to May 2014 identified 183 women who presented with a new diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum. MR images were available for 53 of these patients, all of whom were included in the study. Clinical history and available breast images were reviewed. The clinical impact of preoperative breast MRI was also recorded.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 53 women, nine (17%) presented during pregnancy and 44 (83%) presented during the first year postpartum. The sensitivity of MRI was 98% (52/53). Among the 53 patients, the most common findings of PABC on MRI included a solitary mass (29 patients [55%]), nonmass enhancement (12 patients [23%]), and multiple masses (eight patients [15%]). For 12 patients (23%), MRI showed a pathologically proven larger tumor size or greater extent of disease than did mammography or ultrasound, with an additional eight patients (15%) having findings suspicious for greater extent of disease but having unavailable pathologic data. Breast MRI changed surgical management for 15 patients (28%), with four patients (8%) requiring a larger lumpectomy, seven (13%) no longer being considered candidates for lumpectomy, two (4%) having contralateral disease, and two (4%) having unsuspected metastasis.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI had a high sensitivity for PABC in our study population. MRI may play an important role in PABC because it changed the surgical management of 28% of patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Population breast screening has been implemented in the UK for over 25 years, but the size of benefit attributable to such programmes remains controversial. We have conducted the first individual-based cohort evaluation of population breast screening in the UK, to estimate the impact of the NHS breast screening programme (NHSBSP) on breast cancer mortality.",
        "Methods": "We followed 988 090 women aged 49-64 years in 1991 resident in England and Wales, who because of the staggered implementation of the NHSBSP, included both invited subjects and an uninvited control group. Individual-level breast screening histories were linked to individual-level mortality and breast cancer incidence data from national registers. Risk of death from breast cancer was investigated by incidence-based mortality analyses in relation to intention to screen and first round attendance. Overdiagnosis of breast cancer following a single screening round was also investigated.",
        "Results/Findings": "Invitation to NHSBSP screening was associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality in 1991-2005 of 21% (RR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.73-0.84, P<0·001) after adjustment for age, socioeconomic status and lead-time. Breast cancer deaths among first invitation attenders were 46% lower than among non-attenders (RR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.51-0·57, P<0.001) and 32% lower following adjustment for age, socioeconomic status and self-selection bias (RR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.63-0·73, P<0.001). There was little evidence of overdiagnosis associated with invitation to first screen.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results indicate a substantial, statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality between 1991 and 2005 associated with NHSBSP activity. This is important in public health terms.",

        "Background/Purpose": "A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged <30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria  are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose To evaluate the early implementation of synthesized two-dimensional (s2D) mammography in a population screened entirely with s2D and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) (referred to as s2D/DBT) and compare recall rates and cancer detection rates to historic outcomes of digital mammography combined with DBT (referred to as digital mammography/DBT) screening. Materials and Methods This was an institutional review board-approved and HIPAA-compliant retrospective interpretation of prospectively acquired data with waiver of informed consent. Compared were recall rates, biopsy rates, cancer detection rates, and radiation dose for 15 571 women screened with digital mammography/DBT from October 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013, and 5366 women screened with s2D/DBT from January 7, 2015, to June 30, 2015. Two-sample z tests of equal proportions were used to determine statistical significance. Results Recall rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT was 7.1% versus 8.8%, respectively (P < .001). Biopsy rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT decreased (1.3% vs 2.0%, respectively; P = .001). There was no significant difference in cancer detection rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (5.03 of 1000 vs 5.45 of 1000, respectively; P = .72). The average glandular dose was 39% lower in s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (4.88 mGy vs 7.97 mGy, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Screening with s2D/DBT in a large urban practice resulted in similar outcomes compared with digital mammography/DBT imaging. Screening with s2D/DBT allowed for the benefits of DBT with a decrease in radiation dose compared with digital mammography/DBT.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The authors reviewed all diagnostic mammograms obtained during a 12-month interval before (two-dimensional [2D] mammography [June 2, 2010, to June 1, 2011]) and for 3 consecutive years after (tomosynthesis year 1 [2012], tomosynthesis year 2 [2013], and tomosynthesis year 3 [2014]) the implementation of tomosynthesis. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The rates of BI-RADS final assessment categories 1-5 were compared between the 2D and tomosynthesis groups. The positive predictive values after biopsy (PPV3) for BI-RADS category 4 and 5 cases were compared. The mammographic features (masses, architectural distortions, calcifications, focal asymmetries) of lesions categorized as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) and those for which biopsy was recommended (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) were reviewed. The χ(2) test was used to compare the rates of BI-RADS final assessment categories 1-5 between the two groups, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare all diagnostic studies categorized as BI-RADS 3-5. Results There was an increase in the percentage of cases reported as negative or benign (BI-RADS category 1 or 2) with tomosynthesis (58.7% with 2D mammography vs 75.8% with tomosynthesis at year 3, P < .0001). A reduction in the percentage of probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) final assessments also occurred (33.3% with 2D mammography vs 16.4% with tomosynthesis at year 3, P < .0001). Although the rates of BI-RADS 4 or 5 assessments did not change significantly with tomosynthesis (8.0% with 2D mammography vs 7.8% with tomosynthesis at year 3, P = .2), there was a significant increase in the PPV3 (29.6% vs 50%, respectively; P < .0001). These trends increased during the 3 years of tomosynthesis use. Conclusion Tomosynthesis in the diagnostic setting resulted in progressive shifts in the BI-RADS final assessment categories over time, with a significant increase in the proportion of studies classified as normal, a continued decrease in the rate of studies categorized as probably benign, and improved diagnostic confidence in biopsy recommendations.

With few exceptions, radiation exposure through radiography, computed tomography scan, or nuclear medicine imaging techniques is at a dose much lower than the exposure associated with fetal harm.

Generally, GBCAs are considered to have an excellent safety profile. However, GBCA administration has been associated with increased occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severely compromised renal function, and several studies have shown evidence of gadolinium deposition in specific brain structures, the globus pallidus and dentate nucleus, in patients with normal renal function.",
        "Methods": "Gadolinium deposition in the brain following repeated CE-MRI scans has been demonstrated in patients using T1-weighted unenhanced MRI and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Additionally, rodent studies with controlled GBCA administration also resulted in neural gadolinium deposits.",

In addition, the USPSTF reviewed comparative decision models on optimal starting and stopping ages and intervals for screening mammography; how breast density, breast cancer risk, and comorbidity level affect the balance of benefit and harms of screening mammography; and the number of radiation-induced breast cancer cases and deaths associated with different screening mammography strategies over the course of a woman's lifetime.",
        "Results/Findings": "This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 40 years or older who do not have preexisting breast cancer or a previously diagnosed high-risk breast lesion and who are not at high risk for breast cancer because of a known underlying genetic mutation (such as a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation or other familial breast cancer syndrome) or a history of chest radiation at a young age.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years. (B recommendation) The decision to start screening mammography in women prior to age 50 years should be an individual one. Women who place a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older.

        "Background/Purpose": "Mammography is not widely available in all countries, and breast cancer incidence is increasing. We considered performance characteristics using ultrasound (US) instead of mammography to screen for breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Two thousand eight hundred nine participants were enrolled at 20 sites in the United States, Canada, and Argentina in American College of Radiology Imaging 6666. Two thousand six hundred sixty-two participants completed three annual screens (7473 examinations) with US and film-screen (n = 4351) or digital (n = 3122) mammography and had biopsy or 12-month follow-up. Cancer detection, recall, and positive predictive values were determined. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "One hundred ten women had 111 breast cancer events: 89 (80.2%) invasive cancers, median size 12 mm. The number of US screens to detect one cancer was 129 (95% bootstrap confidence interval [CI] = 110 to 156), and for mammography 127 (95% CI = 109 to 152). Cancer detection was comparable for each of US and mammography at 58 of 111 (52.3%) vs 59 of 111 (53.2%, P = .90), with US-detected cancers more likely invasive (53/58, 91.4%, median size 12 mm, range = 2-40 mm), vs mammography at 41 of 59 (69.5%, median size 13 mm, range = 1-55 mm, P < .001). Invasive cancers detected by US were more frequently node-negative, 34 of 53 (64.2%) vs 18 of 41 (43.9%) by mammography (P = .003). For 4814 incidence screens (years 2 and 3), US had higher recall and biopsy rates and lower PPV of biopsy (PPV3) than mammography: The recall rate was 10.7% (n = 515) vs 9.4% (n = 453, P = .03), the biopsy rate was 5.5% (n = 266) vs 2.0% (n = 97, P < .001), and PPV3 was 11.7% (31/266) vs 38.1% (37/97, P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Cancer detection rate with US is comparable with mammography, with a greater proportion of invasive and node-negative cancers among US detections. False positives are more common with US screening.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The value of screen detection and treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a matter of controversy. At present, the extent to which the diagnosis and treatment of DCIS could prevent the occurrence of invasive breast cancer in the future is not clear. We sought to estimate the association between detection of DCIS at screening and invasive interval cancers subsequent to the relevant screen.",
        "Methods": "We obtained aggregate data for screen-detected cancers from 84 local screening units within 11 regional Quality Assurance Reference Centres in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. Data for DCIS diagnoses were obtained for women aged 50-64 years who were invited to and attended mammographic breast screening from April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007 (4 screening years). Patient-level data for interval cancer arising in the 36 months after each of these were analysed by Poisson regression with invasive interval cancer screen detection rate as the outcome variable; DCIS detection frequencies were fitted first as a continuous and then as a categorical variable. We repeated this analysis after adjustment with both small size and high-grade invasive screen-detected cancers.",
        "Results/Findings": "We analysed data for 5,243,658 women and on interval cancers occurring in the 36 months after the relevant screen. The average frequency of DCIS detected at screening was 1·60 per 1000 women screened (median 1·50 [unit range 0·54-3·56] [corrected to] per 1000 women). There was a significant negative association of screen-detected DCIS cases with the rate of invasive interval cancers (Poisson regression coefficient -0·084 [95% CI -0·13 to -0·03]; p=0·002). 90% of units had a DCIS detection frequency within the range of 1·00 to 2·22 per 1000 women; in these units, for every three screen-detected cases of DCIS, there was one fewer invasive interval cancer in the next 3 years. This association remained after adjustment for numbers of small screen-detected invasive cancers and for numbers of grade 3 invasive screen-detected cancers.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The association between screen-detected DCIS and subsequent invasive interval cancers suggests that detection and treatment of DCIS is worthwhile in prevention of future invasive disease.",

Included studies (7 reviews, 10 RCTs, 72 observational, 1 modeling) provided evidence on the association between screening with mammography, CBE, or both and prespecified critical outcomes among women at average risk of breast cancer (no known genetic susceptibility, family history, previous breast neoplasia, or chest irradiation). We used summary estimates from existing reviews, supplemented by qualitative synthesis of studies not included in those reviews.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Across all ages of women at average risk, pooled estimates of association between mammography screening and mortality reduction after 13 years of follow-up were similar for 3 meta-analyses of clinical trials (UK Independent Panel: relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.89]; Canadian Task Force: RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74-0.94]; Cochrane: RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87]); were greater in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.81]); and were comparable in a modeling study (CISNET; median RR equivalent among 7 models, 0.85 [range, 0.77-0.93]). Uncertainty remains about the magnitude of associated mortality reduction in the entire US population, among women 40 to 49 years, and with annual screening compared with biennial screening. There is uncertainty about the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with different screening strategies, attributable in part to lack of consensus on methods of estimation and the importance of ductal carcinoma in situ in overdiagnosis. For women with a first mammography screening at age 40 years, estimated 10-year cumulative risk of a false-positive biopsy result was higher (7.0% [95% CI, 6.1%-7.8%]) for annual compared with biennial (4.8% [95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%]) screening. Although 10-year probabilities of false-positive biopsy results were similar for women beginning screening at age 50 years, indirect estimates of lifetime probability of false-positive results were lower. Evidence for the relationship between screening and life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy was low in quality. There was no direct evidence for any additional mortality benefit associated with the addition of CBE to mammography, but observational evidence from the United States and Canada suggested an increase in false-positive findings compared with mammography alone, with both studies finding an estimated 55 additional false-positive findings per extra breast cancer detected with the addition of CBE.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.",

        "Background/Purpose": "As use of imaging in the evaluation of pregnant and lactating patients continues to increase, misperceptions of radiation and safety risks have proliferated, which has led to often unwarranted concerns among patients and clinicians. When radiologic examinations are appropriately used, the benefits derived from the information gained usually outweigh the risks. This review describes appropriateness and safety issues, estimated doses for imaging examinations that use iodizing radiation (ie, radiography, computed tomography, nuclear scintigraphy, and fluoroscopically guided interventional radiology), radiation risks to the mother and conceptus during various stages of pregnancy, and use of iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agents and radiotracers in pregnant and lactating women. Maternal radiation risk must be weighed with the potential consequences of missing a life-threatening diagnosis such as pulmonary embolus. Fetal risks (ie, spontaneous abortion, teratogenesis, or carcinogenesis) vary with gestational age and imaging modality and should be considered in the context of the potential benefit of medically necessary diagnostic imaging. When feasible and medically indicated, modalities that do not use ionizing radiation (eg, magnetic resonance imaging) are preferred in pregnant and lactating patients. Radiologists should strive to minimize risks of radiation to the mother and fetus, counsel patients effectively, and promote a realistic understanding of risks related to imaging during pregnancy and lactation.",

        "Methods": "Patients participating in surveillance after an LCIS diagnosis are observed in a prospectively maintained database. Comparisons were made among women choosing surveillance, with or without chemoprevention, and those undergoing bilateral prophylactic mastectomies between 1980 and 2009.",
        "Results/Findings": "One thousand sixty patients with LCIS without concurrent breast cancer were identified. Median age at LCIS diagnosis was 50 years (range, 27 to 83 years). Fifty-six patients (5%) underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy; 1,004 chose surveillance with (n = 173) or without (n = 831) chemoprevention. At a median follow-up of 81 months (range, 6 to 368 months), 150 patients developed 168 breast cancers (63% ipsilateral, 25% contralateral, 12% bilateral), with no dominant histology (ductal carcinoma in situ, 35%; infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 29%; infiltrating lobular carcinoma, 27%; other, 9%). Breast cancer incidence was significantly reduced in women taking chemoprevention (10-year cumulative risk: 7% with chemoprevention; 21% with no chemoprevention; P < .001). In multivariable analysis, chemoprevention was the only clinical factor associated with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.50). In a subgroup nested case-control analysis, volume of disease, which was defined as the ratio of slides with LCIS to total number of slides reviewed, was also associated with breast cancer development (P = .008).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We observed a 2% annual incidence of breast cancer among women with LCIS. Common clinical factors used for risk prediction, including age and family history, were not associated with breast cancer risk. The lower breast cancer incidence in women opting for chemoprevention highlights the potential for risk reduction in this population.",

Here, we report the results of the UK Age trial after 17 years of follow-up.",
        "Methods": "Women aged 39-41 from 23 UK NHS Breast Screening Programme units years were randomly assigned by individual randomisation (1:2) to either an intervention group offered annual screening by mammography up to and including the calendar year of their 48th birthday or to a control group receiving usual medical care (invited for screening at age 50 years and every 3 years thereafter). Both groups were stratified by general practice. We compared breast cancer incidence and mortality by time since randomisation. Analyses included all women randomly assigned who could be traced with the National Health Service Central Register and who had not died or emigrated before entry. The primary outcome measures were mortality from breast cancer (defined as deaths with breast cancer coded as the underlying cause of death) and breast cancer incidence, including in-situ, invasive, and total incidence. Because there is an interest in the timing of the mortality effect, we analysed the results in different follow-up periods. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN24647151.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 14, 1990, and Sept 25, 1997, 160 921 participants were randomly assigned; 53 883 women in the intervention group and 106 953 assigned to usual medical care were included in this analysis. After a median follow-up of 17 years (IQR 16·8-18·8), the rate ratio (RR) for breast cancer mortality was 0·88 (95% CI 0·74-1·04) from tumours diagnosed during the intervention phase. A significant reduction in breast cancer mortality was noted in the intervention group compared with the control group in the first 10 years after diagnosis (RR 0·75, 0·58-0·97) but not thereafter (RR 1·02, 0·80-1·30) from tumours diagnosed during the intervention phase. The overall breast cancer incidence during 17 year follow-up was similar between the intervention group and the control group (RR 0·98, 0·93-1·04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results support an early reduction in mortality from breast cancer with annual mammography screening in women aged 40-49 years. Further data are needed to fully understand long-term effects. Cumulative incidence figures suggest at worst a small amount of overdiagnosis.",

From these women, a reading dataset of 7060 cases was randomly allocated for independent blinded review of (a) 2D mammography images, (b) 2D mammography plus DBT images, and (c) synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT images. Reviewers had no access to results of previous examinations. Overall sensitivities and specificities were calculated for younger women and those with dense breasts.",

For patients aged 50-59 years old, sensitivity was significantly higher (P = .01) for 2D mammography plus DBT than it was for 2D mammography. For those with breast density of 50% or more, sensitivity was 86% for 2D mammography compared with 93% for 2D mammography plus DBT (P = .03). Specificity was 57% for 2D mammography, 70% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 72% for synthetic 2D mammography plusmDBT.

        "Methods": "Within a 15-month period, 67 patients with 92 breast lesions rated as Category IV or V according to the breast imaging reporting and data system detected with MG and/or ultrasound were included into the study. After the injection of 740-1110 MBq of Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) SestaMIBI intravenously, scintigrams were obtained in two projections comparable to MG. The BSGI was analysed visually and semi-quantitatively by calculating a relative uptake factor (X). With the exception of two patients with cardiac pacemakers, all patients underwent 3-T breast MRI. Biopsy results were obtained as the reference standard in all patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, accuracy and area under the curve were calculated for each modality.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among the 92 lesions, 67 (72.8%) were malignant. 60 of the 67 cancers of any size were detected by BSGI with an overall sensitivity of 90%, only exceeded by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 99%. The sensitivity of BSGI for lesions <1 cm declined significantly to 60%. Overall specificity of ultrasound was only 20%. Specificity, accuracy and positive-predictive value were the highest for BSGI (56%, 80% and 85%, respectively). X was significantly higher for malignant lesions (mean, 4.27) and differed significantly between ductal types (mean, 4.53) and the other histopathological entities (mean, 3.12).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Semi-quantitative BSGI with calculation of the relative uptake factor (X) can help to characterize breast lesions. BSGI negativity may obviate the need for biopsy of breast lesions >1 cm with low or intermediate prevalence for malignancy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The value of annual mammography remains an area of debate because of concerns regarding risk versus benefit. The potential for harm due to overdiagnosis and treatment of clinically insignificant cancers may not be captured by breast cancer-specific mortality. Instead, we examined all-cause mortality as a function of missed annual mammography examinations before breast cancer diagnosis.",
        "Methods": "Primary breast cancer cases diagnosed in the Marsh-field Clinic Health System from 2002 through 2008 were identified for retrospective review, and whether annual mammography examinations had been performed in the 5 years before diagnosis was assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Analyses were performed on 1421 women with breast cancer. After adjustment of data for age, comorbidity status, a family history of breast cancer, insurance status, medical encounter frequency, and the calendar year, women who had missed any of the previous five annual mammography examinations had a 2.3-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with subjects with no missed mammography examinations (hazard ratio=2.28; 95% CI, 1.58-3.30; p<0.0001). Additionally, an analysis by the number of missed annual mammography examinations showed a progressive increase in hazard as the number of missed mammography studies increased.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These results suggest that annual mammography before breast cancer diagnosis is predictive of increased overall survival. A stepwise decline in overall survival was noted for each additional missed mammography examination. These results are similar to findings in the literature for breast cancer-specific mortality and illustrate the importance of recommending annual mammography to all eligible women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To determine if the addition of screening breast ultrasound in women with mammographically normal but dense breasts improves breast cancer detection. The study utilized a retrospective chart review. Data collected included: (a) total number of screening mammograms; (b) total number of dense breast screening ultrasounds; (c) screening ultrasound Breast Imaging Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) code results; (d) biopsy results; and (e) demographic data on women with malignant biopsies. Data were obtained from sites throughout Connecticut from November 1, 2010 to October 31, 2011. Data from 5 Connecticut radiology practices covering 10 sites were collected. Sites conducted a total of 57,417 screening mammograms and 10,282 dense breast screening ultrasounds. Of the screening ultrasounds, 87% (8,972/10,282) were BI-RADS 1 or 2, 9% (875/10,282) were BI-RADS 3, 4% (435/10,282) were BI-RADS 4 or 5, and 39 were found to have a cancer or high-risk lesion on biopsy. This correlates to 3.8 cancers or high-risk lesions per 1,000 women screened. If high-risk lesions are excluded, there are 24 cases of biopsy proven malignancy corresponding to 2.3 cancers per 1,000 women screened. In this study, screening breast ultrasound in women with mammographically normal but dense breasts demonstrated a positive predictive value of 9% (39/435) and specificity of 96% (8,972/9,368). Based on the data collected from sites throughout Connecticut, screening breast ultrasound in women with dense breast parenchyma detects mammographically occult malignancy and high-risk lesions. The results are especially significant given recent studies suggesting that breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and that mammography is less effective in detecting cancer in dense breasts. The improved specificity and sensitivity between the 1st and 2nd years' suggests there is a learning curve that may continue to improve the results.",

        "Background/Purpose": "High-risk breast lesions, which comprise benign lesions and in situ carcinomas (lobular carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ), are clinically, morphologically, and biologically heterogeneous and are associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer development, albeit to varying degrees. Recognition and proactive management of such lesions can help to prevent progression to invasive disease, and might, therefore, reduce breast cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. However, this opportunity comes with the possibility of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, necessitating risk-based intervention. Notably, despite the progress in defining the molecular changes associated with carcinogenesis, alterations identifying the individuals with high-risk lesions that will progress to invasive carcinoma remain to be identified. Thus, until reproducible clinicopathological or molecular features predicting an individual's risk of breast cancer are found, management strategies must be defined by population-level risks as determined by models such as the Gail or IBIS models, as well as patient attitudes toward the risks and benefits of interventions. Herein, we review the contemporary approaches to diagnosis and management of high-risk breast lesions. Progress in this area will ultimately be dependent on the ability to individualize risk prediction through better definition of the key drivers in the carcinogenic process.",

IRB approved, HIPAA compliant study retrospectively reviewed 1,386 patients referred for breast imaging with ICD-9 code for breast pain between 1/1/2006 and 12/31/2007. Of these, 617 consecutive women (mean age, 49 years) with isolated breast pain, mammogram, and follow-up (mean, 51 months) constituted the study group. Clinical data, mammographic and sonographic BI-RADS assessments, and geographic relationship between the site of cancer and pain were evaluated. The frequency of malignancies and of specific benign outcomes, both at and subsequent to the time of presentation, was determined. Breast cancer and specific benign outcomes were diagnosed in the painful breast of 11/617 (1.8 %) and 63/617 (10.2 %) women, respectively. Majority of the cancers (9/11, 81.8 %) were diagnosed subsequent (5-52 months) to initial imaging evaluation, whereas the majority of benign outcomes (52/63, 82.5 %) were diagnosed at initial presentation. Diagnostic mammography at initial presentation had a negative predictive value of 99.8 % (95 % CI 99.1 %, 100 %), specificity of 98.5 % (95 % CI 97.2 %, 99.3 %), and sensitivity of 66.7 % (95 % CI 11.6 %, 94.5 %). Three cancers were subsequently diagnosed in the contralateral (non-painful) breast. Eleven of 14 (78.6 %) cancers were in the symptomatic breast, of which 9 (81.8 %) geographically corresponded to the same area of focal pain. Thus, infrequently, breast cancer may clinically present as or be preceded by isolated breast pain and diagnostic mammography is useful for assessment.",

From a total of 189 peer-reviewed publications on the performance of screening US, 12 studies were relevant to our analysis. The reporting of breast cancer risk factors varied across studies; however, the study populations tended to be at greater than average risk for developing breast cancer. Overall, US detected an additional 0.3-7.7 cancers per 1000 examinations (median, 4.2) and was associated with an additional 11.7-106.6 biopsies per 1000 examinations (median, 52.2). Significant improvements in cancer detection in dense breasts have been achieved with the transition from film to digital mammography. Thus adjunctive screening with ultrasound should be considered in the context of current screening mammography performance. Clinicians should discuss breast density as 1 of several important breast cancer risk factors, consider the potential harms of adjunctive screening, and arrive at a shared decision consistent with each woman's preferences and values.",

Its sensitivity, however, is 75% to 80% at best and reduced to 30% to 50% in women with dense breasts. MR imaging is a sensitive modality for the detection of breast cancer but cannot be used in all patients. Its sensitivity is due in large part to its ability to detect enhancement of tumor vascularity so cancers can be detected before a mass is present. Contrast-enhanced dual-energy mammography uses the same capability of vascular enhancement and has been demonstrated to be more sensitive than routine mammography.",

Standard double-reading by breast radiologists determined whether to recall the participant based on positive mammography at either screen read.

        "Results/Findings": "7292 women were screened (median age 58 years [IQR 54-63]). We detected 59 breast cancers (including 52 invasive cancers) in 57 women.

Cancer detection rates were 5.3 cancers per 1000 screens (95% CI 3.8-7.3) for 2D only, and 8.1 cancers per 1000 screens (6.2-10.4) for integrated 2D and 3D screening. The incremental cancer detection rate attributable to integrated 2D and 3D mammography was 2.7 cancers per 1000 screens (1.7-4.2). 395 screens (5.5%; 95% CI 5.0-6.0) resulted in false positive recalls: 181 at both screen reads, and 141 with 2D only versus 73 with integrated 2D and 3D screening (p<0.0001).

All but one of the screen-detected malignancies were preinvasive or subcentimeter node-negative breast cancers. After excluding first-screen MRI and mammogram, mammogram sensitivity was 68% as compared with 67% for MRI (P = 1.0). Sensitivity increased to 94% using both screening modalities. The specificities of mammogram alone, MRI alone, and both were 93%, 94%, and 90%, respectively.",

Analyses were based on marginal log-linear models for binary data, accounting for correlated interpretations and adjusting for reader-specific performance levels by using a two-sided significance level of .0294.",
        "Results/Findings": "Detection rates, including those for invasive and in situ cancers, were 6.1 per 1000 examinations for mammography alone and 8.0 per 1000 examinations for mammography plus tomosynthesis (27% increase, adjusted for reader; P = .001). False-positive rates before arbitration were 61.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography alone and 53.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography plus tomosynthesis (15% decrease, adjusted for reader; P < .001). After arbitration, positive predictive values for recalled patients with cancers verified later were comparable (29.1% and 28.5%, respectively, with mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis; P = .72). Twenty-five additional invasive cancers were detected with mammography plus tomosynthesis (40% increase, adjusted for reader; P < .001). The mean interpretation time was 45 seconds for mammography alone and 91 seconds for mammography plus tomosynthesis (P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The use of mammography plus tomosynthesis in a screening environment resulted in a significantly higher cancer detection rate and enabled the detection of more invasive cancers. Clinical trial registration no.  .",

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic value of one-view digital breast tomosynthesis versus two-view full-field digital mammography (FFDM) alone, and versus a combined reading of both modalities.",
        "Methods": "The datasets of one-view digital breast tomosynthesis and two-view FFDM of abnormal mammograms in 144 consecutive women admitted for diagnostic workup with clinical signs and symptoms (n = 78) or recalled from screening (n = 66) were read alone and in a combined setting. The malignant or benign nature of the lesions was established by histologic analysis of biopsied lesions or by 12-16-month follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "Eighty-six of the 144 patients were found to have breast cancer. The BI-RADS categories for one-view digital breast tomosynthesis were significantly better than those for two-view FFDM (p < 0.001) and were equal to those of the combined reading in both women admitted for diagnostic workup and women recalled from screening. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of digital breast tomosynthesis were superior to those of FFDM in fatty and dense breasts overall and in women admitted for diagnostic workup and in women recalled from screening. Only 11% of digital breast tomosynthesis examinations required additional imaging, compared with 23% of FFDMs.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients with abnormal mammograms, one-view digital breast tomosynthesis had better sensitivity and negative predictive value than did FFDM in patients with fatty and dense breasts. They also suggest that digital breast tomosynthesis would likely increase the predictive values if incorporated in routine screening.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To reduce mortality, screening must detect life-threatening disease at an earlier, more curable stage. Effective cancer-screening programs therefore both increase the incidence of cancer detected at an early stage and decrease the incidence of cancer presenting at a late stage.",
        "Methods": "We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease) and late-stage breast cancer (regional and distant disease) among women 40 years of age or older.",
        "Results/Findings": "The introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year, from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women--an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women. Concomitantly, the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8%, from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women--an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women. With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden, only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease. After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age, we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed (i.e., tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years. We estimated that in 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women; this accounted for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Despite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer. Although it is not certain which women have been affected, the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis, accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers, and that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.",

Mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal digital mammographic and tomosynthesis images of both breasts were obtained from 1192 subjects. Two enriched reader studies were performed to compare digital mammography with tomosynthesis against digital mammography alone. Study 1 comprised 312 cases (48 cancer cases) with images read by 12 radiologists; study 2, 312 cases (51 cancer cases) with 15 radiologists. Study 1 readers recorded only that an abnormality requiring recall was present; study 2 readers had additional training and recorded both lesion type and location. Diagnostic accuracy was compared with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Recall rates of noncancer cases, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values determined by analyzing Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scores were compared for the two methods.",
        "Results/Findings": "Diagnostic accuracy for combined tomosynthesis and digital mammography was superior to that of digital mammography alone. Average difference in area under the curve in study 1 was 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%, 10.8%; P < .001) and in study 2 was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.1%, 9.5%; P < .001). All 27 radiologists increased diagnostic accuracy with addition of tomosynthesis. Recall rates for noncancer cases for all readers significantly decreased with addition of tomosynthesis (range, 6%-67%; P < .001 for 25 readers, P < .03 for all readers). Increased sensitivity was largest for invasive cancers: 15% and 22% in studies 1 and 2 versus 3% for in situ cancers in both studies.",

The lesions in the cohort included 33% (72 of 217) cancers and 67% (145 of 217) benign lesions. Eighty-four percent (182 of 217) of the lesions were masses, 11% (25 of 217) were asymmetries, and 5% (10 of 217) were distortions that were initially detected at clinical examination in 8% (17 of 217), at mammography in 80% (173 of 217), at ultrasonography (US) in 11% (25 of 217), or at magnetic resonance imaging in 1% (2 of 217). Histopathologic examination established truth in 191 lesions, US revealed a cyst in 12 lesions, and 14 lesions had a normal follow-up. Each lesion was interpreted once with tomosynthesis and once with supplemental mammographic views; both modes included the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views in a fully crossed and balanced design by using a five-category Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and a probability-of-malignancy score. Differences between modes were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model for BI-RADS-based sensitivity and specificity and with modified Obuchowski-Rockette approach for probability-of-malignancy-based area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.",
        "Results/Findings": "Average probability-of-malignancy-based area under the ROC curve was 0.87 for tomosynthesis versus 0.83 for supplemental views (P < .001). With tomosynthesis, the false-positive rate decreased from 85% (989 of 1160) to 74% (864 of 1160) (P < .01) for cases that were rated BI-RADS category 3 or higher and from 57% (663 of 1160) to 48% (559 of 1160) for cases rated BI-RADS category 4 or 5 (P < .01), without a meaningful change in sensitivity. With tomosynthesis, more cancers were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (39% [226 of 576] vs 33% [188 of 576]; P = .017) without a decrease in specificity.",

Each area of concern was designated a study case. Benign versus malignant outcomes were determined by biopsy or imaging surveillance and through linkage with a tumor registry with a minimum 24-month follow-up. Overall cancer yield, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasound and mammography were calculated.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 1208 cases in 954 patients. Outcomes were benign in 1185 of 1208 (98.1%) and malignant in 23 of 1208 (1.9%) cases. Sensitivities for ultrasound and mammography were 95.7% and 60.9%, respectively. Specificities for ultrasound and mammography were 89.2% and 94.4%, respectively. NPV was 99.9% for ultrasound and 99.2% for mammography. PPV was 13.2% for ultrasound and 18.4% for mammography. Mammography detected one additional malignancy in an asymptomatic area in a 32-year-old woman who was subsequently found to have a BRCA2 gene mutation.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast imaging is warranted in women 30-39 years of age with focal signs or symptoms because of the small (1.9%) but real risk of malignancy.

We aimed to determine an estimate range for overdiagnosis of breast cancer in European mammographic service screening programmes.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a literature review of observational studies that provided estimates of breast cancer overdiagnosis in European population-based mammographic screening programmes. Studies were classified according to the presence and the type of adjustment for breast cancer risk (data, model and covariates used), and for lead time (statistical adjustment or compensatory drop). We expressed estimates of overdiagnosis from each study as a percentage of the expected incidence in the absence of screening, even if the variability in the age range of the denominator could not be removed. Estimates including carcinoma in situ were considered when available.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 13 primary studies reporting 16 estimates of overdiagnosis in seven European countries (the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, UK and Spain). Unadjusted estimates ranged from 0% to 54%.

The estimated breast cancer mortality reductions ranged from 1% to 9% per year in studies reporting an annual percentage change, and from 28% to 36% in those comparing post- and prescreening periods. In the IBM studies, the pooled mortality reduction was 25% (relative risk [RR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.81) among invited women and 38% (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.56-0.69) among those actually screened.

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Valid observational designs are those where sufficient longitudinal individual data are available, directly linking a woman's screening history to her cause of death. From such studies, the best 'European' estimate of breast cancer mortality reduction is 25-31% for women invited for screening, and 38-48% for women actually screened. Much of the current controversy on breast cancer screening is due to the use of inappropriate methodological approaches that are unable to capture the true effect of mammographic screening.",

Of 63 aspirations or biopsies recommended and performed in 53 patients, in nine, lesions were BI-RADS category 3, and in 54, lesions were BI-RADS category 4. Among 63 biopsies and aspirations, three lesions were malignant (all BI-RADS category 4, diagnosed with biopsy). All three cancers were smaller than 1 cm, were found in postmenopausal patients, and were solid masses. One cancer was found in each risk group. In 44 of 935 (4.7%) patients, examination results were false-positive. Overall positive predictive value (PPV) for biopsy or aspirations performed in patients with BI-RADS category 4 masses was 6.5% (three of 46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 19%).

Method of detection--patient detected (PtD), physician detected (PhysD), or mammography detected (MamD)--was chart abstracted. Disease-specific survival and relapse-free survival statistics were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method for stage I-IV breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "A significant increase in the percentage of MamD breast cancer over time (28%-58%) and a concurrent decline in patient and physician detected (Pt/PhysD) breast cancer (73%-42%) (Pearson x(2) = 72.72, P < .001) were observed over time from 1990 to 2008, with an overall increase in lower-stage disease detection and a decrease in higher-stage disease. MamD breast cancer patients were more likely to undergo lumpectomy (67% vs 48% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients) and less likely to undergo modified radical mastectomy (25% vs 47% of the Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients) (P < .001). Uncorrected for stage, 13% of MamD breast cancer patients underwent surgery and chemotherapy versus 22% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients (P < .001), and 31% of MamD breast cancer patients underwent surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy versus 59% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients (x(2) = 305.13, P < .001). Analyzing invasive cancers only, 5-year relapse-free survival for MamD breast cancer patients was 92% versus 88% for Pt/PhysD patients (log-rank test, 12.47; P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Increased mammography-detected breast cancer over time coincided with lower-stage disease detection resulting in reduced treatment and lower rates of recurrence, adding factors to consider when evaluating the benefits of mammography screening of women aged 40-49 years.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Introduction. Spontaneous nipple discharge is the third most common reason for presentation to a symptomatic breast clinic. Benign and malignant causes of spontaneous nipple discharge continue to be difficult to distinguish. We analyse our experience of duct excisions for spontaneous nipple discharge to try to identify features that raise suspicion of breast cancer and to identify features indicative of benign disease that would be suitable for nonoperative management. Methods. Details of one hundred and ninety-four patients who underwent duct excision for spontaneous nipple discharge between 1995 and 2005 were analysed. Results. Malignant disease was identified in 11 (5.7%) patients, 4 invasive and 7 insitu, which was 10.2% of those presenting with bloodstained discharge. All patients with malignant disease had bloodstained discharge. Discharge due to malignant disease was more likely to be bloodstained than that due to benign causes (Fisher's exact test, 2-tailed P value = 0.00134). Conclusion. Our findings do not support a policy of conservative management of spontaneous bloodstained nipple discharge. Cases of demonstrable spontaneous bloodstained nipple discharge should undergo duct excision to prevent malignant lesions being missed.",

Vaccination may cause transient inflammation of lymph nodes, which may induce false-positive findings on FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This study investigated the influence of influenza vaccination on FDG-PET/CT imaging in normal subjects.",
        "Methods": "Between November 2008 and March 2009, a total of 172 examinees underwent FDG-PET/CT during an annual cancer-screening program at our hospital, 83 of whom had a history of recent non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccination. They were asked the date and injection site of the vaccination. Examinees were divided into 2 groups based on the interval after vaccination using a cutoff value of 7 days (1 week). Two double board-certified nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists visually interpreted the FDG-PET/CT images with reference to PET/CT fusion and CT images and checked the location and the number of abnormal accumulations by consensus reading.",
        "Results/Findings": "Intervals between vaccination and FDG-PET were less than 7 days in 5 examinees, and 7 days or more in 78 examinees. Unexpected accumulations were visualized in 4 examinees in the axilla and medial upper arm, and all of them belonged to the group who underwent vaccination less than 7 days previously. In the second group there was no abnormal FDG accumulation.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Recent influenza vaccination before FDG-PET/CT examination may cause ipsilateral axillary lymph node accumulations, especially within several days after vaccination. Questionnaires about vaccination can help to avoid false interpretation of FDG avid axillary lymph nodes.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite the low likelihood of malignancy, it is recommended that all women with pathologic nipple discharge undergo duct excision based on the inadequate sensitivity of diagnostic modalities. However, these data originates prior to recent improvements in breast imaging. We performed a retrospective review of patients evaluated in the setting of modern diagnostic breast imaging. Of 175 women referred to our breast clinic with a primary complaint of nipple discharge, 142 (81%) had suspicious discharge. Of the 23 patients who opted for observation over duct excision, with a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, none have been diagnosed with cancer. Among patients who proceeded with surgery, cancer was diagnosed in seven patients (5%). Six of the seven patients had either an abnormal mammogram or ultrasound. Among 46 patients with suspicious nipple discharge, a normal physical exam and normal diagnostic mammogram/ultrasound, only one malignancy (2%) was identified in a 79-year-old patient with a personal history of breast cancer. In selected patients with suspicious nipple discharge, but normal physical exam and diagnostic imaging, short-term observation with repeat evaluation seems reasonable for patients who do not desire duct excision.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To determine if digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) performs comparably to mammographic spot views (MSVs) in characterizing breast masses as benign or malignant.",
        "Methods": "This IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant reader study obtained informed consent from all subjects. Four blinded Mammography Quality Standards Act-certified academic radiologists individually evaluated DBT images and MSVs of 67 masses (30 malignant, 37 benign) in 67 women (age range, 34-88 years). Images were viewed in random order at separate counterbalanced sessions and were rated for visibility (10-point scale), likelihood of malignancy (12-point scale), and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. Differences in mass visibility were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Reader performance was measured by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) and partial area index above a sensitivity threshold of 0.90 (A(z)(0.90)) by using likelihood of malignancy ratings. Masses categorized as BI-RADS 4 or 5 were compared with histopathologic analysis to determine true-positive results for each modality.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mean mass visibility ratings were slightly better with DBT (range, 3.2-4.4) than with MSV (range, 3.8-4.8) for all four readers, with one reader's improvement achieving statistical significance (P = .001). The A(z) ranged 0.89-0.93 for DBT and 0.88-0.93 for MSV (P ≥ .23). The A(z)((0.90)) ranged 0.36-0.52 for DBT and 0.25-0.40 for MSV (P ≥ .20). The readers characterized seven additional malignant masses as BI-RADS 4 or 5 with DBT than with MSV, at a cost of five false-positive biopsy recommendations, with a mean of 1.8 true-positive (range, 0-3) and 1.3 false-positive (range, -1 to 4) assessments per reader.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this small study, mass characterization in terms of visibility ratings, reader performance, and BI-RADS assessment with DBT was similar to that with MSVs. Preliminary findings suggest that MSV might not be necessary for mass characterization when performing DBT.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The surgical management of lobular in-situ neoplasia (LN) identified by core needle biopsy (CNB) is currently variable. Our institution has routinely excised LN on CNB since 2003, allowing for an unbiased assessment of upgrade rates.",
        "Methods": "Cases of LN on CNB, including atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma-in-situ (LCIS), were identified in our pathology database. CNBs with concurrent pleomorphic LCIS, ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma were excluded. Imaging indication/modality, biopsy indication, and radiologic concordance were determined. Pathology review included scoring total foci of LN in each CNB. Upgrade rates to invasive carcinoma or DCIS at excision were calculated.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 106 cases of LN (73 ALH and 33 LCIS) on CNB were identified. Thirty patients had concurrent atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and 76 had LN alone; 93 (88%) of the patients had available surgical follow-up (25 LN + ADH and 68 LN alone). The upgrade rate at excision was 16% (4 of 25) for LN + ADH and 4.4% (3 of 68) for LN alone. Patients with LN alone and discordant imaging, imaging for high-risk indications, or extensive LCIS (>4 foci) accounted for all the upgrades. Normal-risk patients who underwent biopsy to assess calcifications found by routine mammographic screening with LN alone did not result in upgrade.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Women with a CNB diagnosis of LN for calcifications found on routine, normal-risk mammographic screening have a negligible risk of upgrade and may not require excisional biopsy. However, excisional biopsy should be offered to women undergoing imaging for other indications or with >4 foci of LN on CNB.",

However, the absolute risk estimates for Asian and Pacific Islander American (APA) women are based on data from white women. We developed a model for projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk in APA women and compared its projections to those from BCRAT.",
        "Methods": "Data from 589 women with breast cancer (case patients) and 952 women without breast cancer (control subjects) in the Asian American Breast Cancer Study were used to compute relative and attributable risks based on the age at menarche, number of affected mothers, sisters, and daughters, and number of previous benign biopsies. Absolute risks were obtained by combining this information with ethnicity-specific data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and with US ethnicity-specific mortality data to create the Asian American Breast Cancer Study model (AABCS model). Independent data from APA women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were used to check the calibration and discriminatory accuracy of the AABCS model.",
        "Results/Findings": "The AABCS model estimated absolute risk separately for Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, and Other Asian women. Relative and attributable risks for APA women were comparable to those in BCRAT, but the AABCS model usually estimated lower-risk projections than BCRAT in Chinese and Filipino, but not in Hawaiian women, and not in every age and ethnic subgroup. The AABCS model underestimated absolute risk by 17% (95% confidence interval = 1% to 38%) in independent data from WHI, but APA women in the WHI had incidence rates approximately 18% higher than those estimated from the SEER program.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The AABCS model was calibrated to ethnicity-specific incidence rates from the SEER program for projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk and is preferable to BCRAT for counseling APA women.",

Examinations rated as BI-RADS categories 4 and 5 were considered positive. One hundred thirty-four (82%) of 164 lesions had pathology results available or longer than 12 months follow-up in our study group.

Mammograms were dense or heterogeneously dense in 88% of patients. All four malignancies were BI-RADS category 4 or 5 according to both mammography and ultrasound. For the 85 lesions evaluated with mammography, there was 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 40% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.

        "Background/Purpose": "We find anomalously high gadolinium (Gd) concentrations in the femoral head bones of patients exposed to chelated Gd, commonly used as a contrast agent for medical imaging. Gd is introduced in chelated form to protect patients from exposure to toxic free Gd(3+), a calcium antagonist which disrupts cellular processes. Recent studies suggest Gd chelates break down in vivo, and Gd accumulation in tissue is linked to medical conditions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), acute kidney failure, and in some cases death. We measure Gd and other rare earth element (REE) concentrations in 35 femoral heads by solution based ICP-MS. Gd concentrations in patients with documented exposure to Gd-based contrast agents (n = 13: Gd DTPA-BMA (Omniscan) n = 6; Gd HP-DO3A (Prohance) n = 5; unknown type n = 4) are significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the control group (n = 17). We use our control group to establish the 'natural' background level of Gd in human bone (cortical 95% CI: 0.023, 0.041 nmol/g; trabecular 95% CI: 0.054, 0.107 nmol/g). A control group outlier reveals the occurrence of individuals with high concentrations of all REEs, including Gd. Because of this, we calculate Gd anomalies from the concentrations of adjacent REEs and normalize to the control group mean to isolate Gd input from contrast agents. Normalized Gd anomalies, (Gd/Gd*)(N), for exposed patients range up to >800 times the 'natural' level (95% CI: 124, 460). Our data confirm that Gd, introduced in chelated form, incorporates into bone and is retained for more than 8 years. No difference was observed in bone Gd concentrations and anomalies between patients dosed with Gd DTPA-BMA (Omniscan; n = 6) and Gd HP-DO3A (Prohance; n = 5). Osteoporotic fracture patients exposed to Gd have significantly lower Gd concentrations than osteoarthritis patients (p < 0.001). This indicates different mechanisms of metal incorporation and/or retention in osteoporotic bone tissues, and may signal an increased risk of endogenous Gd release for patients with increased rates of bone resorption (e.g. osteoporosis patients and menopausal, pregnant, and lactating women) who are exposed to Gd-based contrast agents.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We aimed to quantitatively assess the effect of baseline breast density on the incidence, stage, and mortality, and also the natural course of the disease, considering the sensitivity of mammography to clarify its causal or masking effect.",
        "Methods": "In total, 15,658 women ages 45 to 59 years from the Kopparberg randomized controlled trial in Sweden were prospectively followed from 1977 until 2004 to ascertain breast cancer incidence and death. Dense breast tissue collected at the beginning of the study was defined as pattern IV or V by the Tabár classification. Conventional risk factors were also collected at baseline. The three-state Markov model was used to estimate the preclinical incidence rate and the mean sojourn time given the fixed sensitivity.",
        "Results/Findings": "Dense breast tissue was significantly associated with breast cancer incidence [relative risk (RR)=1.57 (1.18-1.67)] and with breast cancer mortality [RR=1.91 (1.26-2.91)] after adjusting for other risk factors. Cumulative incidence rates irrespective of nonadvanced and advanced breast cancer were higher in dense breast tissue compared with nondense tissue but no difference in survival was detected between dense and nondense breast tissue. Dense breast tissue had a higher preclinical incidence rate (causal effect) and shorter mean sojourn time (masking effect) compared with nondense breast tissue by controlling the sensitivity of mammography.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We corroborated the effect of baseline breast density with a higher incidence and mortality and also showed its contribution to a masking effect with long-term follow-up data.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The 2009 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis include significant updates for the role of MRI in screening women at increased risk for breast cancer. The NCCN now recommends considering breast MRI as an adjunct to annual mammography and clinical breast examination for women who have a BRCA1 or -2 mutation or who have a first-degree relative who has a BRCA1 or -2 mutation but who have not undergone genetic testing themselves; those who are determined to have a lifetime risk greater than 20% based on models that are highly dependent on family history; and those with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ. MRI is also recommended for patients who underwent radiation treatment to the chest between 10 and 30 years of age, and in those who carry or have a first-degree relative who carries a genetic mutation in the TP53 or PTEN genes (Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, and Bannahyan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes). MRI is specifically not recommended for screening women at average risk for breast cancer. This article describes the peer-reviewed, published clinical research trials evaluating breast MRI in high-risk patients, on which the NCCN guidelines were based, and provides suggestions for future research.",

Clinical characterization of these masses is often unreliable, and mammographic appearances alone cannot distinguish between those that are solid and those that are cystic. Sonography is an important adjunct to characterize these abnormalities further. Management of solid masses is well established, but overlap in appearance of cystic lesions has led to variability in reporting and management. With current high-resolution ultrasound, specific observations can accurately characterize most cystic masses, thereby facilitating management decisions.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Most women at very high risk of breast cancer because of a mutation in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, or a very strong family history of breast cancer, opt for intensive breast screening rather than bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Annual screening mammography has low sensitivity in this population in part because of the greater breast density and faster tumor growth of younger women, resulting in cancers being detected at a suboptimal stage. In 11 prospective comparative studies, the addition of annual contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast to mammography demonstrated more than 90% sensitivity, more than twice that of mammography alone. False-positive rates were higher with the addition of MRI, but specificity improved on successive rounds of screening. Although survival data are not yet available, the stage distribution of these tumors predicts a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality rate compared with that of screening without MRI. Accordingly, annual MRI plus mammography is now the standard of care for screening women aged 30 years or older who are known or likely to have inherited a strong predisposition to breast cancer (based on the above evidence) and for women who received radiation therapy to the chest before the age of 30 years (based on expert opinion). Further research is necessary to define the optimal screening schedule for different subgroups. Formal studies of other high-risk populations (eg, biopsy showing lobular neoplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia, dense breasts, and personal history of breast cancer at a young age) should be done before MRI screening is routinely adopted for these women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "There has been a substantial increase in the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy and lactation. Among some physicians and patients, however, there are misperceptions regarding risks, safety, and appropriate use of these modalities in pregnancy. We have developed a set of evidence-based guidelines for the use of CT, MRI, and contrast media during pregnancy for selected indications including suspected acute appendicitis, pulmonary embolism, renal colic, trauma, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Ultrasonography is the initial modality of choice for suspected appendicitis, but if the ultrasound examination is negative, MRI or CT can be obtained. Computed tomography should be the initial diagnostic imaging modality for suspected pulmonary embolism. Ultrasonography should be the initial study of choice for suspected renal colic. Ultrasonography can be the initial imaging evaluation for trauma, but CT should be performed if serious injury is suspected. Pelvimetry now is used rarely for suspected cephalopelvic disproportion, but when required, low-dose CT pelvimetry can be performed with minimal risk. Although iodinated contrast seems safe to use in pregnancy, intravenous gadolinium is contraindicated and should be used only when absolutely essential. It seems to be safe to continue breast-feeding immediately after receiving iodinated contrast or gadolinium. Although teratogenesis is not a major concern after exposure to prenatal diagnostic radiation, carcinogenesis is a potential risk. When used appropriately, CT and MRI can be valuable tools in imaging pregnant and lactating women; risks and benefits always should be considered and discussed with patients.",

Effects of mammography on disease stage (I to IIa v IIb to IV) and survival were determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "Percentages of women with nonuse, irregular use, and regular use of mammography during the 5 years preceding diagnosis were 49%, 29%, and 22%, respectively.

Breast cancer-specific 5-year survival among nonusers was 82%, that among irregular users was 88%, and that among regular users was 94%. However, survival from causes other than breast cancer was also associated with mammography use, suggesting a bias for healthier patients to undergo mammography.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Regular mammography among women >or= 80 years of age was associated with earlier disease stage, although improved survival remains difficult to demonstrate.

It is important to differentiate RS from concomitant malignancies, which occur in 20-30% of patients, or from small stellate carcinomas which give similar radiomorphology. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectivity of current breast diagnostic methods in distinguishing between real RS, concomitant malignancy and carcinomas imitating RS. Diagnosis of RS was set up in 61 cases by mammography. Forty-four patients underwent surgical excision: histology showed benign or malignant lesions in 28 and 16 cases, respectively. A series of negative results at follow-up proved the benign nature of the lesion in further 11 cases. Six patients were not available for follow-up. Results of mammography, physical examination, ultrasonography and cytology were evaluated and were compared in 39 benign and 16 malignant cases. Results of examinations were reported on the BI-RADS scale ranging from 1 to 5. The mean categorical scores of all diagnostic processes were around the level of borderline lesions: mammography: 3.49, ultrasonography: 3.06, cytology: 2.47 and physical examination: 1.67. The average age of the patients in the benign and malignant groups were the same: 58 years. The two groups did not differ significantly over either distribution of coded mammographical results (p = 0.2092), or the distribution of mammographical parenchyma density patterns (p = 0.4875). However, the malignant and benign groups differed significantly from each other over the distribution of coded ultrasonographic (p = 0.0176) and cytological (p < 0.0001) results. In conclusion, in the preoperative diagnosis of asymptomatic \"black-stars\", mammography detects the non-palpable lesions, and ultrasonography together with cytology proved better in the analysis, provided FNAB is US guided. Due to the complex diagnostic approach the nature of the \"black stars\" is known in the majority of cases prior to the surgical biopsy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aim of breast MRI is to obtain a reliable evaluation of any lesion within the breast. It is currently always used as an adjunct to the standard diagnostic procedures of the breast, i.e., clinical examination, mammography and ultrasound. Whereas the sensitivity of breast MRI is usually very high, specificity—as in all breast imaging modalities—depends on many factors such as reader expertise, use of adequate techniques and composition of the patient cohorts. Since breast MRI will always yield MR-only visible questionable lesions that require an MR-guided intervention for clarification, MRI should only be offered by institutions that can also offer a MRI-guided breast biopsy or that are in close contact with a site that can perform this type of biopsy for them. Radiologists involved in breast imaging should ensure that they have a thorough knowledge of the MRI techniques that are necessary for breast imaging, that they know how to evaluate a breast MRI using the ACR BI-RADS MRI lexicon, and most important, when to perform breast MRI. This manuscript provides guidelines on the current best practice for the use of breast MRI, and the methods to be used, from the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI).",

        "Methods": "Forty-four patients with bloody or serosanguineous nipple discharge and negative mammographic findings (35/44 cases) underwent MRI for evaluation of breast ducts. Ultrasonography, negative in 18 patients, identified 26 cases of ductal ectasia (12 simple, nine with solid intraductal echoes and wall thickening, five with inhomogeneous parenchyma). Galactography was negative in three patients and positive in nine. Nineteen patients were followed up by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and cytological evaluation of nipple discharge (6-12 months); three patients underwent excisional biopsy, ten core biopsy and 12 cytological biopsy (followed by excisional biopsy).",
        "Results/Findings": "MRI identified 25 enhancing lesions Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 3 or 4) and confirmed the galactographic findings (ductal ectasia, intraluminal filling defects). Five papillomatoses appeared as patchy, homogeneous enhancing areas, 15 intraductal papillomas as areas with well-defined margins and type II time-intensity curves, and two atypical ductal hyperplasias as diffuse nodular enhancement. One micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), one papillary carcinoma and one infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) were visualised as two segmental areas of enhancement and one mass-like enhancement with poorly defined margins (BI-RADS 4). The follow-up was negative, showing no pathological enhancement (BI-RADS 1) in 12 patients and benign enhancement (BI-RADS 2) in seven.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Multiple genetic loci confer susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers. We have previously developed a model (BOADICEA) under which susceptibility to breast cancer is explained by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, as well as by the joint multiplicative effects of many genes (polygenic component). We have now updated BOADICEA using additional family data from two UK population-based studies of breast cancer and family data from BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers identified by 22 population-based studies of breast or ovarian cancer. The combined data set includes 2785 families (301 BRCA1 positive and 236 BRCA2 positive). Incidences were smoothed using locally weighted regression techniques to avoid large variations between adjacent intervals. A birth cohort effect on the cancer risks was implemented, whereby each individual was assumed to develop cancer according to calendar period-specific incidences. The fitted model predicts that the average breast cancer risks in carriers increase in more recent birth cohorts. For example, the average cumulative breast cancer risk to age 70 years among BRCA1 carriers is 50% for women born in 1920-1929 and 58% among women born after 1950. The model was further extended to take into account the risks of male breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer, and to allow for the risk of multiple cancers. BOADICEA can be used to predict carrier probabilities and cancer risks to individuals with any family history, and has been implemented in a user-friendly Web-based program (http://www.srl.cam.ac.uk/genepi/boadicea/boadicea_home.html).",

        "Methods": "MRIs of 48 patients with IBC were compared with an equivalent cohort of 52 subjects with LABC. Age and histopathologic subtype were equivalent between the two groups.

        "Results/Findings": "No significant differences of prevalences could be found for the following criteria: dynamic tumor signal characteristics, prominent vessels, perifocal edema, axillary lymph node involvement, morphology of focal masses, and morphologic pattern of non-mass like enhancement. Otherwise, the quantity of focal masses and the spatial distribution of the tumoral infiltration significantly differed between the two cancer groups. The following parameters occurred more frequently in the IBC cases: edema (cutaneous/subcutaneous 81.3%, perimamillar 70.8%, diffuse 89.6%, prepectoral 72.9%, intramuscular pectoral 41.7%), thickening (75.0%) and pathologic enhancement (60.4%) of Cooper's ligaments, skin thickening (83.3%), punched-out sign (initially strong, focal increase of some dermal or subcutaneous parts followed by slow-continuous enhancement of the surrounding skin; 56.3%).",

        "Background/Purpose": "During pregnancy and lactation, the breast can be affected by a variety of specific and unique disorders, including benign disorders closely related to physiologic changes, inflammatory and infectious diseases, juvenile papillomatosis, and benign and malignant tumors. Patients with pregnancy-associated breast carcinoma tend to have more advanced neoplasms at diagnosis and a poorer prognosis due to delayed diagnosis and a more aggressive biologic pattern. Pregnancy-related Burkitt lymphoma characteristically manifests with bilateral and diffuse involvement of the breasts. Fibroadenoma may manifest with growth, infarction, large cysts, prominent ducts, and secretory hyperplasia during pregnancy and lactation. Galactocele is the breast lesion most commonly found during lactation and manifests as either pseudolipoma, a cystic mass with a fat-fluid level, or pseudohamartoma. Tumors and diseases affecting the breasts during pregnancy and lactation are basically the same as those observed in nonpregnant women but may have a different appearance. The sensitivity of mammography in pregnant and lactating women is decreased due to increased parenchymal density. Instead, ultrasonography is the most appropriate radiologic method for evaluating breast masses in this setting and is particularly useful in the diagnosis and treatment of abscesses. Knowledge of the unique entities that are specifically related to pregnancy and lactation and of their radiologic-pathologic appearances can help the radiologist make the correct diagnosis.",

        "Methods": "Data from 1607 African American women with invasive breast cancer and 1647 African American control subjects in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study were used to compute relative and attributable risks that were based on age at menarche, number of affected mother or sisters, and number of previous benign biopsy examinations. Absolute risks were obtained by combining this information with data on invasive breast cancer incidence in African American women from the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program and with national mortality data. Eligibility screening data from the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial were used to determine how the new model would affect eligibility, and independent data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) were used to assess how well numbers of invasive breast cancers predicted by the new model agreed with observed cancers.",
        "Results/Findings": "Tables and graphs for estimating relative risks and projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk with confidence intervals were developed for African American women. Relative risks for family history and number of biopsies and attributable risks estimated from the CARE population were lower than those from the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, as was the discriminatory accuracy (i.e., concordance). Using eligibility screening data from the STAR trial, we estimated that 30.3% of African American women would have had 5-year invasive breast cancer risks of at least 1.66% by use of the CARE model, compared with only 14.5% by use of the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. The numbers of cancers predicted by the CARE model agreed well with observed numbers of cancers (i.e., it was well calibrated) in data from the WHI, except that it underestimated risk in African American women with breast biopsy examinations.",

Ultimately, 182/306 (59%) patients underwent surgery and/or biopsy. Overall incidence of malignant or high-risk pathology was 15% (46/306). DG was completed in 139/163 (85%) studies and detected 12 cancers and seven high-risk lesions (HRL), but failed to identify four cancers and 2 HRL (PPV 19%, NPV 63%). MRI detected seven cancers and three HRL, but failed to identify one cancer and one HRL (PPV 56%, NPV 87%). MDE alone (n = 35) detected five cancers and three HRL. Of all patients not having surgery, (142/306, 41%), one (0.01%) presented with an invasive cancer at 102 months (median follow-up, 6.3 months; range, 0-124 months).",

Ductography is a poor predictor of underlying pathology and cannot exclude malignancy. MRI's higher predictive values may allow for improved patient selection and treatment planning; however, MRI should not replace MDE as the gold standard to exclude malignancy in patients with ND and negative standard evaluation.",

What are her risks of developing breast cancer with or without such a mutation? These risks taken together with the risks and benefits of the intervention will then determine whether an intervention is appropriate. A number of models have been developed for assessing these risks with varying degrees of validation.

Sensitivity was 77.4% at FFDM and 61.5% at SFM (P=.07); specificity was 96.5% and 97.9%, respectively (P<.005). Interval cancer rate was 17.4 at FFDM and 23.6 at SFM. The proportion of cancers with discordant double readings was comparable at FFDM and SFM.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FFDM resulted in a significantly higher cancer detection rate than did SFM. The PPVs were comparable for the two imaging modalities.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as an additional screening test for young women at high risk of breast cancer in whom mammography alone has poor sensitivity. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of adding MRI to mammography with or without breast ultrasound and clinical breast examination (CBE) in screening this population. We found consistent evidence in 5 studies that adding MRI provides a highly sensitive screening strategy (sensitivity range: 93-100%) compared to mammography alone (25-59%) or mammography plus ultrasound+/-CBE (49-67%). Meta-analysis of the three studies that compared MRI plus mammography versus mammography alone showed the sensitivity of MRI plus mammography as 94% (95%CI 86-98%) and the incremental sensitivity of MRI as 58% (95%CI 47-70%). Incremental sensitivity of MRI was lower when added to mammography plus ultrasound (44%, 95%CI 27-61%) or to the combination of mammography, ultrasound plus CBE (31-33%). Estimates of screening specificity with MRI were less consistent but suggested a 3-5-fold higher risk of patient recall for investigation of false positive results. No studies assessed as to whether adding MRI reduces patient mortality, interval or advanced breast cancer rates, and we did not find strong evidence that MRI leads to the detection of earlier stage disease. Conclusions about the effectiveness of MRI therefore depend on assumptions about the benefits of early detection from trials of mammographic screening in older average risk populations. The extent to which high risk younger women receive the same benefits from early detection and treatment of MRI-detected cancers has not yet been established.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The potential biological effects of in utero radiation exposure of a developing fetus include prenatal death, intrauterine growth restriction, small head size, mental retardation, organ malformation, and childhood cancer. The risk of each effect depends on the gestational age at the time of exposure, fetal cellular repair mechanisms, and the absorbed radiation dose level. A comparison between the dose levels associated with each of these risks and the estimated fetal doses from typical radiologic examinations lends support to the conclusion that fetal risks are minimal and, therefore, that radiologic and nuclear medicine examinations that may provide significant diagnostic information should not be withheld from pregnant women. The latter position is advocated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, National Council on Radiation Protection, American College of Radiology, and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. However, although the risks are small, it is important to ensure that radiation doses are kept as low as reasonably achievable.",

For comparison, we also calculated the breast cancer rate following 215,283 normal screening mammograms. Hazard ratios (HR) are presented.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 480 subsequent breast cancer diagnoses among 14,602 women with benign breast biopsies and 4,402 breast cancer diagnoses among 215,283 women with mammograms assigned a \"negative\" or \"benign finding\" assessment. Histologic diagnoses in absence of atypia had an age-adjusted HR of 1.95 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.77-2.15]. Among low-risk histologic diagnoses, the strongest associations with subsequent breast cancer development included adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, calcifications, and ductal hyperplasia. Fibroadenoma, inflammation, and cysts did not exhibit an association with breast cancer development. Women with low-risk diagnoses and breast tissue characterized as fatty or with scattered densities had a HR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.68-2.60), whereas women with low-risk histologic diagnoses and dense breasts had a HR of 3.36 (95% CI, 2.83-3.99).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The observed breast cancer occurrence contributes to evidence of increased risk following benign biopsy.

Information on treatment and prognostic factors were obtained from source records. The study group was linked to the records of the Screening Mammography Program of BC to identify screening histories on women prior to diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between screening participation and treatment and to predict treatment use from prognostic factors. Fifteen hundred and eighty-nine women with breast cancer were included in the study and 1,071 (67%) had participated in screening prior to diagnosis: 786 (49%) had been screened within the 30 months prior to their diagnosis (regular participants). Breast conserving surgery (BCS) rates were higher (OR = 2.3, p < 0.001) and chemotherapy use lower (OR = 0.53, p < 0.001) among regular participants compared with nonparticipants after adjustment for age. A predictive model based on the distribution of prognostic factors between participants provided estimates of OR = 1.47 and OR = 0.54 for BCS and chemotherapy, respectively, and adjustment for self-selection changed the predicted values to OR = 1.16 and OR = 0.67, respectively.

        "Methods": "We retrospectively reviewed data from our high-risk screening program prospective database for the period from April 1999 (when screening MRI was first performed at our institution) to July 2005. Patients with AH or LCIS demonstrated on previous surgical biopsy were identified. All patients underwent yearly mammography and twice yearly clinical breast examination. Additional screening MRI was performed at the discretion of the physician and patient.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 378 patients; 126 had AH and 252 had LCIS. Of these, 182 (48%) underwent one or more screening MRIs (mean, 2.6 MRIs; range, 1-8) during this period, whereas 196 (52%) did not. Those who had MRIs were younger (P < 0.001) with stronger family histories of breast cancer (P = 0.02). In MRI-screened patients, 55 biopsies were recommended in 46/182 (25%) patients, with 46/55 (84%) biopsies based on MRI findings alone. Cancer was detected in 6/46 (13%) MRI-generated biopsies. None of the six cancers detected on MRI were seen on recent mammogram. All six cancers were detected in five patients (one with bilateral breast cancer) with LCIS; none were detected by MRI in the AH group. Thus, cancer was detected in 5/135 (4%) of patients with LCIS undergoing MRI. The yield of MRI screening overall was cancer detection in 6/46 (13%) biopsies, 5/182 (3%) MRI-screened patients and 5/478 (1%) total MRIs done. In two additional MRI-screened patients, cancer was detected by a palpable mass in one, and on prophylactic surgery in the other and missed by all recent imaging studies. For 196 non-MRI-screened patients, 21 (11%) underwent 22 biopsies during the same period. Eight of 22 (36%) biopsies yielded cancer in seven patients. All MRI-detected cancers were stage 0-I, whereas all non-MRI cancers were stage I-II.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with AH and LCIS selected to undergo MRI screening were younger with stronger family histories of breast cancer.

A meta-analysis of all previous trials showed a 15% mortality reduction in invited women aged 40-49 years at study entry, but this finding could be due in part to screening of women after age 50 years. The Age trial was designed to study the effect on mortality of inviting women for annual mammography from age 40 years.",
        "Methods": "160,921 women aged 39-41 years were randomly assigned in the ratio 1:2 to an intervention group of annual mammography to age 48 years or to a control group of usual medical care. The trial was undertaken in 23 NHS breast-screening units in England, Wales, and Scotland. The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle and compared mortality rates in the two groups at 10 years' follow-up. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN24647151.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a mean follow-up of 10.7 years there was a reduction in breast-cancer mortality in the intervention group, in relative and absolute terms, which did not reach statistical significance (relative risk 0.83 [95% CI 0.66-1.04], p=0.11; absolute risk reduction 0.40 per 1000 women invited to screening [95% CI -0.07 to 0.87]). Mortality reduction adjusted for non-compliance in women actually screened was estimated as 24% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.01).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although the reduction in breast-cancer mortality observed in this trial is not significant, it is consistent with results of other trials of mammography alone in this age-group. Future decisions on screening policy should be informed by further follow-up from this trial and should take account of possible costs and harms as well as benefits.",

Malignancy was detected on excisional biopsy in 31% of patients with ADH, 16% of patients with ALH, and 25% of patients with LCIS. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, parity, hormonal status, or previous benign breast biopsies. The presence of a mass on mammography was associated with an increased upgrade rate to malignancy, while biopsies performed using vacuum-assisted devices, larger gauge biopsy needles, and greater number of cores were associated with a lower upgrade rate.",

In all investigated subgroups the discriminating capacity (measured by the area under the ROC-curve) was higher for MRI than for mammography, with the largest differences for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (0.237), for women between 40 and 49 years (0.227) and for women with a low breast density (0.237).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This report supports the earlier recommendation that MRI should be a standard screening method for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Within the Dutch MRI Screening (MRISC) study, a Dutch multicenter screening study for hereditary breast cancer, the authors investigated whether previously reported increased diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with mammography would be maintained during subsequent screening rounds.",
        "Methods": "From November 1999 to October 2003, 1909 eligible women were included in the study. Screening parameters and tumor characteristics of different rounds were calculated and compared. The authors defined 3 different types of imaging screening rounds: first round in women never screened by imaging before, first round in women screened by imaging (mainly mammography) before, and subsequent rounds.",
        "Results/Findings": "The difference in sensitivity for invasive cancers between mammography and MRI was largest in the first round of women previously screened with mammography (20.0 vs. 93.3%; P=.003), but also in subsequent rounds, there was a significant difference in favor of MRI (29.4 vs. 76.5%; P=.02). The difference in false-positive rate between mammography and MRI was also largest in the first round of women previously screened with mammography (5.5 vs. 14.0%; P<.001), and it remained significant in subsequent rounds (4.6 vs. 8.2%; P<.001). Screen-detected tumors were smaller and more often lymph node negative than symptomatic tumors in age-matched control patients, but no major differences in tumor stage were found between tumors detected at subsequent rounds compared with those in the first round.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In subsequent rounds, a significantly higher sensitivity and better discriminating capacity of MRI compared with mammography was maintained, and a favorable tumor stage compared with age-matched symptomatic controls. As results of these subsequent screening rounds were most predictive for long-term effects, the authors expect that this screening program will contribute to a decrease of breast cancer mortality in these high-risk women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Nipple discharge is the third most common breast complaint after breast pain and breast mass. It is most often a benign process. Up to 50% women in their reproductive years can express one or more drops of fluid from the breast. Nipple discharge can be of several types, including milky, multicolored and sticky, purulent, clear and watery, yellow or serous, pink or serosanguinous, bloody or sanguinous. The characteristics of the nipple discharge help in the early diagnosis and management of breast disease. The most common cause of pathologic nipple discharge is a benign papilloma followed by ductal ectasia, and the least likely is carcinoma. Most nipple discharges are the result of a clinically insignificant benign process; therefore, less invasive, nonsurgical diagnostic modalities have been explored to reduce the need for surgical intervention. The evaluation and diagnosis of nipple discharge is important for the early detection of carcinoma, when present; and, in the case of benign disease, it is necessary to stop the incommodious discharge.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In an earlier publication, our evaluation of data from breast cancer screening programs in seven Swedish counties suggested a 40% reduction in incidence-based breast cancer mortality among women actually screened. In the current study, we expand the previous analysis from seven counties to 13 large areas within nine counties, including six of the original counties and seven additional areas, examine a longer period of follow-up (20-44 years), apply new analytic methods for the evaluation of incidence-based breast cancer mortality, and estimate the number needed to screen to save one life.",
        "Methods": "Data from six of the original counties (one being excluded as it does not yet have 10 years of follow-up after the initiation of screening), with increased follow-up, and seven additional large areas, within three counties, representing approximately 45% of Swedish women, provide information about age at diagnosis, age at death, and screening history for 542,187 women in the prescreening and 566,423 women in the screening epochs. Regardless of year of diagnosis, there were a total of 6,231 deaths due to breast cancer in the period of study as a whole. Of these, 4,778 were incidence-based deaths in the two epochs, i.e., death among cases diagnosed within either the prescreening or screening period. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression and adjusted, when necessary, for self-selection bias, contemporaneous changes in incidence, and changes in mortality independent of screening.",
        "Results/Findings": "Attendance was uniformly high, averaging 75% in the screening epochs. Recall rates for assessment varied from 4% to 5% at the first round of screening and approximately 3% at later rounds. Detection rates averaged five breast cancers per 1,000 women screened in the first round, and four breast cancers per 1,000 women screened in subsequent rounds. There was a significant 45% reduction in incidence-based breast cancer mortality among screened women in the screening epoch relative to incidence-based breast cancer mortality in the prescreening epoch (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence intervals, 0.51-0.59). After adjusting for self-selection bias, there still was a significant 43% reduction in incidence-based breast cancer mortality associated with screening (relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence intervals, 0.53-0.62).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These results indicate a reduction in breast cancer mortality of between 40% and 45% in association with screening, after adjustment for self-selection bias. These results were obtained with modest human costs: the number needed to screen to save one life was estimated as 472.",

        "Methods": "We conducted a surveillance cohort study of 529 asymptomatic women who, based on their family history and/or mutational analysis, were suspected or proven to carry a breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA). A total of 1,542 annual surveillance rounds were completed with a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. Diagnostic accuracies of the three imaging modalities used alone or in different combinations were compared.",
        "Results/Findings": "Forty-three breast cancers were identified in the total cohort (34 invasive, nine ductal carcinoma-in-situ). Overall sensitivity of diagnostic imaging was 93% (40 of 43 breast cancers); overall node-positive rate was 16%, and one interval cancer occurred (one of 43 cancers, or 2%). In the analysis by modality, sensitivity was low for mammography (33%) and ultrasound (40%) or the combination of both (49%). MRI offered a significantly higher sensitivity (91%). The sensitivity of mammography in the higher risk groups was 25%, compared with 100% for MRI. Specificity of MRI (97.2%) was equivalent to that of mammography (96.8%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Mammography alone, and also mammography combined with breast ultrasound, seems insufficient for early diagnosis of breast cancer in women who are at increased familial risk with or without documented BRCA mutation. If MRI is used for surveillance, diagnosis of intraductal and invasive familial or hereditary cancer is achieved with a significantly higher sensitivity and at a more favorable stage.",

We estimated this future risk, taking into account age and calendar year of HL diagnosis, HL treatment information, population breast cancer incidence rates, and competing causes of death.",
        "Methods": "Relative risks of breast cancer for categories defined by radiation dose to the chest (0, 20- < 40 Gy, or > or = 40 Gy) and use of alkylating agents (yes or no) were estimated from a case-control study conducted within an international population-based cohort of 3817 female 1-year survivors of HL diagnosed at age 30 years or younger from January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1994. To compute cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer, we used modified standardized incidence ratios to relate cohort breast cancer risks to those in the general population, enabling application of population-based breast cancer rates, and we allowed for competing risks by using population-based mortality rates in female HL survivors.",
        "Results/Findings": "Cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer increased with age at end of follow-up, time since HL diagnosis, and radiation dose. For an HL survivor who was treated at age 25 years with a chest radiation dose of at least 40 Gy without alkylating agents, estimated cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer by age 35, 45, and 55 years were 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9% to 2.1%), 11.1% (95% CI = 7.4% to 16.3%), and 29.0% (95% CI = 20.2% to 40.1%), respectively. Cumulative absolute risks were lower in women treated with alkylating agents.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer projections varied considerably by type of HL therapy, time since HL diagnosis, and age at end of follow-up. These estimates are applicable to HL survivors treated with regimens of the past and can be used to counsel such patients and plan management and preventive strategies. Projections should be used with caution, however, in patients treated with more recent approaches, including limited-field radiotherapy and/or ovary-sparing chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Most types of invasive breast cancer are thought to evolve over long periods from specific preexisting benign lesions. Of the many types of benign entities found in the human breast, only a few have clinically significant premalignant potential. Currently, the best-characterized premalignant lesions are atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, and lobular carcinoma in situ. Ductal carcinoma in situ is considered to be a preinvasive malignant lesion. Two additional lesions, unfolded lobules and usual ductal hyperplasia, are sometimes considered to be very early premalignant epithelial abnormalities. Premalignant lesions are currently defined by their histologic features, and not all necessarily progress to invasive cancer. This suggests that although lesions within specific categories look alike, they must possess underlying genetic differences that cause some to remain stable and others to advance. The development of modern molecular genetic techniques has allowed breast cancer researchers to clarify the multistep model of breast carcinogenesis. Recent studies indicate that cancer evolves by highly diverse genetic mechanisms, and research into these altered pathways may identify specific early defects that might be targeted to prevent progression of premalignant lesions to invasive cancer. Current clinical management is heterogeneous and depends on histologic examination and individual patient factors. Options for breast cancer risk reduction and prevention are available.",

Sensitivity was significantly higher for CE MRI (77%, 95% CI 60-90) than for mammography (40%, 24-58; p=0.01), and was 94% (81-99) when both methods were used. Specificity was 93% (92-95) for mammography, 81% (80-83) for CE MRI (p<0.0001), and 77% (75-79) with both methods. The difference between CE MRI and mammography sensitivities was particularly pronounced in BRCA1 carriers (13 cancers; 92%vs 23%, p=0.004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our findings indicate that CE MRI is more sensitive than mammography for cancer detection. Specificity for both procedures was acceptable.

        "Background/Purpose": "Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) diagnosed in core needle biopsy (CNB) are generally regarded as risk indicators for developing invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma in either breast. Currently, there are no well-established guidelines for management of these patients. The most common management options are careful observation and endocrine chemoprophylaxis for high-risk patients. Previous studies had contradicting recommendations regarding follow-up surgical excision (FSE) of CNB yielding ALH or LCIS. These studies, unfortunately, have been limited by their retrospective nature, small number of patients examined, and association with other high-risk lesions. Only CNB diagnosed as pure LCIS or ALH (not associated with other high-risk lesions such as ADH, radial scar, or papilloma) were included in the study. We reviewed 33 CNB (20 ALH and 13 LCIS) with subsequent FSE from 33 patients (age range, 30-83 years; mean, 58 years). Eighteen of these patients were prospectively analyzed, where FSE was performed in an unselected fashion. All CNBs were obtained by mammotome (11-gauge, 30 cases; and 14-gauge, 3 cases). Mammography identified calcifications in 29 cases (88%) and a mass in 4 cases (12%). FSE revealed infiltrating ductal and/or lobular carcinoma in 4 of 13 LCIS (31%). FSE of 20 ALH revealed cancer in 5 cases (25%), including 4 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 1 invasive lobular carcinoma. Seven of these nine cancers were associated with calcifications, and two presented as masses. Sampling error and underestimation of cancer (DCIS or invasive carcinoma) was associated with CNB diagnosis of LCIS or ALH in 27% of all cases. Underestimation of cancer was seen in 28% of prospectively examined patients, including 20% of ALH and 38% of LCIS. CNB associated with mass lesions or that showed histologic features of pleomorphic LCIS or extensive classic LCIS had a higher rate of cancer underestimation. Despite removal of all abnormal mammographic calcifications by CNB in 6 patients, one cancer was detected on FSE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study reported to date, and the only one to include prospectively examined patients with no pre-selection bias. Our data strongly suggests that subsequent FSE is warranted in all patients with CNB diagnoses of LCIS or ALH, to exclude the presence of cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Many factors determine a woman's risk of breast cancer. Some of them are genetic and relate to family history, others are based on personal factors such as reproductive history and medical history. While many papers have concentrated on subsets of these risk factors, no papers have incorporated personal risk factors with a detailed genetic analysis. There is a need to combine these factors to provide a better overall determinant of risk. The discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has explained some of the genetic determinants of breast cancer risk, but these genes alone do not explain all of the familial aggregation of breast cancer. We have developed a model incorporating the BRCA genes, a low penetrance gene and personal risk factors. For an individual woman her family history is used in conjuction with Bayes theorem to iteratively produce the likelihood of her carrying any genes predisposing to breast cancer, which in turn affects her likelihood of developing breast cancer. This risk was further refined based on the woman's personal history. The model has been incorporated into a computer program that gives a personalised risk estimate.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Pain is one of the most common breast symptoms experienced by women. It can be severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities, but the etiology and optimal treatment remain undefined. Breast pain is typically approached according to its classification as cyclic mastalgia, noncyclic mastalgia, and extramammary (nonbreast) pain. Cyclic mastalgia is breast pain that has a clear relationship to the menstrual cycle. Noncyclic mastalgia may be constant or intermittent but is not associated with the menstrual cycle and often occurs after menopause. Extramammary pain arises from the chest wall or other sources and is interpreted as having a cause within the breast. The risk of cancer in a woman presenting with breast pain as her only symptom is extremely low. After appropriate clinical evaluation, most patients with breast pain respond favorably to a combination of reassurance and nonpharmacological measures. The medications danazol, tamoxifen, and bromocriptine are effective; however, the potentially serious adverse effects of these medications limit their use to selected patients with severe, sustained breast pain. The status of other therapeutic strategies and directions for future research are discussed.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To find out whether ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and ultrasound and stereotactic-guided large core needle biopsy (LCNB) are reliable alternatives to needle-localised open breast biopsy (NLBB) in daily practice, we performed a retrospective study and evaluated the validity of these methods. In all, 718 women with 749 nonpalpable breast lesions from three Dutch Hospitals were included, and the validity of the various methods for diagnosis was assessed. This was carried out according to a method described by Burbank and Parker for evaluating the quality of an image-guided breast intervention. We compared our results with the outcome of the COBRA study. Overall, all diagnostic strategies (NLBB, FNA, LCNB ultrasound and stereotactic guided) show comparable agreement rates. However, the miss rates differ: 2% for NLBB, 3% for COBRA (LCNB in study setting), 5% for FNA and 8-12% for LCNB in practice. Fine-needle aspiration was nonconclusive in 29%, and shows an overestimation for DCIS in 9%. The DCIS underestimate rate in NLBB was 8%. For the assessment of lesions consisting of microcalcifications only and to exclude malignancy in all other lesions, a 14-gauge needle should be used. Ultrasound-guided intervention can be performed in a large percentage of nonpalpable lesions. Lesions consisting only of microcalcifications on mammography need special attention.",

        "Methods": "In the current study, VABs were performed successfully for 2874 patients at 5 sites. Benign lesions were verified by follow-up. Surgery was recommended for malignant and borderline lesions. VAB was performed on patients with lesions rated as highly suspicious (6%), intermediate to suspicious (85%), or probably benign (9%). Fifty-eight percent of the lesions were < 10 mm and 70% had microcalcifications.",
        "Results/Findings": "The authors identified 7% of patients with invasive carcinomas, 15% with ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), 5% with atypical ductal hyperplasias (ADH), and 0.6% with lobular carcinomas in situ. The results of the VAB necessitated an upgrade of 24% of patients with ADH to DCIS or DCIS and invasive carcinoma. Twelve percent of patients with DCIS proved to have invasive carcinoma. Seventy-three percent of the patients had benign lesions. Only 1 false-negative result was encountered (negative predictive value, 99.95%). Minor side effects were reported to occur in 1.4% of patients and 0.1% of patients required a subsequent intervention. Scarring relevant for mammography was rare among patients (i.e., 0.3% of patients had relevant scarring).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Quality-assured VAB was found to be highly reliable. VAB effectively identified patients with benign lesions and assisted therapeutic decisions. Most important, only a single case of malignancy was missed. A close interdisciplinary approach assured optimal results.",

We describe the pattern and incidence of subsequent neoplasms (SNs) occurring with extended follow-up.",
        "Methods": "Median age at diagnosis of HD was 11.7 years (range, 0.3 to 16.9 years) and at last follow-up was 27.8 years. Median length of follow-up was 17.0 years.",
        "Results/Findings": "An additional 103 SNs were ascertained (total SNs = 212). The cohort was at an 18.5-fold increased risk of developing SNs compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 18.5, 95% CI, 15.6 to 21.7). The cumulative incidence of any second malignancy was 10.6% at 20 years, increasing to 26.3% at 30 years; and of solid malignancies was 7.3% at 20 years, increasing to 23.5% at 30 years. Breast cancer was the most common solid malignancy (SIR, 56.7). Other commonly occurring solid malignancies included thyroid cancer (SIR, 36.4), bone tumors (SIR, 37.1), and colorectal (SIR, 36.4), lung (SIR, 27.3), and gastric cancers (SIR, 63.9). Risk factors for solid tumors included young age at HD and radiation-based therapy. Thirty-two patients developed third neoplasms, with the cumulative incidence approaching 21% at 10 years from diagnosis of second malignancy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Additional follow-up of this large cohort of HD survivors documents an increasing occurrence of known radiation-associated solid tumors, (breast and thyroid cancers), as well as emergence of epithelial neoplasms common in adults, (colon and lung cancers) at a younger age than expected in the general population, necessitating ongoing surveillance of this high risk population.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Accurate individualised breast cancer risk assessment is essential to provide risk-benefit analysis prior to initiating interventions designed to lower breast cancer risk. Several mathematical models for the estimation of individual breast cancer risk have been proposed. However, no single model integrates family history, hormonal factors, and benign breast disease in a comprehensive fashion. A new model by Tyrer and Cuzick has addressed these deficiencies. Therefore, this study has assessed the goodness of fit and discriminatory value of the Tyrer-Cuzick model against established models namely Gail, Claus, and Ford.",
        "Methods": "The goodness of fit and discriminatory accuracy of the models was assessed using data from 1933 women attending the Family History Evaluation and Screening Programme, of whom 52 developed cancer. All models were applied to these women over a mean follow up of 5.27 years to estimate risk of breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "The ratios (95% confidence intervals) of expected to observed numbers of breast cancers were 0.48 (0.37 to 0.64) for Gail, 0.56 (0.43 to 0.75) for Claus, 0.49 (0.37 to 0.65) for Ford, and 0.81 (0.62 to 1.08) for Tyrer-Cuzick. The accuracy of the models for individual cases was evaluated using ROC curves. These showed that the area under the curve was 0.735 for Gail, 0.716 for Claus, 0.737 for Ford, and 0.762 for Tyrer-Cuzick.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The Tyrer-Cuzick model is the most consistently accurate model for prediction of breast cancer.

        "Methods": "We investigated the effects of radiation dose, chemotherapy (CT), and reproductive factors on breast cancer risk in a nested case-control study in The Netherlands in a cohort of 770 female patients who had been diagnosed with HD before age 41. Detailed treatment information and data on reproductive factors were collected for 48 case patients who developed breast cancer 5 or more years after diagnosis of HD and 175 matched control subjects. The radiation dose was estimated to the area of the breast where the case patient's tumor had developed and to a comparable location in matched control subjects. Relative risks (RRs) of breast cancer were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "The risk of breast cancer increased statistically significantly with radiation dose (P(trend) =.01); patients who received 38.5 Gy or more had an RR of 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3 to 16) times that of patients who received less than 4 Gy. Patients who received both CT and radiotherapy (RT) had a statistically significantly lower risk than those treated with RT alone (RR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.91). Breast cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose among patients who received RT only (RR = 12.7, 95% CI = 1.8 to 86, for patients receiving > or =38.5 Gy) but not among patients treated with CT and RT. Sixty-nine percent of control subjects treated with RT and more than six cycles of CT, but only 9% of those who received RT alone, reached menopause before age 41. Reaching menopause before age 36 was associated with a strongly reduced risk of breast cancer (RR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.45).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer risk increases with increasing radiation dose up to at least 40 Gy. The substantial risk reduction associated with CT may reflect its effect on menopausal age, suggesting that ovarian hormones promote tumorigenesis after radiation has produced an initiating event.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 3835 breasts were examined in 2020 patients, with a 6.3% prevalence of breast cancer. Breast US detected 8 extra malignancies and correctly downgraded 332 cases from a positive to a negative diagnosis (ie, from a suggested malignancy to no malignancy). Receiver-operating characteristic curves showed a significant improvement in diagnostic value by adding US to MAM and a CE (area under the curve for CE + MAM + US vs CE + MAM, 0.99 vs 0.95; P =.002). The diagnostic yield improved significantly in patients referred for palpable breast lumps (P =.004) or referred from the National Breast Cancer Screening Program (P =.05). Less pronounced was the value in patients referred for other symptoms or for follow-up of a prior breast malignancy. When breast imaging of the contralateral breast or of asymptomatic patients referred for reassurance or follow-up of a prior benign lesion was performed, the value of additional US remained undefined because of the few malignancies found.",

Few larger series are published on pregnancy-associated breast cancer. In a population-based study, we evaluated the outcome and prognostic factors in 173 breast-cancer patients. One hundred and twenty-two patients had pregnancy-associated breast cancer (20 coincident with pregnancy and 102 during lactation) and 51 patients had pregnancy subsequent to breast cancer. The median follow-up time was 151 months. Histopathological parameters and immunoreactivity for oestrogen and progesterone receptors c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-4 were studied. All three groups had tumours with high histological grade, low frequency of hormone receptors and high expression of c-erbB-2. The pregnancy and lactation groups were near identical with regard to all histopathological parameters and outcome. In the two pregnancy-associated breast-cancer groups, tumours were significantly larger, with more extensive lymph-node involvement. For node-negative tumours the respective 5- and 10-year survival rates were 62% and 50% in the pregnancy group and 60% and 50% in the lactation group. For node-positive tumours, respective 5- and 10-year survival rates were 50% and 34% in the pregnancy group and 50% and 33% in the lactation group.

        "Methods": "From a database of 2,072 image-guided procedures performed from July 1995 through September 2001, 150 cystic lesions were identified. Diagnosis was established with fine-needle aspiration (n = 55), 14-gauge core-needle biopsy (n = 81), or both (n = 14). Excision was performed for all malignant (n = 18) and atypical (n = 2) lesions and for 11 benign lesions, which recurred or enlarged at follow-up. Imaging follow-up was available for 92 of 119 benign lesions. Targeted sonography was performed with high-frequency (10-MHz center frequency) transducers. Imaging and histopathologic, cytologic, and/or microbiologic findings were reviewed. Lesions were categorized as simple cysts, complicated cysts (imperceptible wall, acoustic enhancement, low-level echoes), clustered microcysts, cystic masses with a thick (perceptible) wall and/or thick (> or =0.5 mm) septations, intracystic or mixed cystic and solid masses (at least 50% cystic), or predominantly solid masses with eccentric cystic foci.",

Of 38 lesions characterized as complicated cysts and one cyst with thin septations, none proved malignant, nor did any of 16 lesions characterized as clustered microcysts. Of 23 masses with thick indistinct walls or thick septations, seven proved malignant. Of 18 intracystic or mixed cystic and solid masses, four proved malignant. Of 38 predominantly solid masses with eccentric cystic foci, seven proved malignant.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Symptomatic complicated cysts generally warrant aspiration. All clustered microcysts were benign, but further study is required.

Of these 50 women, the breast with invasive cancer was the same breast diagnosed with atypical lobular hyperplasia (ipsilateral) in 34 (68%) and the contralateral breast in 12 (24%). The ratio of ipsilateral/ contralateral cancers for atypical lobular hyperplasia without other atypical lesions was 17/5. For six women with atypical lobular hyperplasia plus atypical ductal hyperplasia, the ratio was 1/1.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Image-guided percutaneous biopsy has largely replaced excisional biopsy of mammographic lesions. Vacuum-assisted core biopsy has improved sampling of such lesions. The objectives of this study were to define the accuracy of the vacuum-assisted 11-gauge stereotactic core biopsy in sampling of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and to define histologic and mammographic features of target lesions, which predict sampling errors.",
        "Methods": "Between October 1996 and March 2000, 1341 patients underwent stereotactic 11-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy. Patients with ADH or DCIS were encouraged to undergo excisional biopsy.",
        "Results/Findings": "Surgical excision of 37 ADH lesions revealed 5 missed DCIS lesions and 1 missed invasive cancer. Twelve of 91 DCIS lesions were upstaged to invasive cancer upon excision. The underestimation rate was highest in patients with DCIS when the target lesion for biopsy was a zone of calcifications >1.5 cm. No correlation existed between the histologic features of DCIS lesions diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy and the presence of infiltrating disease on excision.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Vacuum-assisted 11-gauge stereotactic core biopsy understages 13.2% and 13.5% of DCIS and ADH lesions, respectively. In patients with DCIS found by stereotactic biopsy, a target zone of calcifications >1.5 cm is associated with a higher underestimation rate of infiltrating disease.",

Patients who did not undergo biopsy had imaging and clinical follow-up; the mean follow-up period was 28.9 months (range, 24-33 months).",
        "Results/Findings": "Twelve patients underwent biopsy; benign histologic diagnoses were reported in all 12 (12 [6.9%] of 172).

The negative predictive value of combined negative mammographic and sonographic findings in a patient with a palpable abnormality of the breast was 100%.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Among women who practice breast self-examination (BSE), breast cancers may be detected when they are at an earlier stage and are smaller than in women who do not practice BSE. However, the efficacy of breast self-examination for decreasing breast cancer mortality is unproven. This study was conducted to determine whether an intensive program of BSE instruction will reduce the number of women dying of breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "From October 1989 through October 1991, 266,064 women associated with 519 factories in Shanghai were randomly assigned to a BSE instruction group (132,979 women) or a control group (133,085 women). Initial instruction in BSE was followed by reinforcement sessions 1 and 3 years later, by BSE practice under medical supervision at least every 6 months for 5 years, and by ongoing reminders to practice BSE monthly. The women were followed through December 2000 for mortality from breast cancer. Cumulative risk ratios of dying from breast cancer were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 135 (0.10%) breast cancer deaths in the instruction group and 131 (0.10%) in the control group. The cumulative breast cancer mortality rates through 10 to 11 years of follow-up were similar (cumulative risk ratio for women in the instruction group relative to that in the control group = 1.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.82 to 1.33; P =.72). However, more benign breast lesions were diagnosed in the instruction group than in the control group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Intensive instruction in BSE did not reduce mortality from breast cancer. Programs to encourage BSE in the absence of mammography would be unlikely to reduce mortality from breast cancer. Women who choose to practice BSE should be informed that its efficacy is unproven and that it may increase their chances of having a benign breast biopsy.",

They also analyzed the breast parenchymal density among all patients who had more than 2 years of follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 829 women, 374 had follow-up information. Two-hundred thirty-three patients had negative imaging findings with more than 2 years of follow-up. The other 141 women were presumed to be cancer free, as they were not identified by the State Cancer Registry. Six (2.6%) of the 233 women had a diagnosis of breast cancer in the area of the palpable abnormality. The six cancers were diagnosed among the 156 women who had radiographically dense breast tissue (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3 or 4). Among the 77 women with predominantly fatty tissues, no cancers were diagnosed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A negative mammographic and US finding of a palpable abnormality does not exclude breast cancer, but the likelihood of breast cancer is low, approximately 2.6%-2.7%. It may be higher if the breast tissues are dense and lower if they are predominantly fatty.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Stereotactic large-core needle biopsy is increasingly applied for the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast disease. Our study examines whether this minimally invasive technique is sufficiently accurate to replace surgical breast biopsy. In a prospective multicenter study, 973 consecutive women with 1,029 nonpalpable breast lesions were offered stereotactic 14-gauge needle biopsy. If the needle biopsy yielded breast cancer, the patient was offered therapeutic surgery. Surgical biopsy was proposed in cases of needle biopsies without malignancy. An expert panel reviewed all discrepancies in histologic diagnosis between the needle biopsy and open biopsy. Forty-five patients withdrew from participation and 113 (11%) planned needle biopsy procedures were cancelled. Of the 871 successful biopsy procedures, 95% were confirmed surgically. In 13 cases (1.5%), insufficient material was obtained for histologic assessment. Fifty-five percent of the needle biopsies were diagnosed as malignant (290 invasive cancers, 190 ductal carcinoma in situ). Thirteen of the 322 lesions (4%, 95% CI 2-7%) with a benign needle biopsy diagnosis contained malignancy after surgery. Six of the 26 (23%, 95% CI 9-44%) lesions with a high-risk diagnosis (atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ) were diagnosed as malignant after surgery. Five of the 30 lesions containing normal breast tissue held malignancy (17%, 95% CI 6-35%). Guidelines for the management of different categories of needle biopsy diagnoses were made. Application of these guidelines to the present findings resulted in sensitivity and specificity rates of 97% (95% CI 95-98%) and 99% (95% CI 97-100%), respectively. Stereotactic large-core needle biopsy is an accurate diagnostic instrument for nonpalpable breast disease. It may safely replace needle localised open-breast biopsy provided that high-risk and normal breast tissue diagnoses are followed by needle or open-breast biopsy.",

        "Methods": "One hundred twenty-three consecutive cases of breast thickening (103 patients) during a 1-year period were reviewed. Experienced breast examiners prospectively identified patients with breast thickening. Results of diagnostic mammographic work-up, breast US, breast biopsy, and clinical follow-up were retrospectively reviewed.",

Mammographic sensitivity for invasive cancer detection was 60% (three of five cases), specificity was 94% (102 of 108 cases), and negative predictive value was 97% (102 of 105 cases). Sensitivity of US alone was 100% (two of two cases), specificity was 96% (65 of 68 cases), and negative predictive value was 100% (65 of 65 cases). The combined negative predictive value of mammography and US was 100%. Patients with prior biopsies at the site of palpable thickening accounted for most false-negative mammograms.

        "Background/Purpose": "Paget's disease of the breast is a rare disorder of the nipple-areola complex often associated with an underlying in situ or invasive carcinoma. Eczematoid changes of the nipple-areola complex and persistent soreness or itching should raise suspicion of this disease. The histogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast continues to be debated and is important when considering treatment options. The epidermotropic theory suggests that Paget's cells are ductal carcinoma cells that have migrated from an underlying carcinoma of the breast parenchyma to the epidermis of the nipple. The in situ transformation theory has been proposed to explain the development of this disorder in patients in whom an underlying mammary carcinoma is not found or when there is an underlying carcinoma anatomically remote from the nipple-areola complex. Paget's cells are believed to arise as malignant cells in the epidermis of the nipple independent from any other pathologic process within the breast parenchyma. The current standard treatment of biopsy-proven Paget's disease involves mastectomy, although some studies have proposed the use of breast conservation therapy for patients in whom an underlying breast cancer cannot be located. We propose a treatment algorithm for patients presenting with Paget's disease of the breast.",

Suggestive findings were compared with tissue diagnoses from US-guided core biopsy specimens. US was initially performed by a US or a mammography technologist. The average time to perform the examination was approximately 10 minutes. Abnormal findings were corroborated by a fellowship-trained breast-imaging radiologist.",

Core needle path through each mass was documented in two orthogonal sections. A mean of 3.4 tissue core samples (range, 1-7) were obtained in each patient.",
        "Results/Findings": "Core needle biopsy resulted in the diagnosis of 66 malignancies, two cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and 30 benign diseases of the breast. Surgery with curative intent was performed in 63 breast malignancies and excisional biopsies were performed for 10 benign diseases (two cases of ADH and eight benign lesions). Twenty-five breast masses were managed nonoperatively: chemotherapy was performed in three locally advanced breast cancers and 3-year follow-up was conducted for 22 benign lesions. Malignancies were correctly diagnosed in all cases. No malignancy was discovered at surgery or during clinical follow-up of ADH and no benign breast lesions were diagnosed by core needle biopsy.

For patients diagnosed with breast cancer, images and medical records were reviewed to determine whether the palpable lesion evaluated on sonography and mammography corresponded to the patient's breast cancer. On the basis of the number of breast cancers that correlated to the palpable areas imaged, the negative predictive value of sonography with mammography was determined.",
        "Results/Findings": "Sixty-two of the 420 patients in the study group were already diagnosed with breast carcinoma, and eight new carcinomas were diagnosed during the study period. Only one of six ipsilateral cancers corresponded to a palpable lesion that had a negative imaging evaluation. This lesion was diagnosed as an invasive lobular cancer, hard and fixed at physical examination. Imaging and clinical follow-up of the remaining patients showed no abnormality at the sites of previously investigated palpable abnormalities. The mean imaging follow-up was 25 months. The negative predictive value of sonography and mammography in the setting of a palpable lesion was 99.8%.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Considerable uncertainty exists about the use of cancer screening tests in older people, as illustrated by the different age cutoffs recommended by various guideline panels. We suggest that a framework to guide individualized cancer screening decisions in older patients may be more useful to the practicing clinician than age guidelines. Like many medical decisions, cancer screening decisions require weighing quantitative information, such as risk of cancer death and likelihood of beneficial and adverse screening outcomes, as well as qualitative factors, such as individual patients' values and preferences. Our framework first anchors decisions through quantitative estimates of life expectancy, risk of cancer death, and screening outcomes based on published data. Potential benefits of screening are presented as the number needed to screen to prevent 1 cancer-specific death, based on the estimated life expectancy during which a patient will be screened. Estimates reveal substantial variability in the likelihood of benefit for patients of similar ages with varying life expectancies. In fact, patients with life expectancies of less than 5 years are unlikely to derive any survival benefit from cancer screening. We also consider the likelihood of potential harm from screening according to patient factors and test characteristics. Some of the greatest harms of screening occur by detecting cancers that would never have become clinically significant. This becomes more likely as life expectancy decreases. Finally, since many cancer screening decisions in older adults cannot be answered solely by quantitative estimates of benefits and harms, considering the estimated outcomes according to the patient's own values and preferences is the final step for making informed screening decisions.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Women and their clinicians are increasingly encouraged to use risk estimates derived from statistical models, primarily that of Gail et al., to aid decision making regarding potential prevention options for breast cancer, including chemoprevention with tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "We evaluated both the goodness of fit of the Gail et al. model 2 that predicts the risk of developing invasive breast cancer specifically and its discriminatory accuracy at the individual level in the Nurses' Health Study. We began with a cohort of 82 109 white women aged 45-71 years in 1992 and applied the model of Gail et al. to these women over a 5-year follow-up period to estimate a 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "The model fit well in the total sample (ratio of expected [E] to observed [O] numbers of cases = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 0.99). Underprediction was slightly greater for younger women (<60 years), but in most age and risk factor strata, E/O ratios were close to 1.0. The model fit equally well (E/O ratio = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.99) in a subset of women reporting recent screening (i.e., within 1 year before the baseline); among women with an estimated 5-year risk of developing invasive breast cancer of 1.67% or greater, the E/O ratio was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.96 to 1.12). The concordance statistic, which indicates discriminatory accuracy, for the Gail et al. model 2 when used to estimate 5-year risk was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.56 to 0.60). Only 3.3% of the 1354 cases of breast cancer observed in the cohort arose among women who fell into age-risk strata expected to have statistically significant net health benefits from prophylactic tamoxifen use.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The Gail et al. model 2 fit well in this sample in terms of predicting numbers of breast cancer cases in specific risk factor strata but had modest discriminatory accuracy at the individual level. This finding has implications for use of the model in clinical counseling of individual women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Screening for breast cancer with mammography in women aged 50 years or more has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer. However, the extent to which mammography contributes to the reduction of mortality in women who also undergo physical examination of the breasts is not known. This study was designed to compare breast cancer mortality following annual screening consisting of two-view mammography and physical examination of the breasts with mortality following annual screening by physical examination only. Breast self-examination was taught to all participants.",
        "Methods": "This trial randomly and individually assigned 39 405 women aged 50-59 years, recruited from January 1980 through March 1985, to one of the study arms. The women were followed by record linkage with the Canadian National Cancer Registry and National Mortality Database to December 31, 1993, and by active follow-up of breast cancer patients to June 30, 1996.",
        "Results/Findings": "Randomization achieved virtually equal distribution of demographic and breast cancer risk variables. At the first annual screen, 21% of the cancers found by mammography alone (in the mammography plus physical examination group) were 20 mm or more in size compared with 46% of those found by physical examination in the mammography plus physical examination group and 56% in the physical examination-only group. The corresponding percentages for screens 2-5 were 10%, 42%, and 50%, respectively. Screening detected 267 invasive breast cancers in the mammography plus physical examination group compared with 148 in the physical examination-only group. By December 31, 1993, 622 invasive and 71 in situ breast carcinomas were ascertained in the mammography plus physical examination group, and 610 and 16 were ascertained in the physical examination-only group. At 13-year follow-up, with 107 and 105 deaths from breast cancer in the respective groups, the cumulative rate ratio was 1.02 (95% confidence interval = 0.78-1.33).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In women aged 50-59 years, the addition of annual mammography screening to physical examination has no impact on breast cancer mortality.",

The excreted dose was thus less than 0.04% of the administered intravenous dose (range, 0.001%-0.04%; mean, 0.009% +/- 0.010) for all cases.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Less than 0.04% of administered gadopentetate dimeglumine is excreted into human breast milk. The amount transferred to a nursing infant orally would be far more than 100 times less than the permitted intravenous dose (200 micromol per kilogram of body weight) for neonates. The recommendation of a 24-hour suspension of breast-feeding for lactating women should thus be reconsidered.",

Cancers diagnosed after a negative mammogram are known as interval cancers. This study investigated whether mammographic breast density is related to the risk of interval cancer.",
        "Methods": "Subjects were selected from women participating in mammographic screening from 1988 through 1993 in a large health maintenance organization based in Seattle, WA. Women were eligible for the study if they had been diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer within 24 months of a screening mammogram and before a subsequent one. Interval cancer case subjects (n = 149) were women whose breast cancer occurred after a negative or benign mammographic assessment. Screen-detected control subjects (n = 388) were diagnosed after a positive screening mammogram. One radiologist, who was blinded to cancer status, assessed breast density by use of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mammographic sensitivity (i.e., the ability of mammography to detect a cancer) was 80% among women with predominantly fatty breasts but just 30% in women with extremely dense breasts. The odds ratio (OR) for interval cancer among women with extremely dense breasts was 6.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.95-19.4), compared with women with extremely fatty breasts, after adjustment for age at index mammogram, menopausal status, use of hormone replacement therapy, and body mass index. When only those interval cancer cases confirmed by retrospective review of index mammograms were considered, the OR increased to 9.47 (95% CI = 2.78-32.3).",

        "Methods": "We analyzed data from 5,925 pediatric HD patients, including 2,646 10-year and 755 20-year survivors, who were reported to 16 population-based cancer registries in North America and Europe between 1935 and 1994.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 157 solid tumors (observed/expected ratio [O/E] = 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 8.2.) and 26 acute leukemias (O/E = 27.4; 95% CI, 17.9 to 40. 2) were reported. Risk of solid tumors remained significantly increased among 20-year survivors (O/E = 6.6, observed [O] = 40, cumulative risk = 6.5%) and persisted for 25 years (O/E = 4.6, O = 15, cumulative risk = 11.7%). Temporal trends for cancers of thyroid, female breast, bone/connective tissue, stomach, and esophagus were consistent with the late effects of radiotherapy. Greater than 50-fold increased risks were observed for tumors of the thyroid and respiratory tract (one lung and one pleura) among children treated before age 10. At older ages (10 to 16 years), the largest number of second cancers occurred in the digestive tract (O/E = 19.3) and breast (O/E = 22.9). Risk of solid tumors increased with decreasing age at HD on a relative but not absolute scale.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Children and adolescents treated for HD experience significantly increased risks of second cancers at various sites for 2 to 3 decades. Although our results reflect the late effects of past therapeutic modalities, they underscore the importance of lifelong follow-up of pediatric HD patients given early, more aggressive treatments.",

Data collected from review of patient records included the patient's age and risk factors for breast cancer, aspiration or biopsy results (or both), follow-up imaging studies, and management recommendations.",
        "Results/Findings": "Management recommendations for complex cysts were 1-year follow-up in 13 patients, 6-month follow-up in 148, sonographically guided aspiration in 82, aspiration with possible core biopsy in 62, and excisional biopsy in three. No malignancies were diagnosed in the group treated with follow-up imaging, sonographically guided aspiration, or excisional biopsy. One malignancy, a papilloma with a 3-mm focus of ductal carcinoma in situ, was diagnosed in one of the patients who underwent core biopsy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Of the lesions classified as complex cysts, the malignancy rate was 0.3% (1/308). This malignancy rate is lower than that for lesions classified as probably benign using mammographic criteria (i.e., for lesions classified as category 3 lesions using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System). Because the accepted standard practice for management of probably benign lesions is follow-up studies, the low yield of malignancy in this series suggests that complex cysts can be managed with follow-up imaging studies instead of intervention.",

        "Results/Findings": "In 6113 asymptomatic women, 23 malignancies in 21 patients were detected with sonography only (prevalence, 0.31%). Five additional malignant lesions were found in patients with a malignant (n = 3) or a benign (n = 2) palpable or mammographically detected index lesion. The mean size of invasive malignancies detected only by sonography was 9.1 mm, which was not significantly different from the mean size of invasive cancers detected by mammography (p = .07). The sensitivity of the prospective sonographic classification for malignancy was 100%, and the specificity was 33.5%.",

We assessed the validity of both models by employing data from women enrolled in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial.",
        "Methods": "We used data from 5969 white women who were at least 35 years of age and without a history of breast cancer. These women were in the placebo arm of the trial and were screened annually. The average follow-up period was 48.4 months. We compared the observed number of breast cancers with the predicted numbers from the models.",
        "Results/Findings": "In terms of absolute risk, the ratios of total expected to observed numbers of cancers (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 0.84 (0. 73-0.97) for model 1 and 1.03 (0.88-1.21) for model 2, respectively. Within the age groups of 49 years or less, 50-59 years, and 60 years or more, the ratios of expected to observed numbers of breast cancers (95% CIs) for model 1 were 0.91 (0.73-1.14), 0.96 (0.73-1. 28), and 0.66 (0.52-0.86), respectively. Thus, model 1 underestimated breast cancer risk in women more than 59 years of age. For model 2, the risk ratios (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.72-1.22), 1.13 (0.83-1.55), and 1.05 (0.80-1.41), respectively.

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer-susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have recently been identified on the human genome. Women who carry a mutation of one of these genes have a greatly increased chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and they usually develop the disease at a much younger age, compared with normal individuals. Women can be tested to see whether they are carriers. A woman who undergoes genetic counseling before testing can be told the probabilities that she is a carrier, given her family history. In this paper we develop a model for evaluating the probabilities that a woman is a carrier of a mutation of BRCA1 and BRCA2, on the basis of her family history of breast and ovarian cancer in first- and second-degree relatives. Of special importance are the relationships of the family members with cancer, the ages at onset of the diseases, and the ages of family members who do not have the diseases. This information can be elicited during genetic counseling and prior to genetic testing. The carrier probabilities are obtained from Bayes's rule, by use of family history as the evidence and by use of the mutation prevalences as the prior distribution. In addressing an individual's carrier probabilities, we incorporate uncertainty about some of the key inputs of the model, such as the age-specific incidence of diseases and the overall prevalence of mutations. There is some evidence that other, undiscovered genes may be important in explaining familial breast cancer. Users of the current version of the model should be aware of this limitation. The methodology that we describe can be extended to more than two genes, should data become available about other genes.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Axillary masses are uncommon alterations when detected as an isolated finding. We evaluated 31 patients with isolated axillary masses. Patients with alterations of the breasts or the upper limbs or with Ipsilateral chest lesions were excluded from the study. Nine patients had occult breast cancer, 5 of them in the contralateral breast. Seven had metastatic lymph nodes of non-ductal origin, and 1 had carcinoma of apocrine cells with metastasis to the axilla. Four patients had benign lymphadenopathy which disappeared spontaneously, and 4 others had ruptured infundibular follicular cyst, nodular fibromatosis, inflammatory tuberculous and inflammatory rheumatoid lymphadenitis. Five had an ectopic breast (2 with a fibroadenoma and 3 with fibrocystic changes). One patient had an axillary lipoma. The mean age of patients with malignant pathology was 55.1 +/- 10.9 years, and the mean age of patients with a benign pathology was 43.1 +/- 14.7 (P < 0.01). Chest X-ray and bilateral mammography are useful when the cause of the mass cannot be determined by taking a detailed history of neoplastic or infectious antecedents, by careful physical examination of the skin of the arms, trunk and neck, or by palpation of the breasts and thyroid. Fine needle aspiration biopsy distinguishes between benign and malignant pathologies. In cases of indeterminate neoplasia, complete axillary dissection for diagnosis is indicated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of this study was to determine the cause and frequency of axillary abnormalities seen mammographically and to evaluate the imaging characteristics of lymphadenopathy that are associated with malignancy.",
        "Methods": "Ninety-six axillary abnormalities seen mammographically in 94 patients were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the clinical diagnoses and pathologic results found in the medical records. For each abnormality, the length, margins, and presence of microcalcifications were noted. Logistic regression was used to determine an association between these findings and status (benign or malignant).",
        "Results/Findings": "Seventy-six of 94 patients had lymphadenopathy. Eighteen of 94 patients had an abnormality other than lymphadenopathy. Because two of these 94 patients had more than one abnormality, a total of 96 abnormalities occurred, 20 of which were due to an abnormality other than lymphadenopathy. Regarding the 76 cases of lymphadenopathy, the most frequent diagnosis was nonspecific benign lymphadenopathy in 29% (n = 22) of cases, followed by metastatic breast cancer in 26% (n = 20) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma in 17% (n = 13). Other causes (n = 21) included collagen vascular disease, lymphomas other than well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, metastatic disease from nonbreast primary site, metastatic disease from unknown primary site, sarcoidosis. HIV-related lymphadenopathy, and reactive lymphadenopathy associated with a breast abscess. An association between length of nonfatty lymph nodes and malignant status was statistically significant at the .001 level. When a length greater than 33 mm was used as a predictor of malignancy, the specificity and sensitivity were 97% and 31%, respectively. We found an association between malignancy and nonfatty lymph nodes with ill-defined or spiculated margins (p = .053). Regarding the 20 abnormalities other than lymphadenopathy, epidermal cysts (n = 7) were most prevalent.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The most common axillary abnormality revealed on mammography was abnormal lymph nodes. Homogeneously dense (nonfatty) axillary lymph nodes were strongly associated with malignancy when the lymph nodes were longer than 33 mm, had ill-defined or spiculated margins, or contained intranodal microcalcifications. However, our study confirmed that in most cases benign and malignant lymph nodes cannot be distinguished from each other mammographically.",

In 1975, breast cancer screening was started in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, for women aged 35-65 years. Since 1977, approximately 7700 older women have also been invited for biennial one-view mammography. This report is based on ten screening rounds from 1975 to 1994. The results of the subsequent screening rounds in the age groups 65-69 years, 70-74 years and 75 years and older were: participation rates 55%, 39% and 15%; screen-detected cancer rates 5.6%, 6.9% and 7.8%; interval cancer rates 2.0%, 1.8%, and 3.5%; and predictive values of referral 62%, 64% and 62% respectively. In all age groups, screen-detected patients had smaller tumours and a lower prevalence of axillary lymph node involvement than unscreened patients. Our conclusion is that, in women aged 65 years, and older, breast cancer can be detected at an earlier stage by mammographic screening.",

        "Methods": "The Late Effects Study Group followed a cohort of 1380 children with Hodgkin's disease to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and the risk factors associated with them.",
        "Results/Findings": "In this cohort, there were 88 second neoplasms as compared with 4.4 expected in the general population (standardized incidence ratio, 18.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 14.3 to 22.3). The estimated actuarial incidence of any second neoplasm 15 years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was 7.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.2 to 8.8 percent); the incidence of solid tumors was 3.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 5.5 percent). Breast cancer was the most common solid tumor (standardized incidence ratio 75.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 118.4), with an estimated actuarial incidence in women that approached 35 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 52.6 percent) by 40 years of age. Older age (10 to 16 vs. <10 years) at the time of radiation treatment (relative risk, 1.9) and a higher dose (2000 to 4000 vs. <2000 cGy) of radiation (relative risk, 5.9) were associated with significantly increased risk of breast cancer. The estimated actuarial incidence of leukemia reached a plateau of 2.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 4.8 percent) 14 years after diagnosis. Treatment with alkylating agents, older age at the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, recurrence of Hodgkin's disease, and a late stage of disease at diagnosis were risk factors for leukemia.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The risk of solid tumors, especially breast cancer, is high among women who were treated with radiation for childhood Hodgkin's disease. Systematic screening for breast cancer could be important in the health care of such women.",

Risks for breast cancer incidence and mortality were calculated by comparison with expected rates for a general female population matched by age and race.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Twenty-five patients have developed invasive breast cancer, yielding a relative risk (RR) of 4.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5-5.7). An additional patient developed multifocal carcinoma in situ. Age at irradiation strongly influenced risk: RR was 136 for women treated before 15 years of age (95% CI = 34-371). RR declined with age at irradiation (P for trend < .0001), but the elevation remained statistically significant for subjects less than 30 years old at the time of irradiation (for those 15-24, RR = 19 [95% CI = 10.3-32]; for those 24-29, RR = 7 [95% CI = 3.2-14.4]). In women above 30 years of age, the risk was not elevated (RR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.2-1.8). Risk of breast cancer increased significantly with time since treatment (P for trend < .0001). The RR was 2.0 (95% CI = 1.0-3.5) with follow-up under 15 years and 13.6 (95% CI = 7.9-18.2) with follow-up equal to or exceeding 15 years. The addition of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone chemotherapy to irradiation increased the risk within the first 15 years. Most breast cancers (22 of 26) arose within or at the margin of the radiation field and were infiltrating ductal carcinomas. Stage distribution and outcome suggest that the increased incidence was not solely attributable to vigilant screening. RR of death from breast cancer was 5.1 (95% CI = 2.2-10.0).",

Of the 115 patients in the spontaneous and 25 patients in the provoked groups who underwent biopsy, the most frequent cause of nipple discharge was intraductal papilloma (47.8 percent). Nipple discharge was the result of carcinoma in 35 patients (14.4 percent) in the spontaneous and six patients (2.9 percent) in the provoked group, respectively. In patients with a palpable mass, the incidence of carcinoma was 61.5 percent compared with 6.1 percent in patients with nipple discharge only.

The definition of intraductal spreading of carcinoma becomes an important factor in the decision making process, but little is known about how much intraductal extension influences the spreading of tumor in the whole breast. To define any unfavorable pathologic factors existing in limited surgery for patients with DCIS, the authors investigated histopathologic characteristics using a sequential slicing of tissues.",
        "Methods": "Duct-lobular segmentectomy, a limited surgery, was performed on 110 patients with a bloody nipple discharge. Six patients with invasive carcinoma and 17 patients with DCIS subsequently received a total mastectomy. The specimens obtained by segmentectomy and mastectomy were histopathologically examined. Using subserial sections, the authors examined the relationship between intraductal spreading of carcinoma in the segmentectomy specimens and carcinoma residue in the mastectomy specimens.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 16 mastectomy specimens, the authors found residual DCIS in 6, and atypical ductal hyperplasia in 4. Intraductal spreading of carcinoma was detected in 8 of 16 segmentectomy specimens. Six of eight patients with intraductal spreading had residual DCIS. The other two patients had atypical hyperplasia in breasts. No residual DCIS was detected in the other eight patients without intraductal spreading. Among 12 patients under observation who did not have a mastectomy, invasive carcinoma subsequently developed in 3. Two of three patients had intraductal spreading in segmentectomy specimens. Only 1 of 10 patients without intraductal spreading, however, developed carcinoma.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In a series of 8,703 breast operations, nipple discharge was the presenting symptom in 7.4% of cases. It is even more common in the office and clinic since many discharges can be treated medically. To be significant, a discharge should be true, spontaneous, persistent, and nonlactational. Of the 7 basic types, i.e., milky, multicolored and sticky, purulent, clear (watery), yellow (serous), pink (serosanguineous), and bloody (sanguineous), the last 4 are the surgically significant ones. Of the 586 patients operated on for one of these types of discharge, the majority had a benign etiology, i.e., intraductal papillomata (48.1%) and fibrocystic changes (32.9%), but 14.3% were due to cancer and another 7.3% to precancerous mastopathy. In the 84 patients with cancers, the false-negative rate for mammography was 9.5% and was 17.8% for cytology. There was no palpable mass in 13.1% of patients. There was an increasing likelihood of the discharge being due to cancer when the discharge was, in order of increasing frequency, yellow, pink, bloody, or watery, when it was accompanied by a lump, when it was unilateral and from a single duct, when the mammogram or galactogram and the cytology were positive, and when the patient was over 50 years of age. Milky discharges are usually treated medically unless they are due to a pituitary adenoma. If the cause cannot be found and eradicated, bromocriptine is the drug of choice. Multicolored sticky discharges are also treated medically, chiefly by nipple hygiene, except when advanced. Purulent discharges are treated with appropriate antibiotics but abscesses need drainage and a biopsy of the wall. Except in women under 35 years of age or in those anxious to have children, surgically significant discharges are treated by central duct excision. Good cosmetic results can be obtained with careful technique and the danger of a recurrent discharge is eliminated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To assist in medical counseling, we present a method to estimate the chance that a woman with given age and risk factors will develop breast cancer over a specified interval. The risk factors used were age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of previous biopsies, and number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer. A model of relative risks for various combinations of these factors was developed from case-control data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP). The model allowed for the fact that relative risks associated with previous breast biopsies were smaller for women aged 50 or more than for younger women. Thus, the proportional hazards models for those under age 50 and for those of age 50 or more. The baseline age-specific hazard rate, which is the rate for a patient without identified risk factors, is computed as the product of the observed age-specific composite hazard rate times the quantity 1 minus the attributable risk. We calculated individualized breast cancer probabilities from information on relative risks and the baseline hazard rate. These calculations take competing risks and the interval of risk into account. Our data were derived from women who participated in the BCDDP and who tended to return for periodic examinations. For this reason, the risk projections given are probably most reliable for counseling women who plan to be examined about once a year.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To characterize the clinical and pathologic features of patients who developed breast cancer (BC) after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (HD). Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that women who are cured of HD have an increased risk of developing BC.",
        "Methods": "The clinical data, mammograms, and pathologic specimens of 37 women who developed 45 BCs (eight bilateral events), and had a prior history of treatment for HD were analyzed.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median age at diagnosis of HD was 27 years (range, 11 to 60). All patients received radiotherapy (RT) to the upper part of their body, and 10 also had chemotherapy for HD. The median interval from the treatment of HD to the diagnosis of BC was 15 years (range, 8 to 34). The median age at diagnosis of BC was 43 years (range, 27 to 75), 41% of patients were 39 years old or younger. Most mammograms (81%) showed abnormal findings of mass and/or microcalcifications. Of the eight patients (22%) with bilateral tumors, four were synchronous and four were metachronous. Involvement of the medial half of the breast occurred more frequently than in patients with primary BC (39% and 21%, respectively; P < .002). But, the histologic types, grades, presence of lymphocytic reaction, and lymphatic invasion were similar to those observed in 935 primary BC patients who were previously analyzed at our center. The 6-year actuarial relapse-free survival (RFS) for node-negative BC after HD was 85%. Node-positive patients had a significantly lower RFS of 33% (P = .002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In comparison to patients with primary BC, patients who develop BC after HD are more likely to be younger, have bilateral disease, and have their tumors more frequently involve the medial half of the breast. Pathologic characteristics, nodal involvement, and prognosis are similar to those of primary BC. BC in women who were treated for HD is becoming an increasing problem, as more patients cured of HD reach a follow-up time of 10 to 15 years. Breast examination and mammography at an early age should be part of the follow-up program for women who are cured of HD.",
