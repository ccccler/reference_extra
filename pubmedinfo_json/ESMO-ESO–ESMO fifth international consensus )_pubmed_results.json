        "Background/Purpose": "To our knowledge, WSG-ADAPT-HR+/HER2- (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ; n = 5,625 registered) is the first trial combining the 21-gene expression assay (recurrence score [RS]) and response to 3-week preoperative endocrine therapy (ET) to guide systemic therapy in early breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Baseline and postendocrine Ki67 (Ki67 ) were evaluated centrally. In the endocrine trial, all patients received exclusively ET: patients with pathologic regional lymph node status (pN) 0-1 (ie, 0-3 involved lymph nodes) entered control arm if RS ≤ 11 and experimental arm if RS12-25 with ET response (Ki67  ≤ 10%). All other patients (including N0-1 RS12-25   ET response) received dose-dense chemotherapy (CT) followed by ET in the CT trial. Primary end point of the endocrine trial was noninferiority of 5-year invasive disease-free survival (5y-iDFS) in experimental (  control) arm; secondary end points included distant DFS, overall survival, and translational research.",
        "Results/Findings": "Intention-to-treat population comprised 2,290 patients (n = 1,422 experimental   n = 868 control): 26.3% versus 34.6% premenopausal and 27.4% versus 24.0% pN1. One-sided 95% lower confidence limit of the 5y-iDFS difference was -3.3%, establishing prespecified noninferiority (  = .05). 5y-iDFS was 92.6% (95% CI, 90.8 to 94.0) in experimental versus 93.9% (95% CI, 91.8 to 95.4) in control arm; 5-year distant DFS was 95.6% versus 96.3%, and 5-year overall survival 97.3% versus 98.0%, respectively. Differences were similar in age and nodal subgroups. In N0-1 RS12-25, outcome of ET responders (ET alone) was comparable with that of ET nonresponders (CT) for age > 50 years and superior for age ≤ 50 years. ET response was more likely with aromatase inhibitors (mostly postmenopausal) than with tamoxifen (mostly premenopausal): 78.1% versus 41.1% (  < .001). ET response was 78.8% in RS0-11, 62.2% in RS12-25, and 32.7% in RS > 25 (n = 4,203,   < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "WSG-ADAPT-HR+/HER2- demonstrates that guiding systemic treatment by both RS and ET response is feasible in clinical routine and spares CT in pre- and postmenopausal patients with ≤ 3 involved lymph nodes.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The recurrence score based on the 21-gene breast-cancer assay has been clinically useful in predicting a chemotherapy benefit in hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, axillary lymph-node-negative breast cancer. In women with positive lymph-node disease, the role of the recurrence score with respect to predicting a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear.",
        "Methods": "In a prospective trial, we randomly assigned women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, and a recurrence score of 25 or lower (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis) to endocrine therapy only or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy. The primary objective was to determine the effect of chemotherapy on invasive disease-free survival and whether the effect was influenced by the recurrence score. Secondary end points included distant relapse-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 5083 women (33.2% premenopausal and 66.8% postmenopausal) underwent randomization, and 5018 participated in the trial. At the prespecified third interim analysis, the chemotherapy benefit with respect to increasing invasive disease-free survival differed according to menopausal status (P = 0.008 for the comparison of chemotherapy benefit in premenopausal and postmenopausal participants), and separate prespecified analyses were conducted. Among postmenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.9% in the endocrine-only group and 91.3% in the chemoendocrine group, with no chemotherapy benefit (hazard ratio for invasive disease recurrence, new primary cancer [breast cancer or another type], or death, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.26; P = 0.89). Among premenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 89.0% with endocrine-only therapy and 93.9% with chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.83; P = 0.002), with a similar increase in distant relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87; P = 0.009). The relative chemotherapy benefit did not increase as the recurrence score increased.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among premenopausal women with one to three positive lymph nodes and a recurrence score of 25 or lower, those who received chemoendocrine therapy had longer invasive disease-free survival and distant relapse-free survival than those who received endocrine-only therapy, whereas postmenopausal women with similar characteristics did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

Here, we present results of the prespecified primary outcome analysis and an additional follow-up analysis.",
        "Methods": "This global, phase III, open-label trial randomized (1 : 1) 5637 patients to adjuvant ET for ≥5 years ± abemaciclib for 2 years. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with ≥4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), or 1-3 positive ALNs and either grade 3 disease or tumor ≥5 cm. Cohort 2 enrolled patients with 1-3 positive ALNs and centrally determined high Ki-67 index (≥20%). The primary endpoint was IDFS in the intent-to-treat population (cohorts 1 and 2). Secondary endpoints were IDFS in patients with high Ki-67, DRFS, overall survival, and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "At the primary outcome analysis, with 19 months median follow-up time, abemaciclib + ET resulted in a 29% reduction in the risk of developing an IDFS event [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.87; nominal P = 0.0009]. At the additional follow-up analysis, with 27 months median follow-up and 90% of patients off treatment, IDFS (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82; nominal P < 0.0001) and DRFS (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83; nominal P < 0.0001) benefit was maintained. The absolute improvements in 3-year IDFS and DRFS rates were 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Whereas Ki-67 index was prognostic, abemaciclib benefit was consistent regardless of Ki-67 index. Safety data were consistent with the known abemaciclib risk profile.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Abemaciclib + ET significantly improved IDFS in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer, with an acceptable safety profile. Ki-67 index was prognostic, but abemaciclib benefit was observed regardless of Ki-67 index. Overall, the robust treatment benefit of abemaciclib extended beyond the 2-year treatment period.",

        "Methods": "Young, Empowered and Strong (YES) is an interactive web-based intervention designed to engage young women with personalized education and symptom self-management resources on the basis of responses to patient-reported outcome-based questionnaires. We piloted YES among young women (< 45 years) with newly diagnosed early breast cancer (EBC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and breast cancer survivors (BCSs). Assessments were deployed weekly (EBC and MBC) or every 4 weeks (BCSs) over 12 weeks. At study completion, use, feasibility, and acceptability of YES were evaluated via a survey and semistructured interview.",
        "Results/Findings": "Thirty women were enrolled between April and June 2019: 10 EBC, 10 BCSs, and 10 MBC. The mean age at diagnosis and enrollment was 36 (range 25-44) and 39 (range 31-44) years, respectively. Most participants were actively treated (96%, 27 of 28) with endocrine therapy (54%, 15 of 28) or chemotherapy (43%, 12 of 28). Overall, 61% (180 of 296) of assessments were completed (EBC: 70%, BCSs: 63%, and MBC: 52%). Of 37 patient-reported outcome and need domains, the most frequently triggered were sexual health (EBC: 90%, BCSs: 90%, and MBC: 90%), anxiety (EBC: 80%, BCSs: 90%, and MBC: 90%), stress and mindfulness (EBC: 80%, BCSs: 90%, and MBC: 90%), and fatigue (EBC: 90%, BCSs: 80%, and MBC: 90%). On postpilot survey, participants reported that YES helped them to learn (50%, 7 of 14), monitor (43%, 6 of 14), and manage (57%, 8 of 14) their symptoms.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "YES is a feasible and acceptable digital intervention to support young women across the breast cancer care continuum. The nearly universal triggering of sexual and mental health needs suggests suboptimal management in the clinical setting and the potential for self-management through a digital platform.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality.",
        "Methods": "We did a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials assessing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus the same chemotherapy alone. Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs).",
        "Results/Findings": "Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p<0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p<0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p<0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p<0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p<0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, -0·3 to 1·1; p=0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0-1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2-4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5-9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1-3, and N4+ disease).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional reductions irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.",

Preclinical models support the use of platinum agents in the TNBC basal subtype. The EA1131 trial hypothesized that invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) would not be inferior but improved in patients with basal subtype TNBC treated with adjuvant platinum compared with capecitabine.",
        "Methods": "Patients with clinical stage II or III TNBC with ≥ 1 cm RD in the breast post-NAC were randomly assigned to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles or capecitabine 14 out of 21 days every 3 weeks for six cycles. TNBC subtype (basal   nonbasal) was determined by PAM50 in the residual disease. A noninferiority design with superiority alternative was chosen, assuming a 4-year iDFS of 67% with capecitabine.",
        "Results/Findings": "Four hundred ten of planned 775 participants were randomly assigned to platinum or capecitabine between 2015 and 2021. After median follow-up of 20 months and 120 iDFS events (61% of full information) in the 308 (78%) patients with basal subtype TNBC, the 3-year iDFS for platinum was 42% (95% CI, 30 to 53) versus 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) for capecitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were more common with platinum agents. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial as it was unlikely that further follow-up would show noninferiority or superiority of platinum.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Platinum agents do not improve outcomes in patients with basal subtype TNBC RD post-NAC and are associated with more severe toxicity when compared with capecitabine. Participants had a lower than expected 3-year iDFS regardless of study treatment, highlighting the need for better therapies in this high-risk population.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women. In contrast, male BC is about 100 times less common than in women, being considered a rare disease. Male BC may be a distinctive subtype of BC and available data seems to indicate that male BC has a higher dependence on genetic variants than female BC. Nevertheless, the same prognostic and predictive markers are used to determine optimal management strategies for both male and female BC. Several studies have assessed the role of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes in female BC susceptibility. However, data on male BC is scarce. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the role of SNPs in XRCC1, MUTYH and TP53 genes in a male cohort of BC, and, in addition, compare the male data with matched results previously genotyped in female BC patients.",

        "Results/Findings": "The results obtained indicate significant differences in BC susceptibility between males and females for the XRCC1 rs1799782, MUTYH rs3219489 and TP53 rs1042522 and rs8064946 variants.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In males, XRCC1 and TP53 variants, when in heterozygosity, seem to be related with lower susceptibility for BC, contrasting with higher susceptibility for a MUTYH variant in females. These findings may help to explain the difference in incidence of BC between the two sexes.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly being used to treat early-stage triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor 2-overexpressing breast cancers, as well as locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers. The rationales for neoadjuvant therapy are to shrink tumor size and potentially decrease the extent of surgery, to serve as an in vivo test of response to therapy, and to reveal prognostic information for the patient. MRI is the most accurate modality to demonstrate response to therapy and to help ensure accurate presurgical planning. Changes in lesion diameter, volume, and enhancement are used to predict complete response, partial response, or nonresponse to therapy. However, residual disease may be overestimated or underestimated at MRI. Fibrosis, necrotic tumors, and residual benign masses may be causes of overestimation of residual disease. Nonmass lesions, invasive lobular carcinoma, hormone receptor-positive tumors, nonconcentric shrinkage patterns, the use of antiangiogenic therapy, and late-enhancing foci may be causes of underestimation of residual disease. In patients with known axillary lymph node metastasis, neoadjuvant therapy may be followed by targeted axillary dissection to avoid the potential morbidity associated with an axillary lymph node dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging, radiomics, machine learning, and deep learning methods are under investigation to improve MRI accuracy in predicting treatment response. RSNA, 2021.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women aged less than 40 years and the second most common cause of cancer death in this age group. Global rates of young onset breast cancer have risen steadily over the last twenty years. Although young women with breast cancer have a higher frequency of underlying pathogenic mutations in high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes (CSG) than older women, the vast majority of young breast cancer patients are not found to have a germline CSG mutation. There is therefore a need to inform young women regarding non-genetic breast cancer risk factors which have the potential to be influenced by changes in individual behaviour. A Pubmed search was performed using the search terms \"young\" or \"early onset\", and \"breast cancer\" and \"modifiable risk\". Titles and abstracts from peer-reviewed publications were screened for relevance. This review presents evidence for potentially modifiable risk factors of breast cancer risk in young women, including lifestyle factors (physical activity, body habitus, alcohol use, smoking, shift work and socioeconomic factors), reproductive and hormonal factors and iatrogenic risks. The extent to which these factors are truly modifiable is discussed and interactions between genetic and non-genetic risk factors are also addressed. Health care professionals have an opportunity to inform young women about breast health and risk when presenting at a \"teachable moment\", including the benefits of physical activity and alcohol habits as risk factor. More focussed discussions regarding individual personal risk and benefit should accompany conversations regarding reproductive health and take into consideration both non-modifiable and iatrogenic BC risk factors.",

        "Methods": "PENELOPE-B ( ) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study in women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative primary breast cancer without a pathological complete response after taxane-containing NACT and at high risk of relapse (clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading score ≥ 3 or 2 and ypN+). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 13 cycles of palbociclib 125 mg once daily or placebo on days 1-21 in a 28-day cycle in addition to endocrine therapy (ET).

        "Results/Findings": "One thousand two hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned. The median age was 49.0 years (range, 19-79), and the majority were ypN+ with Ki-67 ≤ 15%; 59.4% of patients had a clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading score ≥ 3. 50.1% received aromatase inhibitor, and 33% of premenopausal women received a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog in addition to either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. After a median follow-up of 42.8 months (92% complete), 308 events were confirmed. Palbociclib did not improve iDFS versus placebo added to ET-stratified hazard ratio, 0.93 (95% repeated CI, 0.74 to 1.17) and two-sided weighted log-rank test (Cui, Hung, and Wang)   = .525. There was no difference among the subgroups. Most common related serious adverse events were infections and vascular disorders in 113 (9.1%) patients with no difference between the treatment arms. Eight fatal serious adverse events (two palbociclib and six placebo) were reported.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The demand for genetic testing of hereditary breast cancer genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 has continued to increase with the lowering costs of testing, raised awareness in the general public, and implications for breast cancer treatment when a patient is identified as having a germline pathogenic variant. Historically within Australia, patients affected by high genetic risk breast cancers have been referred to a familial cancer centre (FCC) for assessment and testing, resulting in wait times for an appointment for pre- and post-test genetic counselling and an increased demand on the public-funded FCC. To improve patient access and pace of genetic testing, as well as refocus FCC resources, a mainstream clinical genetic testing program was rolled out in September 2017 through the Parkville FCC (PFCC) in Australia at 10 hospital sites. This program enables specialist doctors of eligible patients affected by breast cancer to arrange genetic testing directly at an oncology/surgical appointment and follow up the results as part of the patients' routine clinical care. In this model, the specialist doctor is responsible for any treatment implications of the genetic test result, and the PFCC is responsible for result interpretation, future cancer risk, family cascade testing and segregation testing where warranted. To date the program has had successful uptake, a notable pathogenic variant detection rate, reduced the burden on the PFCC enabling a reallocation of resources and has streamlined the process of genetic testing for eligible patients. Investigation into the patient and clinician experiences of the mainstream program is required.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The MINDACT trial showed excellent 5-year distant metastasis-free survival of 94·7% (95% CI 92·5-96·2) in patients with breast cancer of high clinical and low genomic risk who did not receive chemotherapy. We present long-term follow-up results together with an exploratory analysis by age.",
        "Methods": "MINDACT was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 112 academic and community hospitals in nine European countries. Patients aged 18-70 years, with histologically confirmed primary invasive breast cancer (stage T1, T2, or operable T3) with up to three positive lymph nodes, no distant metastases, and a WHO performance status of 0-1 were enrolled and their genomic risk (using the MammaPrint 70-gene signature) and clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online) were determined. Patients with low clinical and low genomic risk results did not receive chemotherapy, and patients with high clinical and high genomic risk did receive chemotherapy (mostly anthracycline-based or taxane-based, or a combination thereof). Patients with discordant risk results (ie, patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, and those with low clinical risk but high genomic risk) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy or not based on either the clinical risk or the genomic risk. Randomisation was done centrally and used a minimisation technique that was stratified by institution, risk group, and clinical-pathological characteristics. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was to test whether the distant metastasis-free survival rate at 5 years in patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk not receiving chemotherapy had a lower boundary of the 95% CI above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%. In the primary test population of patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who adhered to the treatment allocation of no chemotherapy and had no change in risk post-enrolment. Here, we present updated follow-up as well as an exploratory analysis of a potential age effect (≤50 years vs >50 years) and an analysis by nodal status for patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative disease. These analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and the European Clinical Trials database, EudraCT2005-002625-31. Recruitment is complete and further long-term follow-up is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 8, 2007, and July 11, 2011, 6693 patients were enrolled. On Feb 26, 2020, median follow-up was 8·7 years (IQR 7·8-9·7). The updated 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate for patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk receiving no chemotherapy (primary test population, n=644) was 95·1% (95% CI 93·1-96·6), which is above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%, supporting the previous analysis and proving MINDACT as a positive de-escalation trial. Patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (n=749) or not (n=748); this was the intention-to-treat population. The 8-year estimates for distant metastasis-free survival in the intention-to-treat population were 92·0% (95% CI 89·6-93·8) for chemotherapy versus 89·4% (86·8-91·5) for no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0·66; 95% CI 0·48-0·92). An exploratory analysis confined to the subset of patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease (1358 [90.7%] of 1497 randomly assigned patients, of whom 676 received chemotherapy and 682 did not) shows different effects of chemotherapy administration on 8-year distant metastasis-free survival according to age: 93·6% (95% CI 89·3-96·3) with chemotherapy versus 88·6% (83·5-92·3) without chemotherapy in 464 women aged 50 years or younger (absolute difference 5·0 percentage points [SE 2·8, 95% CI -0·5 to 10·4]) and 90·2% (86·8-92·7) versus 90·0% (86·6-92·6) in 894 women older than 50 years (absolute difference 0·2 percentage points [2·1, -4·0 to 4·4]). The 8-year distant metastasis-free survival in the exploratory analysis by nodal status in these patients was 91·7% (95% CI 88·1-94·3) with chemotherapy and 89·2% (85·2-92·2) without chemotherapy in 699 node-negative patients (absolute difference 2·5 percentage points [SE 2·3, 95% CI -2·1 to 7·2]) and 91·2% (87·2-94·0) versus 89·9% (85·8-92·8) for 658 patients with one to three positive nodes (absolute difference 1·3 percentage points [2·4, -3·5 to 6·1]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With a more mature follow-up approaching 9 years, the 70-gene signature shows an intact ability of identifying among women with high clinical risk, a subgroup, namely patients with a low genomic risk, with an excellent distant metastasis-free survival when treated with endocrine therapy alone. For these women the magnitude of the benefit from adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy remains small (2·6 percentage points) and is not enhanced by nodal positivity. However, in an underpowered exploratory analysis this benefit appears to be age-dependent, as it is only seen in women younger than 50 years where it reaches a clinically relevant threshold of 5 percentage points. Although, possibly due to chemotherapy-induced ovarian function suppression, it should be part of informed, shared decision making. Further study is needed in younger women, who might need reinforced endocrine therapy to forego chemotherapy.",

Efficacy was similar in all body mass index categories. Tumors with Ki-67 above the median level of 10% had a greater benefit (HR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.81) than those with Ki-67 ≤10% (HR = 1.58; 95% CI, 0.45-5.60;     = 0.04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The efficacy of low-dose tamoxifen seems to be greater in postmenopausal women and in women with lower estradiol levels. Benefits appear to be larger also in women with menopausal symptoms, never smokers, and tumors with Ki-67 >10%. Our results by menopausal status provide important insight into low-dose tamoxifen personalized treatment, although caution is necessary given their exploratory nature. Observation of an improved response in tumors with Ki-67 >10% is consistent but the use of the marker in this setting is investigational. .",

Understanding factors associated with adherence may help inform efforts to improve use of AET as prescribed. The present systematic review examined potentially modifiable factors associated with adherence to AET in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42019124200). All studies were included, whether factors were significantly associated with adherence or results were null. This review also accounted for the frequency with which a potentially modifiable factor was examined and whether univariate or multivariate models were used. This review also examined whether methodological or sample characteristics were associated with the likelihood of a factor being associated with AET adherence. A total of 68 articles were included. Potentially modifiable factors were grouped into six categories: side effects, attitudes toward AET, psychological factors, healthcare provider-related factors, sociocultural factors, and general/quality of life factors. Side effects were less likely to be associated with adherence in studies with retrospective or cross-sectional than prospective designs. Self-efficacy (psychological factor) and positive decisional balance (attitude toward AET) were the only potentially modifiable factors examined ≥10 times and associated with adherence or persistence ≥75% of the time in both univariate and multivariate models. Self-efficacy and decisional balance (i.e., weight of pros vs. cons) were the potentially modifiable factors most consistently associated with adherence, and hence may be worth focusing on as targets for interventions to improve AET adherence among breast cancer survivors.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy should be managed by a multidisciplinary care team. Appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy include patients with inflammatory breast cancer and those in whom residual disease may prompt a change in therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy can also be used to reduce the extent of local therapy or reduce delays in initiating therapy. Although tumor histology, grade, stage, and estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression should routinely be used to guide clinical decisions, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of other markers or genomic profiles. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have clinically node-positive and/or at least T1c disease should be offered an anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen; those with cT1a or cT1bN0 TNBC should not routinely be offered neoadjuvant therapy. Carboplatin may be offered to patients with TNBC to increase pathologic complete response. There is currently insufficient evidence to support adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to standard chemotherapy. In patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR-positive), HER2-negative tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used when a treatment decision can be made without surgical information. Among postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, hormone therapy can be used to downstage disease. Patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease should be offered neoadjuvant therapy in combination with anti-HER2-positive therapy.

        "Background/Purpose": "Population-based estimates of the risk of breast cancer associated with germline pathogenic variants in cancer-predisposition genes are critically needed for risk assessment and management in women with inherited pathogenic variants.",
        "Methods": "In a population-based case-control study, we performed sequencing using a custom multigene amplicon-based panel to identify germline pathogenic variants in 28 cancer-predisposition genes among 32,247 women with breast cancer (case patients) and 32,544 unaffected women (controls) from population-based studies in the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium. Associations between pathogenic variants in each gene and the risk of breast cancer were assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Pathogenic variants in 12 established breast cancer-predisposition genes were detected in 5.03% of case patients and in 1.63% of controls. Pathogenic variants in   and   were associated with a high risk of breast cancer, with odds ratios of 7.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.33 to 11.27) and 5.23 (95% CI, 4.09 to 6.77), respectively. Pathogenic variants in   were associated with a moderate risk (odds ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 2.68 to 5.63). Pathogenic variants in  ,  , and   were associated with increased risks of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, whereas pathogenic variants in  ,  , and   were associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Pathogenic variants in 16 candidate breast cancer-predisposition genes, including the c.657_661del5 founder pathogenic variant in  , were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study provides estimates of the prevalence and risk of breast cancer associated with pathogenic variants in known breast cancer-predisposition genes in the U.S. population. These estimates can inform cancer testing and screening and improve clinical management strategies for women in the general population with inherited pathogenic variants in these genes.

        "Background/Purpose": "In Europe, inappropriate reimbursement and funding rules and regulations act as disincentives to best breast cancer care or, at worst, hinder best care. This problem was the focus of the 12th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC) manifesto, discussed during the virtual conference. As patient involvement is indispensable in driving changes to clinical practice, Europa Donna the European patient advocacy group was closely involved in the 12th manifesto. Reimbursement policies have rarely evolved with advances in breast cancer care such as outpatient (ambulatory) care rather than inpatient admission, use of oral or subcutaneous anti-cancer drugs rather than day-hospital intravenous administration, oncoplastic surgery techniques to minimize mastectomy rates, breast reconstructive surgery, risk-reducing surgery for BRCA mutation carriers, or use of hypo-fractionated breast radiation therapy. Although each European country, region and centre will have to understand how their reimbursement policies may hinder best care and find their own solutions, the problems are similar throughout Europe and some solutions can be broadly applied. This manifesto is not calling for more funding or demanding changes that will result in more expensive care. Reimbursement, if better aligned with guidelines and optimal clinical practice, will deliver more cost-effective healthcare. This will release resources, support more equitable use of finite funding and resources, so allowing more European breast cancer patients to benefit from evidence-based treatment recommended by national and international guidelines.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Palbociclib added to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer. The PALLAS trial aimed to investigate whether the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival over endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "PALLAS is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 406 cancer centres in 21 countries worldwide with stage II-III histologically confirmed hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, within 12 months of initial diagnosis. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of random size (4 or 6), stratified by anatomic stage, previous chemotherapy, age, and geographical region, by use of central telephone-based and web-based interactive response technology, to receive either 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with ongoing standard provider or patient-choice adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, with or without concurrent luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist), or endocrine therapy alone, without masking. The primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who started palbociclib or endocrine therapy. This report presents results from the second pre-planned interim analysis triggered on Jan 9, 2020, when 67% of the total number of expected invasive disease-free survival events had been observed. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and EudraCT (2014-005181-30).",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Sept 1, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 5760 patients were randomly assigned to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (n=2883) or endocrine therapy alone (n=2877). At the time of the planned second interim analysis, at a median follow-up of 23·7 months (IQR 16·9-29·2), 170 of 2883 patients assigned to palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 181 of 2877 assigned to endocrine therapy alone had invasive disease-free survival events. 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 88·2% (95% CI 85·2-90·6) for palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 88·5% (85·8-90·7) for endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·76-1·15]; log-rank p=0·51). As the test statistic comparing invasive disease-free survival between groups crossed the prespecified futility boundary, the independent data monitoring committee recommended discontinuation of palbociclib in patients still receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (1742 [61·3%] of 2840 patients on palbociclib and endocrine therapy vs 11 [0·3%] of 2903 on endocrine therapy alone), leucopenia (857 [30·2%] vs three [0·1%]), and fatigue (60 [2·1%] vs ten [0·3%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 351 (12·4%) of 2840 patients on palbociclib plus endocrine therapy versus 220 (7·6%) of 2903 patients on endocrine therapy alone. There were no treatment-related deaths.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "At the planned second interim analysis, addition of 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy did not improve invasive disease-free survival compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone. On the basis of these findings, this regimen cannot be recommended in the adjuvant setting. Long-term follow-up of the PALLAS population and correlative studies are ongoing.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite all the effort taken, there is often surprisingly little attention paid to the hormone analyses involved in research studies. Thinking carefully about the quality of the hormone measurements in these studies is, however, of major importance, as this attention to methods may prevent false conclusions and inappropriate follow-up studies. We discuss issues regarding hormone measurements that one should consider, ideally prior to starting, or otherwise, as they arise during a scientific study: quality of the technique, expertise, matrices, timing and storage conditions, freeze-thaw cycles, lot-to-lot and day-to-day variation, analyses per batch or sample-wise, singlicate or duplicate measurements, combining methods, and standardization. This article and the examples mentioned herein aim to clarify the need to pay attention to the hormone analyses, and to help in making decisions. In addition, these examples help editors and reviewers of scientific journals to pay attention to the methods section in the submitted manuscripts and ask the right critical questions when needed.",

Scarcer yet are outcomes data in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the setting of newer mastectomy techniques, such as skin-sparing mastectomies (SSM) and nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM).",
        "Methods": "Data were extracted from the medical records of BRCA1/2 carriers who were diagnosed with BC and treated at a single institution between 2006 and 2020. The data extracted included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, disease stage, surgical treatment, use of radiation therapy (RT), and disease outcome.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, 255 BC patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutations were identified. Of these, 128 (50.2%) underwent a mastectomy (SSM or NSM in 82% of them), 76 (59.4%) without postmastectomy RT (non-PMRT) and 52 (40.6%) with PMRT, whereas 127 (49.8%) elected for breast-conserving treatment (BCT). The non-PMRT group had earlier disease stages (82.3% were Tis and T1N0) compared with the PMRT and BCT groups (3.6% and 48.1%, respectively; P < .05). The IBTR cumulative rate was 9 of 76 (11.8%) in the non-PMRT cohort compared with 0 of 52 in the PMRT group (P = .01) and 6 of 127 (4.7%) in the BCT group (P = .06). The cumulative incidences of IBTR at 5 and 10 years were 9.8% and 27.4%, respectively, in the non-PMRT group versus 2% and 11.3%, respectively, in the BCT group (P = .0183). No significant difference in overall survival was observed at the time of follow-up.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "BRCA1/2 mutation carriers treated with mastectomy without PMRT had higher rates of IBTR than those who underwent mastectomy and PMRT or BCT, despite earlier stages of disease. The safety of SSM/NSM should be evaluated in a prospective trial.",

This study's objectives were to (1) describe the trends in the rates of unilateral and bilateral mastectomy (BM) in women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer (UBC) in Ontario, Canada from 1991 to 2013, and (2) identify factors associated with BM to treat UBC.",
        "Methods": "This retrospective cohort analysis included all women aged 18 and older diagnosed with UBC between January 1991 and December 2013. Health administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, the Ontario Cancer Registry, and the Discharge Abstract Database were used to identify all breast cancer and mastectomy cases. Age-adjusted mastectomy rates were plotted over time. Univariable and multivariable analyses included clinically significant covariates.",
        "Results/Findings": "From 1991 to 2013 there were 172,165 cases of UBC and 64,886 mastectomies (37.7%) performed in Ontario. 13.6% of the mastectomies were bilateral. BM rates increased over sixfold (from 4 to 25%) across all age groups under age 70 over a 23-year period. On multivariable analysis, younger age, higher income, rural community, earlier breast cancer stage, lobular histology, availability of reconstruction and teaching hospitals were associated with increased odds of BM.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This is the largest population study of breast cancer patients in Canada and shows an increasing rate of BM for UBC. The results are similar to those already described in the US and highlight the importance of continued efforts to promote efficient communication and evidence-based decision-making prior to breast surgery.",

        "Methods": "This meta-analysis was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2019 for studies comparing the diagnostic performance of ABB-MRI and FDP-MRI in the breast. Studies were reviewed by two authors independently according to eligibility and exclusion criteria and split into two subgroups (screening population studies and studies using cohorts enriched with known cancers) to avoid bias. Quality assessment and bias for diagnostic accuracy was determined with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The diagnostic accuracy for each subgroup was pooled using a bivariate random effects model and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves produced. Sensitivities and specificities were compared using a paired t-test.",
        "Results/Findings": "Five screening (62/2,588 cancers/patients) and eight enriched cohort (540/1,432 cancers/patients) studies were included in the meta-analysis. QUADAS-2 assessment showed a low risk of bias in most studies. The pooled sensitivity/specificity/area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for screening studies was 0.90/0.92/0.94 for ABB-MRI and 0.92/0.95/0.97 for FDP-MRI. The pooled sensitivity/specificity/AUC for enriched cohort studies was 0.93/0.83/0.94 for ABB-MRI and 0.93/0.84/0.95 for FDP-MRI.

However, these studies were performed in countries with unequal access to healthcare. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether SES also contributes to the likelihood of receiving IBR in a country with equal access to healthcare.",
        "Methods": "Patients with stage I or II breast cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2018 who underwent mastectomy were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. SES was calculated from the average incomes of each postal code which were divided into 10-deciles. Primary outcome was the effect of SES on the likelihood of receiving IBR, controlled for patient, tumour and hospital characteristics expressed as Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).",
        "Results/Findings": "Higher SES significantly increased the probability of undergoing postmastectomy IBR (OR 1.05 per 10% SES stratum), just as larger hospital volume (average volume OR 1.89 and large volume 2.58), oestrogen positive tumours (OR 1.19) and neo-adjuvant therapy (OR 1.42). In contrast, factors significantly reducing the likelihood of receiving IBR were older age (OR 0.92 per year), stage II (OR 0.61 compared to stage I) and adjuvant therapy (OR 0.56).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Women with lower SES undergoing mastectomy were less likely to receive postmastectomy IBR. More research is warranted to study whether lifestyle factors associated with lower SES such as smoking and higher BMI, language barrier, illiteracy and less access to internet explain these differences.",

Of the 333 eligible patients, 165 were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 168 to placebo plus chemotherapy. At data cutoff (April 3, 2020), median follow-up was 20·6 months (IQR 8·7-24·9) in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 19·8 months (8·1-24·5) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. Pathological complete response was documented in 95 (58%, 95% CI 50-65) patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 69 (41%, 34-49) patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (rate difference 17%, 95% CI 6-27; one-sided p=0·0044 [significance boundary 0·0184]). In the PD-L1-positive population, pathological complete response was documented in 53 (69%, 95% CI 57-79) of 77 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 37 (49%, 38-61) of 75 patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (rate difference 20%, 95% CI 4-35; one-sided p=0·021 [significance boundary 0·0184]). In the neoadjuvant phase, grade 3-4 adverse events were balanced and treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 37 (23%) and 26 (16%) patients, with one patient per group experiencing an unrelated grade 5 adverse event (traffic accident in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and pneumonia in the placebo plus chemotherapy group).",

        "Methods": "The analyses were conducted into three different groups of early breast cancer patients to evaluate the survival benefit needed to make treatment worthwhile before starting HT (A), after a few months from the beginning (B) and after several years of HT (C). The questionnaires, showing hypothetical scenarios based on potential survival times and rates without HT, were used to determine the lowest gains women judged necessary to make the treatment worthwhile.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 452 patients were included in the study: 149 in group A, 150 in group B and 153 in group C. In group C, 65% of patients were receiving HT with aromatase inhibitors (with or without a LHRH analogue). In the groups A, B, C 8%, 20% and 26%, respectively, received adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 355 women (79%) had children. The responses were quite similar between the three groups. A median gain of 10 years was judged necessary to make adjuvant HT worthwhile based on the hypothetical scenario of untreated mean survival time of 5 and 15 years. Median gain of 20% more women surviving was judged necessary to make adjuvant HT worthwhile based on an untreated 5-year survival rate expectation of 60%. Cognitive dysfunction was considered the side effect least compatible with the continuation of treatment in all three groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This is a large study of patient preferences on HT. Compared with other studies with similar design, the patients included in the present study required larger benefits to make adjuvant therapy worthwhile.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aim of this review is to evaluate associations between possible late effects of cancer treatment (i.e. physical complaints, fatigue, or cognitive complaints) and work ability among workers beyond 2 years after cancer diagnosis who returned to work. The role of job resources (social support, autonomy, leadership style, coaching, and organizational culture) is also evaluated.",
        "Methods": "The search for studies was conducted in PsycINFO, Medline, Business Source Premier, ABI/Inform, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. A quality assessment was used to clarify the quality across studies.",
        "Results/Findings": "The searches included 2303 records. Finally, 36 studies were included. Work ability seemed to decline shortly after cancer treatment and recover in the first 2 years after diagnosis, although it might still be lower than among healthy workers. No data were available on the course of work ability beyond the first 2 years. Late physical complaints, fatigue and cognitive complaints were negatively related with work ability across all relevant studies. Furthermore, social support and autonomy were associated with higher work ability, but no data were available on a possible buffering effect of these job resources on the relationship between late effects and work ability. As far as reported, most research was carried out among salaried workers.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "It is unknown if late effects of cancer treatment diminish work ability beyond two years after being diagnosed with cancer. Therefore, more longitudinal research into the associations between possible late effects of cancer treatment and work ability needs to be carried out. Moreover, research is needed on the buffering effect of job resources, both for salaried and self-employed workers.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer has distinct causes, prognoses, and outcomes and effects in patients at premenopausal and postmenopausal ages. We sought to assess the global burden and trends in breast cancer by menopausal status.",
        "Methods": "We did a population-based analysis of global breast cancer incidence and mortality among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Menopausal status was defined using age as a proxy, whereby breast cancer cases or deaths at age 50 years or older were regarded as postmenopausal. Age-standardised breast cancer incidence and mortality in 2018 were calculated using GLOBOCAN data. Incidence trends for 1998-2012 were assessed in 44 populations from 41 countries using the Cancer in Five Continents plus database, by calculating the annual average percent change.",
        "Results/Findings": "Approximately 645 000 premenopausal and 1·4 million postmenopausal breast cancer cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2018, with more than 130 000 and 490 000 deaths occurring in each menopausal group, respectively. Proportionally, countries with a low UNDP human development index (HDI) faced a greater burden of premenopausal breast cancer for both new cases and deaths compared with higher income countries. Countries with a very high HDI had the highest premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer incidence (30·6 and 253·6 cases per 100 000, respectively), whereas countries with low and medium HDI had the highest premenopausal and postmenopausal mortality, respectively (8·5 and 53·3 deaths per 100 000, respectively). When examining breast cancer trends, we noted significantly increasing age-standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) for premenopausal breast cancer in 20 of 44 populations and significantly increasing ASIRs for postmenopausal breast cancer in 24 of 44 populations. The growth exclusively at premenopausal ages largely occurred in high-income countries, whereas the increasing postmenopausal breast cancer burden was most notable in countries under transition.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We provide evidence of a rising burden of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer worldwide. Although early diagnosis and access to treatment remain crucial in low-income and middle-income countries, primary prevention efforts seeking to decrease exposure to known breast cancer risk factors are warranted in all world regions to curb the future breast cancer burden.",

The FAST Trial (CRUKE/04/015) evaluated normal tissue effects (NTE) and disease outcomes after 5-fr regimens. Ten-year results are presented.",
        "Methods": "Women ≥ 50 years of age with low-risk invasive breast carcinoma (pT1-2 pN0) were randomly assigned to 50 Gy/25 fr (5 weeks) or 30 or 28.5 Gy in 5 once-weekly fr of 6.0 or 5.7 Gy. The primary end point was change in photographic breast appearance at 2 and 5 years; secondary end points were physician assessments of NTE and local tumor control. Odds ratios (ORs) from longitudinal analyses compared regimens.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 915 women were recruited from 18 UK centers (2004-2007). Five-year photographs were available for 615/862 (71%) eligible patients. ORs for change in photographic breast appearance were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.49;   = .019) for 30 Gy and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.71;   = .686) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. α/β estimate for photographic end point was 2.7 Gy (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.9 Gy), giving a 5-fr schedule of 28 Gy (95% CI, 26 to 30 Gy) estimated to be isoeffective with 50 Gy/25 fr. ORs for any moderate/marked physician-assessed breast NTE (shrinkage, induration, telangiectasia, edema) were 2.12 (95% CI, 1.55 to 2.89;   < .001) for 30 Gy and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.72;   = .248) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. With 9.9 years median follow-up, 11 ipsilateral breast cancer events (50 Gy: 3; 30 Gy: 4; 28.5 Gy: 4) and 96 deaths (50 Gy: 30; 30 Gy: 33; 28.5 Gy: 33) have occurred.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "At 10 years, there was no significant difference in NTE rates after 28.5 Gy/5 fr compared with 50 Gy/25 fr, but NTE were higher after 30 Gy/5 fr. Results confirm the published 3-year findings that a once-weekly 5-fr schedule of whole-breast radiotherapy can be identified that appears to be radiobiologically comparable for NTE to a conventionally fractionated regimen.",

The recently published results on the improvement of the overall survival of pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy, while preserving, and in some items improving their QoL, will change the landscape of the management of this patient population. Their extended survival and potential improvement in QoL will, therefore, modify their specific needs in terms of psychosocial support. The complexity of the care of young women with MBC is described herein, based on an extensive literature review. Further research about the specific psychosocial requirements of these women and a new multidisciplinary holistic approach is paramount to properly address their concerns and preferences. The communication with and support of their partners, parents and children is an important factor affecting the QoL of these patients. Altogether, a multidisciplinary care, open communication and personalized support is required to address the psychosocial implications of the new prognostic expectations on these patients with the incorporation of new targeted therapies.",

        "Methods": "This was a prospective observational cohort study that included 136 patients with breast cancer below 40 years who received GnRHa during chemotherapy for fertility preservation. Plasma anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were measured before chemotherapy (baseline) and after chemotherapy. Subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the interval between the start of GnRHa and the start of chemotherapy for analysis: 1-6 days, 7-13 days, and ≥ 14 days. The ratio of the post-chemotherapy AMH value to the baseline AMH (pcAMH) at each time point were compared among the 3 groups. Ranked analysis of covariance was used for statistical analysis, adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and the existence of polycystic ovaries (PCOs). In addition, recovery of ovarian function (AMH ≥ 1 ng/mL) at 12 months was evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median age of the patients was 32 years. There was no difference in the baseline AMH levels among the 3 groups (mean ± standard error: 5.0 ± 0.4 ng/mL [1-6 days], 5.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL [7-13 days], and 8.1 ± 1.3 ng/mL [≥ 14 days];   = 0.250). The pcAMH at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were not significantly different among the 3 groups ( -values were 0.332, 0.732, 0.830, 0.148, and 0.393, respectively). In multivariate analysis, young age (  = 0.024), low BMI (  = 0.013), and the existence of PCO (  = 0.015) were predictors for AMH ≥ 1 ng/mL at 12 months.",

Here, we present 5-year results of the FAST-Forward trial.",
        "Methods": "FAST-Forward is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial done at 97 hospitals (47 radiotherapy centres and 50 referring hospitals) in the UK. Patients aged at least 18 years with invasive carcinoma of the breast (pT1-3, pN0-1, M0) after breast conservation surgery or mastectomy were eligible. We randomly allocated patients to either 40 Gy in 15 fractions (over 3 weeks), 27 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week), or 26 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week) to the whole breast or chest wall. Allocation was not masked because of the nature of the intervention. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour relapse; assuming a 2% 5-year incidence for 40 Gy, non-inferiority was predefined as ≤1·6% excess for five-fraction schedules (critical hazard ratio [HR] of 1·81). Normal tissue effects were assessed by clinicians, patients, and from photographs. This trial is registered at isrctn.com, ISRCTN19906132.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Nov 24, 2011, and June 19, 2014, we recruited and obtained consent from 4096 patients from 97 UK centres, of whom 1361 were assigned to the 40 Gy schedule, 1367 to the 27 Gy schedule, and 1368 to the 26 Gy schedule. At a median follow-up of 71·5 months (IQR 71·3 to 71·7), the primary endpoint event occurred in 79 patients (31 in the 40 Gy group, 27 in the 27 Gy group, and 21 in the 26 Gy group); HRs versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 0·86 (95% CI 0·51 to 1·44) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 0·67 (0·38 to 1·16) for 26 Gy in five fractions. 5-year incidence of ipsilateral breast tumour relapse after 40 Gy was 2·1% (1·4 to 3·1); estimated absolute differences versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were -0·3% (-1·0 to 0·9) for 27 Gy in five fractions (probability of incorrectly accepting an inferior five-fraction schedule: p=0·0022 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions) and -0·7% (-1·3 to 0·3) for 26 Gy in five fractions (p=0·00019 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions). At 5 years, any moderate or marked clinician-assessed normal tissue effects in the breast or chest wall was reported for 98 of 986 (9·9%) 40 Gy patients, 155 (15·4%) of 1005 27 Gy patients, and 121 of 1020 (11·9%) 26 Gy patients. Across all clinician assessments from 1-5 years, odds ratios versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 1·55 (95% CI 1·32 to 1·83, p<0·0001) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 1·12 (0·94 to 1·34, p=0·20) for 26 Gy in five fractions. Patient and photographic assessments showed higher normal tissue effect risk for 27 Gy versus 40 Gy but not for 26 Gy versus 40 Gy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "26 Gy in five fractions over 1 week is non-inferior to the standard of 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for local tumour control, and is as safe in terms of normal tissue effects up to 5 years for patients prescribed adjuvant local radiotherapy after primary surgery for early-stage breast cancer.",

In our case report, a 28-year-old nulligravid Caucasian woman diagnosed with breast cancer underwent controlled ovarian stimulation-oocyte cryopreservation before chemotherapy. The oocyte retrieval was performed without complications and the woman was discharged after five hours. Three days later, the patient self-injected depot-GnRHa as chemoprotective agent, as indicated by the oncologist. The next day, the patient referred to the emergency room and she was diagnosed with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and required inpatient care. As a consequence, the start of the chemotherapy was delayed by two weeks. In conclusion, chemoprotection with depot-GnRHa after oocyte/embryo cryopreservation is not exempt from risks. The timing for depot-GnRHa administration should be established by the agreement between oncologist and gynecologist in order to avoid the risk of OHSS.",

        "Results/Findings": "213 patients were available for QoL analysis. There was a significant decrease in TOI scores for both treatment groups at 3 and 6 months that returned to pre-treatment levels at 12 months, then continued to increase reflecting improved QoL. By 3 months there was a significant difference from baseline in both groups for menopausal symptoms, and between groups in the proportion experiencing hot flushes at any time. The C + G group experienced higher levels of vasomotor symptoms generally during the treatment phase; by 24 months, the short-term negative effect of goserelin was reversed, with hot flushes twice as frequent in the chemotherapy only group (40.9% vs 21.3%).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has received increasing attention in Western countries and is especially common among breast cancer (BC) patients. So far, its effectiveness has not been well studied, which is in part due to the contextuality of CAM along with a lack of information of why patients use it.",
        "Methods": "Young BC patients constitute a special patient group regarding clinical characteristics, QOL, and their role in society. Since little is known about their CAM use, this study aimed at exploring it as well as their reasons for CAM use.",
        "Results/Findings": "Data on CAM and sociodemographics were collected via questionnaire in the context of a rehabilitation program for young mothers with BC. Initial BC diagnoses were between 2009 and 2014 (recruitment period 2012-2015). Clinical characteristics were derived from the patient files. Descriptive statistics were used to describe frequencies and statistically significant differences were tested.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among the 827 patients, with an average age of 39.6 years, 62.5% had used CAM with regard to their cancer. CAM use was significantly higher in women with higher educational level, higher employment status, and statutory health insurance, respectively. The average monthly expenses on CAM were EUR 50. Every 5th woman used CAM without her physician's knowledge. The types most often used were dietary supplements with vitamins or minerals. The most frequent reasons for CAM use were to strengthen the immune system, support conventional medicine, and combat side effects.",

        "Methods": "In this non-inferior randomized phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 308 chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically confirmed TNBC after primary surgery to receive either six cycles of TP (docetaxel: 75 mg/m  or paclitaxel 175 mg/m  d1; carboplatin AUC = 5, day 1), or four cycles of EC (epirubicin: 90 mg/m ; cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m , day 1) followed by four cycles of T (docetaxel: 75 mg/m  or paclitaxel 175 mg/m , day 1). The primary end point was the disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 5 years. Both regimens were repeated every 3 weeks. The prognostic and predictive value of germline breast cancer gene mutations and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression was evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 66.9 months, the 5-year DFS rate was 85.8% in the EC-T arm, and 84.4% in the TP arm (p non-inferiority = 0.034, p log-rank = 0.712). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 94.4% in the EC-T arm and 93.5% in the TP arm (p = 0.770). Patients in the TP arm showed better compliance and experienced significantly lower frequencies of G3/4 neutrocytopenia and G3/4 alopecia, but higher rates of G1-4 thrombocytopenia than those in the EC-T arm. Patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors showed significantly improved DFS and OS.",

        "Methods": "In October 2018, the BHGI convened the Sixth Global Summit on Improving Breast Healthcare Through Resource-Stratified Phased Implementation. The purpose of the summit was to define a stepwise methodology (phased implementation) for guiding the translation of resource-appropriate breast cancer control guidelines into real-world practice. Three expert consensus panels developed stepwise, resource-appropriate recommendations for implementing these guidelines in low-income and middle-income countries as well as underserved communities in high-income countries. Each panel focused on 1 of 3 specific aspects of breast cancer care: 1) early detection, 2) treatment, and 3) health system strengthening.",
        "Results/Findings": "Key findings from the summit and subsequent article preparation included the identification of phased-implementation prerequisites that were explored during consensus debates. These core issues and concepts are key components for implementing breast health care that consider real-world resource constraints. Communication and engagement across all levels of care is vital to any effectively operating health care system, including effective communication with ministries of health and of finance, to demonstrate needs, outcomes, and cost benefits.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Underserved communities at all economic levels require effective strategies to deploy scarce resources to ensure access to timely, effective, and affordable health care. Systematically strategic approaches translating guidelines into practice are needed to build health system capacity to meet the current and anticipated global breast cancer burden.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with rapidly increasing incidence rates reported in Uganda and Zimbabwe. However, the magnitude of these rising trends in premenopausal and postmenopausal women is unknown in most African countries. We used data from the African Cancer Registry Network on incident breast cancers in women from 11 population-based cancer registries in 10 countries representing each of the four SSA regions. We explored incidence changes among women before and after age 50 by calendar period and, where possible, generational effects in this unique sub-Saharan African cohort. Temporal trends revealed increasing incidence rates in all registries during the study period, except in Nairobi where rates stabilised during 2010 to 2014 after rapidly increasing from 2003 to 2010 (APC = 8.5 95%, CI: 3.0-14.2). The cumulative risk varied between and within regions, with the highest risks observed in Nairobi-Kenya, Mauritius and the Seychelles. There were similar or more rapidly increasing incidence rates in women aged 50+ compared to women <50 years in all registries except The Gambia. Birth cohort analyses revealed increases in the incidence rates in successive generations of women aged 45 and over in Harare-Zimbabwe and Kampala-Uganda. In conclusion, the incidence of BC is increasing rapidly in many parts of Africa; however, the magnitude of these changes differs. These results highlight the need for urgent actions across the cancer continuum from in-depth risk factor studies to provision of adequate therapy as well as the necessity of supporting the maintenance of good quality population-based cancer registration in Africa.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Transgender (TG) individuals have higher rates of mortality associated with cancer diagnoses, in part due to avoidance of gender-assigned cancer screenings resulting in later stages at diagnosis. Knowledge about the risks of breast or gynecological cancer in TG and nonbinary (NB) persons receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy is limited. Even less information exists regarding the subset of individuals with genetic predisposition for these malignancies. We performed a retrospective literature review of studies from the last 15 years on breast cancer rates and identified risks in TG persons. An accumulating body of data on breast cancer incidence in TG persons suggests higher than previously believed rates of breast cancer in TG women compared with cisgender men and risk correlating with duration of hormone use. Few studies have examined other cancer risks in TG populations. To date, only three publications address the association with BRCA1/2 mutation presence and breast cancer incidence in TG persons. Meanwhile, there is growing awareness and social acceptance of TG/NB identities coupled with recognition of gender dysphoria at increasingly earlier ages. No information directly addressing cancer risk counseling in TG/NB adolescents and young adults with a family history of cancer or hereditary cancer syndrome exists. Whether the presence of a known genetic predisposition or strong family cancer history may affect cancer risk in these populations is unknown, leading to significant gaps in clinicians' ability to accurately and appropriately estimate cancer risks and counsel those with genetic predisposition on the risks/benefits associated with surgical options and the initiation, duration, and dosing of gender-affirming hormone therapies. A series of three cases illustrates the utility of cancer risk assessment and genetic testing in TG/NB adolescents and young adults, and the unique challenges and unanswered questions that are encountered in the process.",

        "Methods": "Partners of young BCS (3-8 years post treatment and ≤ 45 years old at diagnosis) and partners of age-matched healthy acquaintance controls completed questionnaires on overall, physical (physical function, sexual difficulty), social (personal resources, sexual enjoyment, marital satisfaction, partner social support, social constraints, parenting satisfaction), psychological (depressive symptoms), and spiritual (behaviors, beliefs, and activities) QoL. Analyses included descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA to compare partner groups on all study variables.",
        "Results/Findings": "Although partners of young BCS (n = 227) reported fewer social constraints (p < .001), they reported lower overall QoL (p < .001), fewer personal resources (p < .001), more sexual difficulty (p = .019), less sexual enjoyment (p = .002), less marital satisfaction (p = .019), more depressive symptoms (p = .024), and fewer spiritual behaviors (p < .001), beliefs (p = .001) and activities (p = .003) compared to partners of healthy acquaintance controls (n = 170).

        "Background/Purpose": "Whether radiation therapy (RT) affects contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk in women with pathogenic germline variants in moderate- to high-penetrance breast cancer-associated genes is unknown. In a population-based case-control study, we examined the association between RT; variants in ATM, BRCA1/2, or CHEK2*1100delC; and CBC risk. We analyzed 708 cases of women with CBC and 1399 controls with unilateral breast cancer, all diagnosed with first invasive breast cancer between 1985 and 2000 and aged younger than 55 years at diagnosis and screened for variants in breast cancer-associated genes. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable conditional logistic regression. RT did not modify the association between known pathogenic variants and CBC risk (eg, BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers without RT: RR = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.76 to 7.01; BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers with RT: RR = 4.46, 95% CI = 2.96 to 6.71), suggesting that modifying RT plans for young women with breast cancer is unwarranted. Rare ATM missense variants, not currently identified as pathogenic, were associated with increased risk of RT-associated CBC (carriers of ATM rare missense variants of uncertain significance without RT: RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.09 to 1.55; carriers of ATM rare missense variants of uncertain significance with RT: RR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.31 to 6.80).

Patient-reported perceived preoperative information (odds ratio (OR) 12·73, 95 per cent c.i. 6·03 to 26·89) and the feeling of being involved in the decision-making process (OR 2·56, 1·14 to 5·76) remained strong independent predictors of IBR despite adjustment for socioeconomic factors. Importantly, responders to the survey represented a relatively young and wealthy population with a lower tumour burden.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Several socioeconomic factors independently influence IBR rates; however, patient-reported information and involvement in the surgical decision-making process remain independent predictors for the likelihood of having IBR.",

Previous reports lacked detailed clinical data or health-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and did not prospectively assess the combined impact of treatment and related sequelae on employment.",
        "Methods": "We used a French prospective clinical cohort of patients with stage I-III breast cancer including 1,874 women who were working and ≥ 5 years younger than legal retirement age (≤ 57 years) at breast cancer diagnosis. Our outcome was nonreturn to work (non-RTW) 2 years after diagnosis. Independent variables included treatment characteristics as well as toxicities (Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4) and PROs (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality of life Questionnaires, Breast cancer module [QLQ-BR23] and Fatigue module [QLQ-FA12], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) collected 1 year after diagnosis. Logistic regression models assessed correlates of non-RTW, adjusting for age, stage, comorbidities, and socioeconomic covariates.",
        "Results/Findings": "Two years after diagnosis, 21% of patients had not returned to work. Odds of non-RTW were significantly increased among patients treated with combinations of chemotherapy and trastuzumab (odds ratio [OR]   chemotherapy-hormonotherapy: for chemotherapy-trastuzumab, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.44; for chemotherapy-trastuzumab-hormonotherapy, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.41). Other significant associations with non-RTW included grade ≥ 3 CTCAE toxicities (OR   no, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.18), arm morbidity (OR   no, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.13), anxiety (OR   no, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.11), and depression (OR   no, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.91).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Receipt of systemic therapy combinations including trastuzumab was associated with increased odds of non-RTW. Likelihood of unemployment was also higher among patients who reported severe physical and psychological symptoms. This comprehensive study identifies potentially vulnerable patients and warrants supportive interventional strategies to facilitate their RTW.",

Recent publications demonstrate negative psychosocial well-being in these offspring. We prospectively assessed for psychological distress and unmet needs in offspring of BC patients.",
        "Methods": "Eligible offspring aged 14 to 24 years were consented and completed the Kessler-10 Questionnaire and Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument. Demographic and BC details were obtained.",
        "Results/Findings": "Over a 7-month period, 120 offspring from 74 BC patients were included. Fifty-nine mothers had nonmetastatic BC (nMBC), and 27 had metastatic BC (MBC) with median time from diagnosis of 27.6 and 36.1 months, respectively. The prevalence of high/very high distress was 31%, with significantly higher scores reported by female offspring (P = .017). Unmet needs were reported by more than 50% of offspring with the majority of needs relating to information about their mother's cancer. Greater unmet needs were seen in female offspring and offspring with none or one sibling for several domains (practical assistance, time-out, dealing with feelings, and support from friends; P < .05). Greater unmet needs were seen in regard to feelings for MBC patients' offspring compared with nMBC but were similar for other unmet needs.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our study confirms high levels of psychological distress in offspring of BC patients, with female offspring reporting significantly higher emotional distress and unmet needs.

We previously reported the magnitude of absolute improvements in freedom from any recurrence across a continuous, composite measure of recurrence risk to tailor decision making. With longer follow-up, we now focus on distant recurrence.",
        "Methods": "The TEXT/SOFT HR-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative analysis population included 4,891 women stratified by predetermined chemotherapy use. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 8-year freedom from distant recurrence were analyzed using subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP) methodology across subpopulations defined by the continuous composite measure of recurrence risk. For each patient, the composite risk value was obtained from a Cox model that incorporated age; nodal status; tumor size; grade; and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 labeling index expression levels.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall rate of 8-year freedom from distant recurrence was 91.1% and ranged from approximately 100% to 63% across lowest to highest composite risks. TEXT patients who received chemotherapy had an average absolute improvement with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS of 5.1%, and STEPP analysis showed improvements from less than 1% to more than 15% from lowest to highest composite risks. SOFT patients who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy had an average 5.2% absolute improvement with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen and reached 10% across composite risks; for tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen, the maximum improvement was approximately 3.5%. Women who did not receive chemotherapy had a more than 97% rate of 8-year freedom from distant recurrence, and improvements with exemestane plus OFS ranged from 1% to 4%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Premenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and high recurrence risk, as defined by clinicopathologic characteristics, may experience a 10% to 15% absolute improvement in 8-year freedom from distant recurrence with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone.

        "Background/Purpose": "This article is the American Cancer Society's biennial update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Over the most recent 5-year period (2012-2016), the breast cancer incidence rate increased slightly by 0.3% per year, largely because of rising rates of local stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, the breast cancer death rate continues to decline, dropping 40% from 1989 to 2017 and translating to 375,900 breast cancer deaths averted. Notably, the pace of the decline has slowed from an annual decrease of 1.9% during 1998 through 2011 to 1.3% during 2011 through 2017, largely driven by the trend in white women. Consequently, the black-white disparity in breast cancer mortality has remained stable since 2011 after widening over the past 3 decades. Nevertheless, the death rate remains 40% higher in blacks (28.4 vs 20.3 deaths per 100,000) despite a lower incidence rate (126.7 vs 130.8); this disparity is magnified among black women aged <50 years, who have a death rate double that of whites. In the most recent 5-year period (2013-2017), the death rate declined in Hispanics (2.1% per year), blacks (1.5%), whites (1.0%), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.8%) but was stable in American Indians/Alaska Natives. However, by state, breast cancer mortality rates are no longer declining in Nebraska overall; in Colorado and Wisconsin in black women; and in Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia in white women. Breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in women (surpassing lung cancer) in four Southern and two Midwestern states among blacks and in Utah among whites during 2016-2017. Declines in breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment services to all women.",

We identified 67 premenopausal, high-risk women age 35-45, without surgical prophylaxis, who did not initiate tamoxifen. Factors associated with noninitiation were examined. About 37% of patients had no documented provider-based discussion regarding initiation. Type of high-risk diagnosis was the only factor associated with a provider-based discussion (P = .03). For patients offered tamoxifen, primary reasons for noninitiation were perceived minimal benefit (66.7%), fertility concerns (16.7%), and concerns about side effects (7.1%). Implementation of comprehensive educational strategies regarding the benefits of tamoxifen should be facilitated to improve initiation among young high-risk patients.",

        "Methods": "We enrolled 1,483 premenopausal women (age ≤ 45 years) with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with definitive surgery after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ovarian function was assessed every 6 months for 2 years since enrollment on the basis of follicular-stimulating hormone levels and vaginal bleeding history. If ovarian function was confirmed to be premenopausal at each visit, the patient was randomly assigned to complete 5 years of TAM alone (TAM-only) group or 5 years of TAM with OFS for 2 years that involved monthly goserelin administration (TAM + OFS) group. DFS was defined from the time of enrollment to the time of the first event.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1,293 patients were randomly assigned, and 1,282 patients were eligible for analysis. The estimated 5-year DFS rate was 91.1% in the TAM + OFS group and 87.5% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97;   = .033). The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 99.4% in the TAM + OFS group and 97.8% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.94;   = .029).",

Fifty-four percent of women wished future children before diagnosis; of these, 71% still desired biologic children afterwards. In multivariable analysis, not having children was the only patient characteristic significantly associated with fertility concerns at diagnosis. Twenty-seven percent used fertility preservation strategies. Women who received chemotherapy reported greater physical (p = 0.021) and sexual difficulties (p = 0.039) than women who did not. Women who were married or had a partner reported less psychosocial problems than single women (p = 0.039).",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aim of this review was to analyze the respective efficacy of various heart-sparing radiotherapy techniques.",
        "Methods": "Heart-sparing can be performed in three different ways in breast cancer radiotherapy: by seeking to keep the heart out of treated volumes (i.e. by prone position or specific breathing techniques such as deep inspiration breath-hold [DIBH] and/or gating), by solely irradiating a small volume around the lumpectomy cavity (partial breast irradiation, PBI), or by using modern radiation techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or protons. This overview presents the available data on these three approaches.",
        "Results/Findings": "Studies on prone position are heterogeneous and most trials only refer to patients with large breasts; therefore, no definitive conclusion can be drawn for clinical routine. Nonetheless, there seems to be a trend toward better sparing of the left anterior descending artery in supine position even for these selected patients. The data on the use of DIBH for heart-sparing in breast cancer patients is consistent and the benefit compared to free-breathing is supported by several studies. In comparison with whole breast irradiation (WBI), PBI has an advantage in reducing the heart dose. Of note, DIBH and PBI with multicatheter brachytherapy are similar with regard to the dose reduction to heart structures. WBI by IMRT/VMAT techniques without DIBH is not an effective strategy for heart-sparing in breast cancer patients with \"standard\" anatomy. A combination of DIBH and IMRT may be used for internal mammary radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Based on the available findings, the DEGRO breast cancer expert panel recommends the use of DIBH as the best heart-sparing technique. Nonetheless, depending on the treatment volume and localization, other techniques may be employed or combined with DIBH when appropriate.",

Other social determinants of health include medical distrust, immigration, status, inadequate housing, food insecurity, and geographic factors such as neighborhood access to health services. Socioeconomic factors influence risk of breast cancer. For all racial/ethnic groups, breast cancer incidence rates tend to be positively associated with socioeconomic status. On the other hand, low socioeconomic status is associated with increased risk of aggressive premenopausal breast cancers as well as late stage of diagnosis and poorer survival. There are well-documented disparities in breast cancer survival by socioeconomic status, race, education, census-tract-level poverty, and access to health insurance and preventive care. Poverty is associated with other factors related to late stage at breast cancer diagnosis and poorer survival such as inadequate health insurance, lack of a primary care physician and poor access to health care.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer may be guided by clinicopathological factors and a score based on a 21-gene assay to determine the risk of recurrence. Whether the level of clinical risk of breast cancer recurrence adds prognostic information to the recurrence score is not known.",
        "Methods": "We performed a prospective trial involving 9427 women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer, in whom an assay of 21 genes had been performed, and we classified the clinical risk of recurrence of breast cancer as low or high on the basis of the tumor size and histologic grade. The effect of clinical risk was evaluated by calculating hazard ratios for distant recurrence with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. The initial endocrine therapy was tamoxifen alone in the majority of the premenopausal women who were 50 years of age or younger.",
        "Results/Findings": "The level of clinical risk was prognostic of distant recurrence in women with an intermediate 21-gene recurrence score of 11 to 25 (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis or a greater potential benefit from chemotherapy) who were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy (hazard ratio for the comparison of high vs. low clinical risk, 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93 to 3.87) or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.48) and in women with a high recurrence score (a score of 26 to 100), all of whom were assigned to chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.19). Among women who were 50 years of age or younger who had received endocrine therapy alone, the estimated (±SE) rate of distant recurrence at 9 years was less than 5% (≤1.8±0.9%) with a low recurrence score (a score of 0 to 10), irrespective of clinical risk, and 4.7±1.0% with an intermediate recurrence score and low clinical risk. In this age group, the estimated distant recurrence at 9 years exceeded 10% among women with a high clinical risk and an intermediate recurrence score who received endocrine therapy alone (12.3±2.4%) and among those with a high recurrence score who received chemoendocrine therapy (15.2±3.3%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Clinical-risk stratification provided prognostic information that, when added to the 21-gene recurrence score, could be used to identify premenopausal women who could benefit from more effective therapy.

        "Background/Purpose": "Little is known about how a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment affects job-related outcomes in young women with breast cancer, who are an integral part of the workforce. We sought to describe employment trends among young breast cancer survivors.",
        "Methods": "911 women with non-metastatic breast cancer were surveyed about employment-related outcomes 1 year post-diagnosis. Participants were enrolled in the Young Women's Breast Cancer Study an ongoing, multi-center cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer at age ≤ 40.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 911 women, median age at diagnosis was 36 years (range 17-40). Most women (80%, n = 729) were employed 1 year post-diagnosis. Among the 7% (n = 62) employed before diagnosis but who reported unemployment at 1 year, approximately half reported they were unemployed for health reasons. Among employed women, 7% said treatment affected their ability to perform their job. Women with stage-three disease (vs. stage 1 disease, odds ratio (OR): 3.73, 95% CI 1.39-9.97) and those who reported having money to pay bills after cutting back or difficulty paying bills at baseline (vs. having enough money for special things, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.32-5.52) at baseline were more likely to have transitioned out of the workforce.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results suggest an impact of disease burden and socioeconomic status on employment in young breast cancer survivors. There is a need to ensure young survivors who leave the workforce following diagnosis are sufficiently supported given the potential adverse psychosocial and financial impacts of unemployment on survivors, their families, communities, and society.",

        "Methods": "As part of a multicenter, prospective cohort of women with a diagnosis of BC at or under the age of 40 years, participants were surveyed 30 months after their diagnosis about adherent behaviors. Among those who reported taking ET, adherence was measured with a 3-item Likert-type scale: Do you ever forget to take your ET? If you feel worse when you take your ET, do you stop taking it? Did you take your ET exactly as directed by your doctor over the last 3 months? Women reporting at least 1 nonadherent behavior were classified as nonadherers. Variables with a P value <.20 were included in a multivariable logistic model.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 384 women, 194 (51%) were classified as nonadherers. Univariate factors that retained significance in the multivariable model included educational level (odds ratio [OR], 0.50 for high vs low; P = .04), level of social support according to the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (OR, 0.98 per 1 point; P = .01), and confidence with the decision regarding ET measured on a 0 to 10 numerical scale (OR, 0.63 for high vs low; P = .04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Findings from this study could help to identify young patients at higher risk for nonadherence.

        "Background/Purpose": "A diagnosis of breast cancer at a young age, defined per guidelines as ≤ 40 years, represents a challenging situation requiring additional attention by the treating physicians including radiation oncologists and surgeons involved in the local treatment of these tumors. The present review aims at providing updated evidence on the state of the art about the available techniques and indications for radiation therapy in patients with early breast cancer, specifically focusing on young women. In addition, future perspectives including the ongoing trials and the potential impact of combined approaches with systemic therapies (such as immunotherapy) are reviewed. Major conclusions from this overview are that young women affected by invasive breast cancer seem to receive the greatest benefit from the boost on the tumor bed. Most young patients affected by ductal carcinoma in situ should receive postoperative whole breast irradiation (WBI). When regional node irradiation is considered, young age should be considered as a high-risk factor. Partial breast irradiation is not suitable for young patients and should be recommended within the context of a clinical trial. Importantly, robust data have already supported the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated-WBI schedules that should now replace standard fractionated-WBI as gold standard for all patients irrespective of their age. Finally, organs-at-risk sparing systems as strategy for prevention of radiation-related long-term toxicities should be strongly considered for these patients. Considering the lack of inclusion of young patients in several published trials as well as in some of the ongoing ones, robust evidence to counsel young breast cancer patients on the optimal radiation therapy approach is still lacking. Further studies and ad hoc subgroup analyses in this specific patient population are strongly warranted.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tamoxifen administered for 5 years at 20 mg/d is effective in breast cancer treatment and prevention, but toxicity has limited its broad use. Biomarker trials showed that 5 mg/d is not inferior to 20 mg/d in decreasing breast cancer proliferation. We hypothesized that a lower dose given for a shorter period could be as effective in preventing recurrence from breast intraepithelial neoplasia but have a lower toxicity than the standard dose.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a multicenter randomized trial of tamoxifen, 5 mg/d or placebo administered for 3 years after surgery in women with hormone-sensitive or unknown breast intraepithelial neoplasia, including atypical ductal hyperplasia and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ. The primary end point was the incidence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.",
        "Results/Findings": "Five hundred women 75 years of age or younger were included. After a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 3.9-6.3 years), there were 14 neoplastic events with tamoxifen and 28 with placebo (11.6   23.9 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.92;   = .02), which resulted in a 5-year number needed to treat of 22 (95% CI, 20 to 27). Tamoxifen decreased contralateral breast events by 75% (three   12 events; hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88;   = .02). Patient-reported outcomes were not different between arms except for a slight increase in frequency of daily hot flashes with tamoxifen (  = .02). There were 12 serious adverse events with tamoxifen and 16 with placebo, including one deep vein thrombosis and one stage I endometrial cancer with tamoxifen and one pulmonary embolism with placebo.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tamoxifen at 5 mg/d for 3 years can halve the recurrence of breast intraepithelial neoplasia with a limited toxicity, which provides a new treatment option in these disorders.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Although it is widely accepted that hormone receptor (HR) status is associated with later post-diagnostic periods, a debate exists as to whether the association is independent of age. The aim of our study was to confirm the impact of HR status on later period breast cancer-specific death (LP-BCSD) and later period non-breast cancer-specific death (LP-non-BCSD) in different age subgroups.",
        "Methods": "Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results databases were utilized to identify 181,108 breast cancer patients with > 5 years survival. The cumulative incidence of LP-BCSD and LP-non-BCSD was calculated using the Gray method. The subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) of variables was estimated via the Fine and Gray proportional hazard regression model. Subgroup analyses for LP-BCSD and LP-non-BCSD were performed according to the HR status.",
        "Results/Findings": "The risk of LP-BCSD was exceeded by that of LP-non-BCSD at > 5 years since the diagnosis, particularly in old women. The competing risk regression model indicated that hormone receptor-positive (HR+) was an independent factor for more LP-BCSD (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.54;   < 0.001). However, stratified analysis indicated that HR+ was only associated with more LP-BCSD in the young women subgroup. Although HR+ was associated with more LP-non-BCSD, the predictive value of HR+ for LP-non-BCSD was eliminated after adjusting for age.",

After an early amendment, all HR-positive tumors underwent recurrence score (RS) testing, with chemotherapy omission recommended in RS less than or equal to 11 pN0 to pN1 disease. Patients were randomly assigned to four cycles of epirubicin (E) /cyclophoshamide (C)  followed by four cycles of docetaxel (T)  or six cycles of T C  (administered once every 3 weeks).

The protocol specified P = .05 for a noninferiority margin of 4.4% for all patients combined.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 3,198 registered patients, 348 (RS ≤ 11) omitted chemotherapy, and 401 were not randomly assigned.

Within the safety population (1,167 v 1,178 patients), 87.5% v 93.0% completed therapy. After a 60-month median follow-up, 5-year outcomes were similar in the EC-T and TC arms (DFS, 89.6% [95% CI, 87.9% to 91.5%] v 89.9% [95% CI, 88.1% to 91.8%]; OS, 94.5% [95% CI, 93.1% to 95.9%] v 94.7% [95% CI, 93.3% to 96.1%]). The DFS difference was within the noninferiority margin of the original trial design. Five treatment-related deaths were reported for TC (one for EC-T), despite a trend toward more-severe adverse events in the latter.

Patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure (CIOFF) were also eligible, but could be at risk of ovarian function recovery (OFR). The current analysis compared the survival of women with CIOFF with definitely postmenopausal women and examined the influence of OFR on survival. Therefore, we selected patients from the DATA study aged 45-57 years at randomization who had received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. They were classified by reversibility of postmenopausal status: possibly reversible in case of CIOFF (n = 395) versus definitely postmenopausal (n = 261). The former were monitored by E2 measurements for OFR. The occurrence of OFR was incorporated as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox-regression model for calculating the hazard ratio (HR). We used the landmark method to calculate residual 5-year survival rates. When comparing CIOFF women with definitely postmenopausal women, the survival was not different. Among CIOFF women with available E2 follow-up values (n = 329), experiencing OFR (n = 39) had an unfavorable impact on distant recurrence-free survival (HR 2.27 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-5.25; p = 0.05] and overall survival (HR 2.61 [95% CI 1.11-6.13; p = 0.03]). After adjusting for tumor features, the HRs became 2.11 (95% CI 0.89-5.02; p = 0.09) and 2.24 (95% CI 0.92-5.45; p = 0.07), respectively. The residual 5-year rate for distant recurrence-free survival was 76.9% for women with OFR and 92.1% for women without OFR, and for 5-year overall survival 80.8% and 94.4%, respectively. Women with CIOFF receiving anastrozole may be at increased risk of disease recurrence if experiencing OFR.",

        "Background/Purpose": "An estimated 10% of breast and ovarian cancers result from hereditary causes. Current testing guidelines for germ line susceptibility genes in patients with breast carcinoma were developed to identify carriers of BRCA1/ 2 variants and have evolved in the panel-testing era. We evaluated the capability of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to identify patients with breast cancer with pathogenic variants in expanded panel testing.",
        "Methods": "An institutional review board-approved multicenter prospective registry was initiated with 20 community and academic sites experienced in cancer genetic testing and counseling. Eligibility criteria included patients with a previously or newly diagnosed breast cancer who had not undergone either single- or multigene testing. Consecutive patients 18 to 90 years of age were consented and underwent an 80-gene panel test. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant electronic case report forms collected information on patient demographics, diagnoses, phenotypes, and test results.",
        "Results/Findings": "More than 1,000 patients were enrolled, and data records for 959 patients were analyzed; 49.95% met NCCN criteria, and 50.05% did not. Overall, 8.65% of patients had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. Of patients who met NCCN guidelines with test results, 9.39% had a P/LP variant. Of patients who did not meet guidelines, 7.9% had a P/LP variant. The difference in positive results between these groups was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test P = .4241).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results indicate that nearly half of patients with breast cancer with a P/LP variant with clinically actionable and/or management guidelines in development are missed by current testing guidelines. We recommend that all patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer undergo expanded panel testing.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces risk of breast cancer recurrence in those patients whose tumor tests hormone (estrogen and/or progesterone) receptor positive. Many who are prescribed AET do not adhere adequately. Studies have sought to examine the effects of interventions to enhance patients' AET adherence, with strikingly mixed results. In order to reconcile a disparate literature, this paper aims to (1) quantitatively review the aggregate effect of interventions designed to optimize AET adherence within the current literature and (2) meta-analyze these effects across studies' by intervention design.",
        "Methods": "Duplicate searches were conducted using multiple electronic databases as well as hand searches of recent year conference abstracts. Studies were included that (1) tested an intervention to promote AET adherence; (2) reported at least one measure of medication adherence; and (3) reported (or provided upon request) data sufficient to calculate effect size. Effect sizes were calculated using random effects models.",
        "Results/Findings": "Seven studies representing eight unique interventions were included. We observed an overall null effect across all interventions (k = 8; d [95% CI] = 0.28 [-0.05, 0.61]); however, sensitivity analyses showed that interventions that used bi-directional communication showed statistically significant effects relative to control groups within each study (k = 4; d [95% CI] = 0.59 [0.23, 0.95]) while those relying only on providing information to the patient (one-way communication) did not (k = 4; d [95% CI] = -0.03 [-0.27, 0.20]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Interventions that promote patient self-report may improve AET adherence through enhancing patient engagement. Investigators and clinicians who wish to optimize medication adherence in this population can consider this approach.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Previous studies reported increasing rates of metastatic breast cancer among young US women. However, these studies were based on limited geographic areas and did not account for the sharp decline in unknown-stage disease. In this study, we examined trends in early-onset breast cancer incidence rates by stage at diagnosis in a national dataset, after correcting for temporal changes in unstaged disease.",
        "Methods": "Using data from 42 states, covering 82% of the US population, we examined trends in incidence rates by stage at diagnosis and race/ethnicity in women ages 20-39 years. Stage was imputed for non-Hispanic (NH) white and NH black cases with missing information by distributing cases proportionally according to survival statistics.",
        "Results/Findings": "During 2001-2015, incidence rates of early-onset metastatic breast cancer increased sharply among NH white, NH black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women. Increasing trends were also observed for local-stage disease (all racial/ethnic groups) and regional-stage disease (NH white and API). In contrast, rates decreased sharply for unstaged disease among all groups. After imputing stage for cases with missing information, the increasing trends for regional- and distant-stage disease in NH whites and local-stage disease in NH blacks were no longer statistically significant, but the increase in distant-stage disease in NH blacks was unchanged.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After accounting for the sharp decline in unstaged cases, the increase in incidence rates for distant-stage disease became non-significant in NH whites but not in NH blacks. Future studies should consider accounting for temporal changes in unstaged disease when examining stage-specific incidence trends.",

        "Results/Findings": "Data for cases and controls were from the French Reference Centre of Teratogenic Agents. Cases were women who received BPs in the 6 weeks before or during a pregnancy and had systemic or bone diseases.

        "Methods": "We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive talazoparib (1 mg once daily) or standard single-agent therapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine in continuous 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 431 patients who underwent randomization, 287 were assigned to receive talazoparib and 144 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.71; P<0.001). The interim median hazard ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06; P=0.11 [57% of projected events]). The objective response rate was higher in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (62.6% vs. 27.2%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.8; P<0.001). Hematologic grade 3-4 adverse events (primarily anemia) occurred in 55% of the patients who received talazoparib and in 38% of the patients who received standard therapy; nonhematologic grade 3 adverse events occurred in 32% and 38% of the patients, respectively. Patient-reported outcomes favored talazoparib; significant overall improvements and significant delays in the time to clinically meaningful deterioration according to both the global health status-quality-of-life and breast symptoms scales were observed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation, single-agent talazoparib provided a significant benefit over standard chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival.

        "Background/Purpose": "This article summarises the information that should be provided to women and referring physicians about breast ultrasound (US). After explaining the physical principles, technical procedure and safety of US, information is given about its ability to make a correct diagnosis, depending on the setting in which it is applied. The following definite indications for breast US in female subjects are proposed: palpable lump; axillary adenopathy; first diagnostic approach for clinical abnormalities under 40 and in pregnant or lactating women; suspicious abnormalities at mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); suspicious nipple discharge; recent nipple inversion; skin retraction; breast inflammation; abnormalities in the area of the surgical scar after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy; abnormalities in the presence of breast implants; screening high-risk women, especially when MRI is not performed; loco-regional staging of a known breast cancer, when MRI is not performed; guidance for percutaneous interventions (needle biopsy, pre-surgical localisation, fluid collection drainage); monitoring patients with breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant therapy, when MRI is not performed. Possible indications such as supplemental screening after mammography for women aged 40-74 with dense breasts are also listed. Moreover, inappropriate indications include screening for breast cancer as a stand-alone alternative to mammography. The structure and organisation of the breast US report and of classification systems such as the BI-RADS and consequent management recommendations are illustrated. Information about additional or new US technologies (colour-Doppler, elastography, and automated whole breast US) is also provided. Finally, five frequently asked questions are answered.",
        "Methods": "• US is an established tool for suspected cancers at all ages and also the method of choice under 40. • For US-visible suspicious lesions, US-guided biopsy is preferred, even for palpable findings. • High-risk women can be screened with US, especially when MRI cannot be performed. • Supplemental US increases cancer detection but also false positives, biopsy rate and follow-up exams. • Breast US is inappropriate as a stand-alone screening method.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Poor breast cancer survival in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) can be attributed to advanced-stage presentation and poor access to systemic therapy. We aimed to estimate the outcomes of different early detection strategies in combination with systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in LMICs.",
        "Methods": "We adapted a microsimulation model to project outcomes of three early detection strategies alone or in combination with three systemic treatment programmes beyond standard of care (programme A): programme B was endocrine therapy for all oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive cases; programme C was programme B plus chemotherapy for ER-negative cases; programme D was programme C plus chemotherapy for advanced ER-positive cases. The main outcomes were reductions in breast cancer-related mortality and lives saved per 100 000 women relative to the standard of care for women aged 30-49 years in a low-income setting (East Africa; using incidence data and life tables from Uganda and data on tumour characteristics from various East African countries) and for women aged 50-69 years in a middle-income setting (Colombia).",
        "Results/Findings": "In the East African setting, relative mortality reductions were 8-41%, corresponding to 23 (95% uncertainty interval -12 to 49) to 114 (80 to 138) lives saved per 100 000 women over 10 years. In Colombia, mortality reductions were 7-25%, corresponding to 32 (-29 to 70) to 105 (61 to 141) lives saved per 100 000 women over 10 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The best projected outcomes were in settings where access to both early detection and adjuvant therapy is improved. Even in the absence of mammographic screening, improvements in detection can provide substantial benefit in settings where advanced-stage presentation is common.",

In addition, pretreatment AMH was a predictor for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml after long-term follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses gave area under the curve of 0.805 for resumption of menstruation and 0.903 for serum AMH concentration ≥ 1 ng/ml at 12 months, when age, tamoxifen use, pretreatment FSH, and AMH were combined.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) produced an evidence-based guideline on use of integrative therapies during and after breast cancer treatment that was determined to be relevant to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) membership. ASCO considered the guideline for endorsement. Methods The SIO guideline addressed the use of integrative therapies for the management of symptoms and adverse effects, such as anxiety and stress, mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Interventions of interest included mind and body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications. SIO systematic reviews focused on randomized controlled trials that were published from 1990 through 2015. The SIO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations in the SIO guideline-published in 2017-are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline with a few added discussion points. Recommendations Key recommendations include the following: Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-l-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because of a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related adverse effects.

The addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not result in significantly lower recurrence rates than those with tamoxifen alone. Here, we report the updated results from the two trials.",
        "Methods": "Premenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive 5 years of tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, or exemestane plus ovarian suppression in SOFT and to receive tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression or exemestane plus ovarian suppression in TEXT. Randomization was stratified according to the receipt of chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "In SOFT, the 8-year disease-free survival rate was 78.9% with tamoxifen alone, 83.2% with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 85.9% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.009 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression). The 8-year rate of overall survival was 91.5% with tamoxifen alone, 93.3% with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 92.1% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.01 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression); among the women who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy, the rates were 85.1%, 89.4%, and 87.2%, respectively. Among the women with cancers that were negative for HER2 who received chemotherapy, the 8-year rate of distant recurrence with exemestane plus ovarian suppression was lower than the rate with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression (by 7.0 percentage points in SOFT and by 5.0 percentage points in TEXT). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 24.6% of the tamoxifen-alone group, 31.0% of the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group, and 32.3% of the exemestane-ovarian suppression group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among premenopausal women with breast cancer, the addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen resulted in significantly higher 8-year rates of both disease-free and overall survival than tamoxifen alone. The use of exemestane plus ovarian suppression resulted in even higher rates of freedom from recurrence. The frequency of adverse events was higher in the two groups that received ovarian suppression than in the tamoxifen-alone group.

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose The role of temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) during chemotherapy as a strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis using individual patient-level data was conducted to better assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy in patients with early breast cancer. Methods The trials in which premenopausal women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa were eligible for inclusion. Primary end points were premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) rate and post-treatment pregnancy rate. Disease-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points. Because each study represents a cluster, statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Results A total of 873 patients from five trials were included. POI rate was 14.1% in the GnRHa group and 30.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; P < .001). A total of 37 (10.3%) patients had at least one post-treatment pregnancy in the GnRHa group and 20 (5.5%) in the control group (incidence rate ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.15; P = .030). No significant differences in disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.42; P = .999) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.06; P = .083) were observed between groups. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of temporary ovarian suppression with GnRHa during chemotherapy as an available option to reduce the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced POI and potentially improve future fertility in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are given as adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, also to those with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure. The current analysis reports on endocrine data of patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure who were included in the phase III DATA study assessing different durations of adjuvant anastrozole after tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "We identified all patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure. Women who underwent a bilateral ovariectomy or used luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists before random assignment were excluded. Plasma estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were monitored until 30 months after random assignment at local laboratories. We aimed to determine the ovarian function recovery (OFR) rate during AI use by the cumulative incidence competing risk method and analyzed the trend of estradiol levels during AI use by a nested case-control approach in which a subset of control subjects were compared with the OFR patients excluding the value at OFR diagnosis.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 329 eligible patients had a median age of 50.0 years (range = 45-57 years) at random assignment. Thirty-nine patients developed OFR, corresponding with a 30-month recovery rate of 12.4%. Of these, 11 (28.2%) were age 50 years or older at AI initiation. The estradiol level decreased statistically significantly by 37.8% (95% CI = 27.4% to 46.7%) over the initial 30 months of AI treatment in both groups. However, the estradiol levels in the women who experienced OFR remained statistically significantly higher (difference = 20.6%, 95% CI = 2.0% to 42.7%) prior to OFR diagnosis compared with those who did not experience OFR.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The risk of OFR during AI treatment in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure is relevant, even beyond 45 years. Furthermore, women experiencing OFR had statistically significant higher estradiol levels during AI treatment (before OFR) than those without, with potential consequences regarding efficacy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose Isolated locoregional recurrence (ILRR) predicts a high risk of developing breast cancer distant metastases and death. The Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for LOcally Recurrent breast cancer (CALOR) trial investigated the effectiveness of chemotherapy (CT) after local therapy for ILRR. A report at 5 years of median follow-up showed significant benefit of CT for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative ILRR, but additional follow-up was required in ER-positive ILRR. Patients and Methods CALOR was an open-label, randomized trial for patients with completely excised ILRR after unilateral breast cancer. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive CT or no CT and stratified by prior CT, hormone receptor status, and location of ILRR. Patients with hormone receptor-positive ILRR received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Radiation therapy was mandated for patients with microscopically involved margins, and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy was optional. End points were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival, and breast cancer-free interval. Results From August 2003 to January 2010, 162 patients were enrolled: 58 with ER-negative and 104 with ER-positive ILRR. At 9 years of median follow-up, 27 DFS events were observed in the ER-negative group and 40 in the ER-positive group. The hazard ratios (HR) of a DFS event were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67; 10-year DFS, 70% v 34%, CT v no CT, respectively) in patients with ER-negative ILRR and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.57 to 2.00; 10-year DFS, 50% v 59%, respectively) in patients with ER-positive ILRR ( P  = .013). HRs were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.85), respectively, for breast cancer-free interval ( P  = .034) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.19 to 1.20) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.55), respectively, for overall survival ( P  = .53). Results for the three end points were consistent in multivariable analyses adjusting for location of ILRR, prior CT, and interval from primary surgery. Conclusion The final analysis of CALOR confirms that CT benefits patients with resected ER-negative ILRR and does not support the use of CT for ER-positive ILRR.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The appropriate negative margin width for women undergoing breast-conserving surgery for both ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma is controversial. This review examines the available data on the margin status for invasive breast cancer and DCIS, and highlights the similarities and differences in tumor biology and standard treatments that affect the local recurrence (LR) risk and, therefore, the optimal surgical margin. Consensus guidelines support a negative margin, defined as no ink on tumor, for invasive carcinoma treated with breast-conserving therapy. Because of differences in the growth pattern and utilization of systemic therapy, a margin of 2 mm has been found to minimize the LR risk for women with DCIS undergoing lumpectomy and radiation therapy (RT). Wider negative margins do not improve local control for DCIS or invasive carcinoma when they are treated with lumpectomy and RT. Re-excision for negative margins should be individualized, and the routine practice of performing additional surgery to obtain a wider negative margin is not supported by the literature.

        "Methods": "This study was a phase 3, open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial ( ). Two hundred sixteen premenopausal patients (under 45 years) diagnosed with invasive ER-positive breast cancer were enrolled from July 2009 to May 2013 and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy combined with sequential or simultaneous GnRHa treatment. All patients were advised to receive GnRHa for at least 2 years. The primary outcome was the incidence of early menopause, defined as amenorrhea lasting longer than 12 months after the last chemotherapy or GnRHa dose, with postmenopausal or unknown follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels. The menstrual resumption period and survivals were the secondary endpoints.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up time was 56.9 months (IQR 49.5-72.4 months). One hundred and eight patients were enrolled in each group. Among them, 92 and 78 patients had complete primary endpoint data in the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively. The rates of early menopause were 22.8% (21/92) in the sequential group and 23.1% (18/78) in the simultaneous group [simultaneous vs. sequential: OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.50-2.08); p = 0.969; age-adjusted OR 1.13; (95% CI 0.54-2.37); p = 0.737]. The median menstruation resumption period was 12.0 (95% CI 9.3-14.7) months and 10.3 (95% CI 8.2-12.4) months for the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59-1.16); p = 0.274; age-adjusted HR 0.90 (95%CI 0.64-1.27); p = 0.567]. No significant differences were evident for disease-free survival (p = 0.290) or overall survival (p = 0.514) between the two groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For ER-positive premenopausal patients, the sequential use of GnRHa and chemotherapy showed ovarian preservation and survival outcomes that were no worse than simultaneous use. The application of GnRHa can probably be delayed until menstruation resumption after chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Chemotherapy results in permanent loss of ovarian function in some premenopausal women. Accurate identification in women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer (eBC) would allow optimisation of subsequent endocrine treatment. We sought to assess whether analysis of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) using a sensitive automated assay could identify women who would not regain ovarian function after chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "Data from women in the Ovarian Protection Trial in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients (OPTION) trial of goserelin (a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue) for ovarian protection were analysed. Women were assessed for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI: amenorrhoea with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) at 24 months after diagnosis. The accuracy of AMH for the diagnosis of POI and its prediction from measurement at the end of chemotherapy was calculated.",
        "Results/Findings": "AMH below the level of detection showed good diagnostic accuracy for POI at 24 months (n = 73) with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve of 0.86, sensitivity 1.0 and specificity 0.73 at the assay limit of detection. In women aged >40 at diagnosis who did not receive goserelin, AMH measured at end of chemotherapy also gave good prediction of POI at 24 months (area under the curve (AUC) 0.89 95% CI 0.75-1.0, n = 32), with sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.82, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 42.8. FSH gave slightly lower AUC, and specificity was low at 0.55. Age but not tamoxifen impacted on AMH levels.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Using this sensitive AMH assay, the finding of an undetectable AMH level in women aged >40 at the end of chemotherapy for eBC gave a good prediction that ovarian function would not return. This may allow alterations in post-chemotherapy endocrine management.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The administration of endocrine therapy for 5 years substantially reduces recurrence rates during and after treatment in women with early-stage, estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Extending such therapy beyond 5 years offers further protection but has additional side effects. Obtaining data on the absolute risk of subsequent distant recurrence if therapy stops at 5 years could help determine whether to extend treatment.",
        "Methods": "In this meta-analysis of the results of 88 trials involving 62,923 women with ER-positive breast cancer who were disease-free after 5 years of scheduled endocrine therapy, we used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, stratified according to trial and treatment, to assess the associations of tumor diameter and nodal status (TN), tumor grade, and other factors with patients' outcomes during the period from 5 to 20 years.",
        "Results/Findings": "Breast-cancer recurrences occurred at a steady rate throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status. Among the patients with stage T1 disease, the risk of distant recurrence was 13% with no nodal involvement (T1N0), 20% with one to three nodes involved (T1N1-3), and 34% with four to nine nodes involved (T1N4-9); among those with stage T2 disease, the risks were 19% with T2N0, 26% with T2N1-3, and 41% with T2N4-9. The risk of death from breast cancer was similarly dependent on TN status, but the risk of contralateral breast cancer was not. Given the TN status, the factors of tumor grade (available in 43,590 patients) and Ki-67 status (available in 7692 patients), which are strongly correlated with each other, were of only moderate independent predictive value for distant recurrence, but the status regarding the progesterone receptor (in 54,115 patients) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) (in 15,418 patients in trials with no use of trastuzumab) was not predictive. During the study period from 5 to 20 years, the absolute risk of distant recurrence among patients with T1N0 breast cancer was 10% for low-grade disease, 13% for moderate-grade disease, and 17% for high-grade disease; the corresponding risks of any recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer were 17%, 22%, and 26%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, breast-cancer recurrences continued to occur steadily throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status, with risks ranging from 10 to 41%, depending on TN status and tumor grade.

Pooled analysis revealed an overall rate of reconstructive failure of 17.6% and Baker grade III/IV capsular contracture of 37.5%. PMRT applied to tissue expanders resulted in higher rates of reconstructive failure compared with PMRT applied to permanent silicone implants (20% versus 13.4%, RR = 2.33, P = 0.0083, 95% confidence interval 1.24-4.35), but lower rates of capsular contracture (24.5% versus 49.4%, RR = 0.53, P = 0.083, 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.09).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Regardless of timing, PMRT applied to implant-based breast reconstruction was associated with high risk of reconstructive failure and capsular contracture. Surgeons should consider alternative strategies, such as autologous tissue reconstructions, in patients requiring PMRT.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Recent breast cancer treatment guidelines recommend that higher-risk premenopausal patients should receive ovarian function suppression (OFS) as part of adjuvant endocrine therapy. If chemotherapy is also given, it is uncertain whether to select concurrent or sequential OFS initiation.",
        "Methods": "We analyzed 1872 patients enrolled in the randomized phase III TEXT and SOFT trials who received adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and upon randomization to an OFS-containing adjuvant endocrine therapy, initiated gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonist triptorelin. Breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was compared between patients who received OFS concurrently with chemotherapy in TEXT (n = 1242) versus sequentially post-chemotherapy in SOFT (n = 630). Because timing of trial enrollment relative to adjuvant chemotherapy differed, we implemented landmark analysis re-defining BCFI beginning 1 year after final dose of chemotherapy (median, 15.5 and 8.1 months from enrollment to landmark in TEXT and SOFT, respectively). As a non-randomized treatment comparison, we implemented comparative-effectiveness propensity score methodology with weighted Cox modeling.",
        "Results/Findings": "Distributions of several clinico-pathologic characteristics differed between groups. Patients who were premenopausal post-chemotherapy in SOFT were younger on average. The median duration of adjuvant chemotherapy was 18 weeks in both groups. There were 231 (12%) BC events after post-landmark median follow-up of about 5 years. Concurrent use of triptorelin with chemotherapy was not associated with a significant difference in post-landmark BCFI compared with sequential triptorelin post-chemotherapy, either in the overall population (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.72-1.72; P = 0.72; 4-year BCFI 89% in both groups), or in the subgroup of 692 women <40 years at diagnosis (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.69-1.84) who are less likely to develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Based on comparative-effectiveness modeling of TEXT and SOFT after about 5 years median follow-up, with limited statistical power especially for the subgroup <40 years, neither detrimental nor beneficial effect of concurrent administration of OFS with chemotherapy on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy that includes chemotherapy was detected.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Skin-sparing (SSM) and nipple-sparing (NSM) mastectomies are relatively new conservative surgical approaches to breast cancer. In SSM most of the breast skin is conserved to create a pocket that facilitates immediate breast reconstruction with implant or autologous graft to achieve a quality cosmetic outcome. NSM is closely similar except that the nipple-areola complex (NAC) is also conserved. Meta-analyses indicate that outcomes for SSM and NSM do not differ from those for non-conservative mastectomies. Recurrence rates in the NAC after NSM are acceptably low (0-3.7%). Other studies indicate that NSM is associated with high patient satisfaction and good psychological adjustment. Indications are carcinoma or DCIS that require mastectomy (including after neoadjuvant chemotherapy). NSM is also suitable for women undergoing risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy. Tumor not less than 2 cm from the NAC is recommended, but may be less important than no evidence of nipple involvement on mandatory intraoperative nipple margin assessment. A positive margin is an absolute contraindication for nipple preservation. Other contraindications are microcalcifications close to the subareolar region and a positive nipple discharge. Complication rates are similar to those for other types of post-mastectomy reconstructions. The main complication of NSM is NAC necrosis, however as surgeon experience matures, frequency declines. Factors associated with complications are voluminous breast, ptosis, smoking, obesity, and radiotherapy. Since the access incision is small, breast tissue may be left behind, so only experienced breast surgeons should do these operations in close collaboration with the plastic surgeon. For breast cancer patients requiring mastectomy, NSM should be the option of choice.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose To describe benefits and toxicities of adjuvant endocrine therapies in women younger than 35 years with breast cancer (n = 582) enrolled in the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) and Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT). Methods In SOFT, women still premenopausal after surgery with or without chemotherapy were randomly assigned to tamoxifen alone, tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS), or exemestane plus OFS. In TEXT, all received OFS with or without concomitant chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. We summarize treatment efficacy, quality of life, and adherence of the cohort of women younger than 35 years in SOFT and TEXT, alongside data from the cohort of older premenopausal women. Results For 240 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative patients younger than 35 years enrolled in SOFT after receiving chemotherapy, the 5-year breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was 67.1% (95% CI, 54.6% to 76.9%) with tamoxifen alone, 75.9% with tamoxifen plus OFS (95% CI, 64.0% to 84.4%), and 83.2% with exemestane plus OFS (95% CI, 72.7% to 90.0%). For 145 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative patients younger than 35 years in TEXT, 5-year BCFI was 79.2% (95% CI, 66.2% to 87.7%) with tamoxifen plus OFS and 81.6% (95% CI, 69.8% to 89.2%) with exemestane plus OFS. The most prominent quality of life symptom for patients younger than 35 years receiving OFS was vasomotor symptoms, with the greatest worsening from baseline at 6 months (on the order of 30 to 40 points), but loss of sexual interest and difficulties in becoming aroused were also clinically meaningful (≥ 8-point change). The level of symptom burden was similar in older premenopausal women. A total of 19.8% of women younger than 35 years stopped all protocol-assigned endocrine therapy early. Conclusion In women younger than 35 years with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, adjuvant OFS combined with tamoxifen or exemestane produces large improvements in BCFI compared with tamoxifen alone. Menopausal symptoms are significant but are not worse than those seen in older premenopausal women.",

This meta-analysis examines the association between pre-operative MRI and surgical outcomes in BC.",
        "Methods": "A systematic review was performed to identify studies reporting quantitative data on pre-operative MRI and surgical outcomes (without restriction by type of surgery received or type of BC) and using a controlled design. Random-effects logistic regression calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) for each surgical outcome (MRI vs. no-MRI groups), and estimated ORs stratified by study-level age. Subgroup analysis was performed for invasive lobular cancer (ILC).",
        "Results/Findings": "Nineteen studies met eligibility criteria: 3 RCTs and 16 comparative studies that included newly diagnosed BC of any type except for three studies restricted to ILC. Primary analysis (85,975 subjects) showed that pre-operative MRI was associated with increased odds of receiving mastectomy [OR 1.39 (1.23, 1.57); p < 0.001]; similar findings were shown in analyses stratified by study-level median age. Secondary analyses did not find statistical evidence of an effect of MRI on the rates of re-excision, re-operation, or positive margins; however, MRI was significantly associated with increased odds of receiving contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [OR 1.91 (1.25, 2.91); p = 0.003]. Subgroup analysis for ILC did not find any association between MRI and the odds of receiving mastectomy [OR 1.00 (0.75, 1.33); p = 0.988] or the odds of re-excision [OR 0.65 (0.35, 1.24); p = 0.192].",

        "Background/Purpose": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition caused by germline mutations of the   tumor suppressor gene encoding p53, a transcription factor triggered as a protective cellular mechanism against different stressors. Loss of p53 function renders affected individuals highly susceptible to a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers. It has recently become evident that children and adults with LFS benefit from intensive surveillance aimed at early tumor detection. In October 2016, the American Association for Cancer Research held a meeting of international LFS experts to evaluate the current knowledge on LFS and propose consensus surveillance recommendations. Herein, we briefly summarize clinical and genetic aspects of this aggressive cancer predisposition syndrome. In addition, the expert panel concludes that there are sufficient existing data to recommend that all patients with LFS be offered cancer surveillance as soon as the clinical or molecular LFS diagnosis is established. Specifically, the panel recommends adoption of a modified version of the \"Toronto protocol\" that includes a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging. The panel also recommends that further research be promoted to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of these risk-adapted surveillance and cancer prevention strategies while addressing the psychosocial needs of individuals and families with LFS.",

        "Methods": "We randomly assigned 910 patients with HER2-negative residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (containing anthracycline, taxane, or both) to receive standard postsurgical treatment either with capecitabine or without (control). The primary end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "The result of the prespecified interim analysis met the primary end point, so this trial was terminated early. The final analysis showed that disease-free survival was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (74.1% vs. 67.6% of the patients were alive and free from recurrence or second cancer at 5 years; hazard ratio for recurrence, second cancer, or death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.92; P=0.01). Overall survival was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (89.2% vs. 83.6% of the patients were alive at 5 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.90; P=0.01). Among patients with triple-negative disease, the rate of disease-free survival was 69.8% in the capecitabine group versus 56.1% in the control group (hazard ratio for recurrence, second cancer, or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87), and the overall survival rate was 78.8% versus 70.3% (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.90).

        "Methods": "This was a prospective, randomized, parallel group study of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist goserelin administered before and during chemotherapy for breast cancer with stage I-IIIB disease. The primary outcome was amenorrhoea between 12 and 24 months after randomization, supported by elevated follicle stimulating hormone concentrations to give an additional analysis as rate of POI.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 227 patients were randomized and the primary analysis was conducted on 202 patients. Goserelin reduced the prevalence of amenorrhoea between 12 and 24 months to 22% versus 38% in the control group (P = 0.015) and the prevalence of POI to 18.5% versus 34.8% in the control group (P = 0.048). Follicle stimulating hormone concentrations were also lower in all women treated with goserelin at both 12 and 24 months (P = 0.027, P = 0.001, respectively). The effect of goserelin was not statistically significant in women >40 years. Assessment of the ovarian reserve using anti-Müllerian hormone showed a marked fall in both groups during treatment to median values of 5% of pretreatment levels in the control group and 7% in the goserelin group, which were not significantly different between groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study shows that goserelin reduced the risk of POI in women treated with chemotherapy for early breast cancer, with particular efficacy in women aged ≤40 years old.

We then performed Cox proportional-hazards regression to examine breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in women diagnosed between 1998 and 2007, who underwent breast-conserving surgery with radiation (breast-conserving therapy), unilateral mastectomy, or CPM, with subsequent subgroup analysis stratifying by age and HR status.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 496,488 women diagnosed with unilateral invasive breast cancer, 59.6% underwent breast-conserving surgery, 33.4% underwent unilateral mastectomy, and 7.0% underwent CPM. Overall, the proportion of women undergoing CPM increased from 3.9% in 2002 to 12.7% in 2012 (P < 0.001). Reconstructive surgery was performed in 48.3% of CPM patients compared with only 16.0% of unilateral mastectomy patients, with rates of reconstruction with CPM rising from 35.3% in 2002 to 55.4% in 2012 (P < 0.001). When compared with breast-conserving therapy, we found no significant improvement in BCSS or OS for women undergoing CPM (BCSS: HR 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; OS: HR 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.14), regardless of HR status or age.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In the United Kingdom, current screening guidelines for TP53 germline mutation carriers solely recommends annual breast MRI, despite the wide spectrum of malignancies typically seen in this group. This study sought to investigate the role of one-off non-contrast whole-body MRI (WB MRI) in the screening of asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers. 44 TP53 mutation carriers and 44 population controls were recruited. Scans were read by radiologists blinded to participant carrier status. The incidence of malignancies diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers against general population controls was calculated. The incidences of non-malignant relevant disease and irrelevant disease were measured, as well as the number of investigations required to determine relevance of findings. In TP53 mutation carriers, 6 of 44 (13.6, 95% CI 5.2-27.4%) participants were diagnosed with cancer during the study, all of which would be considered life threatening if untreated. Two were found to have two primary cancers. Two participants with cancer had abnormalities on the MRI which were initially thought to be benign (a pericardial cyst and a uterine fibroid) but transpired to be sarcomas. No controls were diagnosed with cancer. Fifteen carriers (34.1, 95% CI 20.5-49.9%) and seven controls (15.9, 95% CI 6.7-30.1%) underwent further investigations following the WB MRI for abnormalities that transpired to be benign (p = 0.049). The cancer detection rate in this group justifies a minimum baseline non-contrast WB MRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers. This should be adopted into national guidelines for management of adult TP53 mutation carriers in addition to the current practice of contrast enhanced breast MRI imaging.",

As a consequence, the complex needs of patients living with the disease and their care-givers should be addressed not only in terms of supportive and palliative care but also of \"survivorship\" requirements. The multidisciplinary approach to advanced breast cancer should encompass - early in the history of the disease - not only physical but also functional, social, psychological and spiritual domains. It is important to clearly define the disease context with patients and families (\"chronic\" preferred to \"incurable\"), addressing the concept of uncertainty, and tailoring the treatment strategy according to both disease status and individual priorities. Specific psychosocial needs of young and elderly women and male patients - i.e. social security, job flexibility, rehabilitation (including sexuality), home and child care - should be recognized and supported.

We sought to provide prospective evidence of the clinical utility of the addition of the 70-gene signature to standard clinical-pathological criteria in selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "In this randomized, phase 3 study, we enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer and determined their genomic risk (using the 70-gene signature) and their clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online). Women at low clinical and genomic risk did not receive chemotherapy, whereas those at high clinical and genomic risk did receive such therapy. In patients with discordant risk results, either the genomic risk or the clinical risk was used to determine the use of chemotherapy. The primary goal was to assess whether, among patients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression profile who did not receive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastasis would be 92% (i.e., the noninferiority boundary) or higher.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1550 patients (23.2%) were deemed to be at high clinical risk and low genomic risk. At 5 years, the rate of survival without distant metastasis in this group was 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 92.5 to 96.2) among those not receiving chemotherapy. The absolute difference in this survival rate between these patients and those who received chemotherapy was 1.5 percentage points, with the rate being lower without chemotherapy. Similar rates of survival without distant metastasis were reported in the subgroup of patients who had estrogen-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and either node-negative or node-positive disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings, approximately 46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might not require chemotherapy.

        "Background/Purpose": "Evidence shows that both biological and nonbiological factors contribute to health disparities. Genetics, in particular, plays a part in how common diseases manifest themselves. Today, unprecedented advances in genetically based diagnoses and treatments provide opportunities for personalized medicine. However, disadvantaged groups may lack access to these advances, and treatments based on research on non-Hispanic whites might not be generalizable to members of minority groups. Unless genetic technologies become universally accessible, existing disparities could be widened. Addressing this issue will require integrated strategies, including expanding genetic research, improving genetic literacy, and enhancing access to genetic technologies among minority populations in a way that avoids harms such as stigmatization.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Carriers of a germline TP53 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk of developing cancer. In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or not. We sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol.",
        "Methods": "A clinical surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging studies (consisting of whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI, mammography, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres in Canada and the USA on Jan 1, 2004, for carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants. After confirmation of TP53 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. Patients could cross over between groups at any time. The primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic tumours by surveillance investigations. The secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established from a tumour diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one diagnosed by surveillance. We completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 1, 2004, and July 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) patients crossed over from the non-surveillance to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance for a median of 32 months (IQR 12-87). 40 asymptomatic tumours have been detected in 19 (32%) of 59 patients who underwent surveillance. Two additional cancers were diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). Among the 49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic tumours were diagnosed in 43 (88%) patients. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance who developed cancer were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing surveillance who developed cancer (p=0·012) after a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance. 5 year overall survival was 88·8% (95% CI 78·7-100) in the surveillance group and 59·6% (47·2-75·2) in the non-surveillance group (p=0·0132).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol for early tumour detection in individuals with pathogenic TP53 variants is feasible and that early tumour detection through surveillance is associated with improved long-term survival. Incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these patients should be considered.",

        "Methods": "Using PRISMA guidelines, five electronic databases were systematically searched for published studies examining maternal breast cancer and the psychosocial functioning of children.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 15 studies contributed to the analysis. Results from a random effects meta-analysis show that children experience marginally elevated internalizing problems (standardized mean difference=.14, 95% CI .00, .28), significantly fewer total problem behaviors (standardized mean difference=-.13, 95% CI -.23, -.03), and no changes in externalizing problems (standardized mean difference=-.07, 95% CI -.19, .05) relative to comparison groups. Consistent with this, the narrative review suggests the children may experience elevated depression, anxiety and mental distress yet show more social competence and little aggressive or disruptive behavior. Significant moderating variables included informant type (i.e., self-ratings vs mother's ratings vs other's ratings) and comparison group used (i.e., controls vs normative data). There is also evidence that illness severity and maternal mental health may impact the results.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results suggest that children may be at risk for internalizing-type problems, especially when their mother experiences depression and has serious medical complications.

Although previous studies have shown a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence and death among young women with early-stage breast cancer, they have not adequately addressed the role of tumor subtype in outcomes.",
        "Methods": "We examined data from women with newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer presenting to one of eight National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers between January 2000 and December 2007. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between age and breast cancer-specific survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 17,575 women with stage I to III breast cancer were eligible for analysis, among whom 1,916 were ≤ 40 years of age at diagnosis. Median follow-up time was 6.4 years. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model controlling for sociodemographic, disease, and treatment characteristics, women ≤ 40 years of age at diagnosis had greater breast cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.7). In stratified analyses, age ≤ 40 years was associated with statistically significant increases in risk of breast cancer death among women with luminal A (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2) and luminal B (HR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9) tumors, with borderline significance among women with triple-negative tumors (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8) but not among those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 subtypes (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.9). In an additional model controlling for detection method, young age was associated with significantly increased risk of breast cancer death only among women with luminal A tumors.",

        "Background/Purpose": "A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of radiation-induced ovarian ablation (RT-OA) on amenorrhea cessation rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival in pre/perimenopausal women with breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "The Medline, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane Library databases and search engines were searched to identify randomized controlled studies comparing RT-OA with control for early or metastatic breast cancer. Further, radiotherapy doses, techniques, and associated side effects were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "Six controlled trials with a total patient population of 3,317 were identified. Pooled results from these trials showed significant amenorrhea rates (P<0.00001) and increase in progression-free survival in patients treated with RT-OA (P<0.00001). However, there was no difference in overall survival (P=0.37). The majority of patients were treated with larger field sizes with parallel-opposed anteroposterior and posteroanterior pelvic fields. RT-OA was generally well tolerated. Radiotherapy doses of 1,500 cGy in five fractions, 1,500 cGy in four fractions, 1,600 cGy in four fractions, and 2,000 cGy in ten fractions were associated with excellent amenorrhea rates. The resultant funnel plot showed no publication bias (Egger test P=0.16).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "RT-OA is cost-effective and can safely be used in pre/perimenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, or if luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs are contraindicated, or in patients in whom fertility preservation is not an issue. Radiation dose of 1,500 cGy in five fractions, 1,500 cGy in four fractions, 1,600 cGy in four fractions, and 2,000 cGy in ten fractions showed more efficacies. However, further studies incorporating three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy are warranted.",

        "Results/Findings": "Two trials investigating the addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not show an overall clinical benefit for ovarian suppression. Nonetheless, the addition of ovarian suppression to standard adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen or with an aromatase inhibitor improved disease-free survival and improved freedom from breast cancer and distant recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone among the subset of patients who were at sufficient risk for recurrence such that adjuvant chemotherapy was warranted. Compared with tamoxifen alone, ovarian suppression was associated with a substantial increase in menopausal symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and diminished quality of life.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The Panel recommends that higher-risk patients should receive ovarian suppression in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy, whereas lower-risk patients should not. Women with stage II or III breast cancers who would ordinarily be advised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy should receive ovarian suppression with endocrine therapy. The panel recommends that some women with stage I or II breast cancers at higher risk of recurrence who might consider chemotherapy may also be offered ovarian suppression with endocrine therapy. Women with stage I breast cancers not warranting chemotherapy should not receive ovarian suppression, nor should women with node-negative cancers 1 cm or less. Ovarian suppression may be administered with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of the American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline is to provide recommendations to assist primary care and other clinicians in the care of female adult survivors of breast cancer. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A total of 1,073 articles met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical examination, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for post-treatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment, health promotion, and care coordination/practice implications are made.This guideline was developed through a collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Journal of Clinical Oncology.

A reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay of 21 genes was performed on the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and the results were used to calculate a score indicating the risk of breast-cancer recurrence; patients were assigned to receive endocrine therapy without chemotherapy if they had a recurrence score of 0 to 10, indicating a very low risk of recurrence (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of recurrence).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 10,253 eligible women enrolled, 1626 women (15.9%) who had a recurrence score of 0 to 10 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone without chemotherapy. At 5 years, in this patient population, the rate of invasive disease-free survival was 93.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.4 to 94.9), the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.6), the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or local-regional site was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.9 to 99.2), and the rate of overall survival was 98.0% (95% CI, 97.1 to 98.6).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who met established guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features, those with tumors that had a favorable gene-expression profile had very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy alone.

Proactive discussions by healthcare providers early on in treatment, and referrals to relevant services as part of standard care are needed to mitigate younger women's concerns and reduce the likelihood of problems becoming longstanding.",

        "Background/Purpose": "This paper summarizes information about breast MRI to be provided to women and referring physicians. After listing contraindications, procedure details are described, stressing the need for correct scheduling and not moving during the examination. The structured report including BI-RADS® categories and further actions after a breast MRI examination are discussed. Breast MRI is a very sensitive modality, significantly improving screening in high-risk women. It also has a role in clinical diagnosis, problem solving, and staging, impacting on patient management. However, it is not a perfect test, and occasionally breast cancers can be missed. Therefore, clinical and other imaging findings (from mammography/ultrasound) should also be considered. Conversely, MRI may detect lesions not visible on other imaging modalities turning out to be benign (false positives). These risks should be discussed with women before a breast MRI is requested/performed. Because breast MRI drawbacks depend upon the indication for the examination, basic information for the most important breast MRI indications is presented. Seventeen notes and five frequently asked questions formulated for use as direct communication to women are provided. The text was reviewed by Europa Donna-The European Breast Cancer Coalition to ensure that it can be easily understood by women undergoing MRI.",
        "Methods": "• Information on breast MRI concerns advantages/disadvantages and preparation to the examination • Claustrophobia, implantable devices, allergic predisposition, and renal function should be checked • Before menopause, scheduling on day 7-14 of the cycle is preferred • During the examination, it is highly important that the patient keeps still • Availability of prior examinations improves accuracy of breast MRI interpretation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists provide effective adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Here, we investigated appropriate treatment durations of an LH-RH agonist, leuprorelin.",
        "Methods": "We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of leuprorelin subcutaneously administered every-3-months for 2 versus 3 or more, up to 5 years, together with daily tamoxifen for 5 years in premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "Eligible patients (N = 222) were randomly assigned to receive leuprorelin for either 2 years (N = 112) or 3 or more years (N = 110) with tamoxifen for 5 years after surgery. Leuprorelin treatment for 3 or more years provided no significant difference in DFS rate over 2 years: 94.1 versus 91.8 % at 144 weeks (3 years) after the second year (week 96) and 90.8 versus 90.4 % at the fifth year (week 240). The overall survival rate was 100 % for both groups during the third through fifth year study period. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events (AEs) between the 2 groups: most AEs were rated grade 1 or 2.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adjuvant leuprorelin treatment for 3 or more years with tamoxifen showed a survival benefit and safety profile similar to that for 2 years in premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. No new safety signal was identified for long-term leuprorelin treatment. Longer follow-up observation is needed to determine the optimal duration of leuprorelin treatment.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer arising at a young age is relatively uncommon, particularly in the developed world. Several studies have demonstrated that younger patients often experience a more aggressive disease course and have poorer outcome compared to older women. Expression of key biomarkers, including endocrine receptors, HER2 and proliferation markers, appears to be different in younger patients and young women are more likely to harbor a genetic predisposition. Despite these differences, little research to date has focused on the biology of these tumors to refine prognosis, and potentially direct treatment strategies, which remain similar to those offered to older patients. Accumulating evidence suggests the differences in breast stroma in younger patients and changes that occur with pregnancy and breastfeeding likely contribute to the different biology of these tumors. Reproductive behaviors appear to impact the biology of tumors developing later in life. In addition, tumors arising during or shortly following pregnancy appear to exhibit unique biological features. In this review, we discuss our emerging understanding of the biology of breast cancer arising at a young age at both the pathologic and the genomic level. We elucidate the potential role of genomic signatures, the impact of pregnancy and breastfeeding on breast cancer biology, and how even current knowledge might advance the clinical management of young breast cancer patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Zoledronic acid (ZOL) plus adjuvant endocrine therapy significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) at 48- and 62-month follow-up in the ABCSG-12 trial. We present efficacy results of a final additional analysis after 94.4 months.",
        "Methods": "Patients were premenopausal women who had undergone primary surgery for stage I/II estrogen-receptor-positive and/or progesterone-receptor-positive breast cancer with <10 positive lymph nodes, and were scheduled for standard goserelin therapy. All 1803 patients received goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days) and were randomized to tamoxifen (20 mg/days) or anastrozole (1 mg/days), both with or without ZOL (4 mg every 6 months) for 3 years. The primary end point was DFS; recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) were secondary end points.",
        "Results/Findings": "After 94.4-month median follow-up (range, 0-114 months), relative risks of disease progression [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.99; P = 0.042] and of death (HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.43-1.02; P = 0.064) are still reduced by ZOL although no longer significant at the predefined significance level. Overall, 251 DFS events and 86 deaths were reported. Absolute risk reductions with ZOL were 3.4% for DFS and 2.2% for OS. There was no DFS difference between tamoxifen alone versus anastrozole alone, but there was a pronounced higher risk of death for anastrozole-treated patients (HR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.05-1.45; P = 0.030). Treatments were generally well tolerated, with no reports of renal failure or osteonecrosis of the jaw.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Sexual dysfunction is a known complication of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and an important determinant of quality of life. However, few studies have explored how treatment and other factors affect sexual functioning in young breast cancer survivors.",
        "Methods": "Four hundred sixty-one premenopausal women with stage 0 through III breast cancer were surveyed an average of 1 year after diagnosis as part of a prospective cohort study of women who were aged ≤40 years at diagnosis. Sexual interest and dysfunction were assessed using the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES). Mean CARES scores were compared and multiple regression models were fit to assess treatment and a range of menopausal and somatic symptoms in relation to sexual functioning.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mean CARES sexual interest and dysfunction scores were both highest (indicating poorer functioning) among women who received chemotherapy and were amenorrheic from treatment. After accounting for menopausal and somatic symptoms, treatment-associated amenorrhea remained associated with decreased interest but was no longer an independent predictor of dysfunction. In the multivariable analysis, independent predictors of dysfunction included vaginal pain symptoms, poorer body image, and fatigue. Sexual interest was associated with vaginal pain symptoms, body image, and weight problems.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Factors associated with decreased sexual functioning in young breast cancer survivors can often be ameliorated. The current findings have implications for premenopausal women with other types of cancer who might be experiencing amenorrhea because of chemotherapy or surgery. Increased awareness and early intervention is essential to help improve sexual functioning and associated quality of life for all young cancer survivors.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Randomised trials of tamoxifen versus placebo indicate that tamoxifen reduces breast cancer risk by approximately 33%, yet uptake is low. Approximately 10% of women in our clinic entered the IBIS-I prevention trial. We assess the uptake of tamoxifen in a consecutive series of premenopausal women not in a trial and explore the reasons for uptake through interviews.",
        "Methods": "All eligible women between 33 and 46 years at ≥17% lifetime risk of breast cancer and undergoing annual mammography in our service were invited to take a 5-year course of tamoxifen. Reasons for accepting (n=15) or declining (n=15) were explored using semi-structured interviews.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1279 eligible women, 136 (10.6%) decided to take tamoxifen. Women >40 years (74 out of 553 (13.4%)) and those at higher non-BRCA-associated risk were more likely to accept tamoxifen (129 out of 1109 (11.6%)). Interviews highlighted four themes surrounding decision making: perceived impact of side effects, the impact of others' experience on beliefs about tamoxifen, tamoxifen as a 'cancer drug', and daily reminder of cancer risk.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tamoxifen uptake was similar to previously ascertained uptake in a randomised controlled trial (IBIS-I). Concerns were similar in women who did or did not accept tamoxifen. Decision making appeared to be embedded in the experience of significant others.",

        "Methods": "Between 2000 and 2008, 2956 patients aged 40 years or younger were recruited to a UK multicenter prospective observational cohort study (POSH). Details of tumor pathology, disease stage, treatment received, and outcome were recorded. Overall survival (OS) and distant disease-free interval (DDFI) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median age of patients was 36 years. Median tumor diameter was 22 mm, and 50% of patients had positive lymph nodes; 59% of tumors were grade 3, 33.7% were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and 24% were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive. Five-year OS was higher for patients with ER-positive than ER-negative tumors (85.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.2% to 86.7% vs 75.7%, 95% CI = 72.8% to 78.4%; P < .001), but by eight years, survival was almost equal. The eight-year OS of patients with ER-positive tumors was similar to that of patients with ER-negative tumors in both HER2-positive and HER2-negative subgroups. The flexible parametric survival model for OS shows that the risk of death increases steadily over time for patients with ER-positive tumors in contrast to patients with ER-negative tumors, where risk of death peaked at two years.",

        "Background/Purpose": "For women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer, treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years substantially reduces the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the first 15 years after diagnosis. We aimed to assess the further effects of continuing tamoxifen to 10 years instead of stopping at 5 years.",
        "Methods": "In the worldwide Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial, 12,894 women with early breast cancer who had completed 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomly allocated to continue tamoxifen to 10 years or stop at 5 years (open control). Allocation (1:1) was by central computer, using minimisation. After entry (between 1996 and 2005), yearly follow-up forms recorded any recurrence, second cancer, hospital admission, or death. We report effects on breast cancer outcomes among the 6846 women with ER-positive disease, and side-effects among all women (with positive, negative, or unknown ER status). Long-term follow-up still continues. This study is registered, number ISRCTN19652633.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among women with ER-positive disease, allocation to continue tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences in 3428 women allocated to continue vs 711 in 3418 controls, p=0·002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths vs 397 deaths, p=0·01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths vs 722 deaths, p=0·01). The reductions in adverse breast cancer outcomes appeared to be less extreme before than after year 10 (recurrence rate ratio [RR] 0·90 [95% CI 0·79–1·02] during years 5–9 and 0·75 [0·62–0·90] in later years; breast cancer mortality RR 0·97 [0·79–1·18] during years 5–9 and 0·71 [0·58–0·88] in later years). The cumulative risk of recurrence during years 5–14 was 21·4% for women allocated to continue versus 25·1% for controls; breast cancer mortality during years 5–14 was 12·2% for women allocated to continue versus 15·0% for controls (absolute mortality reduction 2·8%). Treatment allocation seemed to have no effect on breast cancer outcome among 1248 women with ER-negative disease, and an intermediate effect among 4800 women with unknown ER status. Among all 12,894 women, mortality without recurrence from causes other than breast cancer was little affected (691 deaths without recurrence in 6454 women allocated to continue versus 679 deaths in 6440 controls; RR 0·99 [0·89–1·10]; p=0·84). For the incidence (hospitalisation or death) rates of specific diseases, RRs were as follows: pulmonary embolus 1·87 (95% CI 1·13–3·07, p=0·01 [including 0·2% mortality in both treatment groups]), stroke 1·06 (0·83–1·36), ischaemic heart disease 0·76 (0·60–0·95, p=0·02), and endometrial cancer 1·74 (1·30–2·34, p=0·0002). The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5–14 was 3·1% (mortality 0·4%) for women allocated to continue versus 1·6% (mortality 0·2%) for controls (absolute mortality increase 0·2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For women with ER-positive disease, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than stopping at 5 years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality, particularly after year 10. These results, taken together with results from previous trials of 5 years of tamoxifen treatment versus none, suggest that 10 years of tamoxifen treatment can approximately halve breast cancer mortality during the second decade after diagnosis.",

In 2011, EUSOMA identified the management of young women with breast cancer as one of the hot topics for which a consensus among European experts was needed. Therefore, the society recently organised a workshop to define such recommendations. Thirteen experts from the different disciplines met for two days to discuss the topic. This international and multidisciplinary panel thoroughly reviewed the literature in order to prepare evidence-based recommendations. During the meeting, two working groups were set up to discuss in detail diagnosis and loco-regional and systemic treatments, including both group aspects of psychology and sexuality. The conclusions reached by the working groups were then discussed in a plenary session to reach panel consensus. Whenever possible, a measure of the level of evidence (LoE) from 1 (the highest) to 4 (the lowest) degree, based on the methodology proposed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), was assigned to each recommendation. The present manuscript presents the recommendations of this consensus group for the management of young women with breast cancer in daily clinical practice.",

        "Methods": "We undertook individual-patient-data meta-analyses of the randomised trials comparing: any taxane-plus-anthracycline-based regimen versus the same, or more, non-taxane chemotherapy (n=44,000); one anthracycline-based regimen versus another (n=7000) or versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; n=18,000); and polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (n=32,000). The scheduled dosages of these three drugs and of the anthracyclines doxorubicin (A) and epirubicin (E) were used to define standard CMF, standard 4AC, and CAF and CEF. Log-rank breast cancer mortality rate ratios (RRs) are reported.",
        "Results/Findings": "In trials adding four separate cycles of a taxane to a fixed anthracycline-based control regimen, extending treatment duration, breast cancer mortality was reduced (RR 0·86, SE 0·04, two-sided significance [2p]=0·0005). In trials with four such extra cycles of a taxane counterbalanced in controls by extra cycles of other cytotoxic drugs, roughly doubling non-taxane dosage, there was no significant difference (RR 0·94, SE 0·06, 2p=0·33). Trials with CMF-treated controls showed that standard 4AC and standard CMF were equivalent (RR 0·98, SE 0·05, 2p=0·67), but that anthracycline-based regimens with substantially higher cumulative dosage than standard 4AC (eg, CAF or CEF) were superior to standard CMF (RR 0·78, SE 0·06, 2p=0·0004). Trials versus no chemotherapy also suggested greater mortality reductions with CAF (RR 0·64, SE 0·09, 2p<0·0001) than with standard 4AC (RR 0·78, SE 0·09, 2p=0·01) or standard CMF (RR 0·76, SE 0·05, 2p<0·0001). In all meta-analyses involving taxane-based or anthracycline-based regimens, proportional risk reductions were little affected by age, nodal status, tumour diameter or differentiation (moderate or poor; few were well differentiated), oestrogen receptor status, or tamoxifen use. Hence, largely independently of age (up to at least 70 years) or the tumour characteristics currently available to us for the patients selected to be in these trials, some taxane-plus-anthracycline-based or higher-cumulative-dosage anthracycline-based regimens (not requiring stem cells) reduced breast cancer mortality by, on average, about one-third. 10-year overall mortality differences paralleled breast cancer mortality differences, despite taxane, anthracycline, and other toxicities.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "10-year gains from a one-third breast cancer mortality reduction depend on absolute risks without chemotherapy (which, for oestrogen-receptor-positive disease, are the risks remaining with appropriate endocrine therapy). Low absolute risk implies low absolute benefit, but information was lacking about tumour gene expression markers or quantitative immunohistochemistry that might help to predict risk, chemosensitivity, or both.",

Preclinical data suggested that p53 mutations conferred enhanced radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and the few clinical observations showed that Li-Fraumeni families were at a higher risk of secondary radio-induced malignancies.",

        "Results/Findings": "Among 47 documented Li-Fraumeni families treated from 1997 to 2007 at the Institut Gustave Roussy, 8 patients had been diagnosed with breast cancer as the first tumor event. Three patients had undergone conservative breast surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy and five patients had undergone a mastectomy (3 with postoperative radiotherapy). Thus, 6/8 patients had received postoperative radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 6 years. Median age at the diagnosis of the primary breast cancer was 30 years. The histological characteristics were as follows: intraductal carcinoma in situ (n = 3), invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 4) and a phyllodes tumor (n = 1). Among the 6 patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy, the following events had occurred: 3 ipsilateral breast recurrences, 3 contralateral breast cancers, 2 radio-induced cancers, and 3 new primaries (1 of which was an in-field thyroid cancer with atypical histology). In contrast, only one event had occurred (a contralateral breast cancer) among patients who had not received radiation therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite the benefit of adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) on mortality among women with breast cancer (BC), many women are non-adherent with its use. We investigated the effects of early discontinuation and non-adherence to HT on mortality in women enrolled in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC). We identified women diagnosed with hormone-sensitive stage I-III BC, 1996-2007, and used automated pharmacy records to identify prescriptions and dates of refill. We categorized patients as having discontinued HT early if 180 days elapsed from the prior prescription. For those who continued, we categorized patients as adherent if the medication possession ratio was ≥80%. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between discontinuation and non-adherence with all-cause mortality. Among 8,769 women who filled at least one prescription for HT, 2,761 (31%) discontinued therapy. Of those who continued HT, 1,684 (28%) were non-adherent. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 813 women died. Estimated survival at 10 years was 80.7% for women who continued HT versus 73.6% for those who discontinued (P < 0.001). Of those who continued, survival at 10 years was 81.7 and 77.8% in women who adhered and non-adhered, respectively (P < 0.001). Adjusting for clinical and demographic variables, both early discontinuation (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.46) and non-adherence (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81), among those who continued, were independent predictors of mortality. Both early discontinuation and non-adherence to HT were common and associated with increased mortality. Interventions to improve continuation of and adherence to HT may be critical to improve BC survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, were issued in October 2000. The guidelines recommend that to minimize transmission of community respiratory virus (CRV) infection, health care workers and visitors with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection be restricted from having contact with HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy. To screen HSCT recipients for CRVs, active clinical surveillance for CRV disease should be conducted on all hospitalized HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy, including daily monitoring for signs and symptoms of CRV infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important CRV because it is the most prevalent and because RSV pneumonia has a high case-fatality rate. For this reason, it is recommended that respiratory secretions of any hospitalized HSCT candidate or recipient with signs and symptoms of CRV infection be tested promptly for RSV. If test results are positive, the patient should be treated early and aggressively. Early preemptive therapy with such treatments as aerosolized ribavirin has been proposed, but limited data preclude a recommendation as to the optimal strategy. Lifelong seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all HSCT recipients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite overall improvements in cancer survival due to earlier diagnosis and better treatment, socio-economically disadvantaged people have lower cancer survival than more advantaged people. We aimed to examine differences in cancer survival by area-level socio-economic disadvantage in Victoria, Australia and assess whether these inequalities varied by year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis and sex. Cases diagnosed with a first primary cancer in 2001–2015 were identified using the Victorian Cancer Registry and followed to the end of 2016. Five-year net survival and the excess risk of death due to a cancer diagnosis were estimated. People living in more disadvantaged areas had lower five-year survival than residents of less disadvantaged regions for 21 of 29 cancer types: head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, anus/anal canal, liver, gallbladder/biliary tract, pancreas, lung, melanoma, connective/soft tissue, female breast, ovary, prostate, kidney, bladder, brain and central nervous system, unknown primary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukemia. The observed lower survival in more deprived regions persisted over time, except head and neck cancer, for which the gap in survival has widened. Socio-economic inequalities in survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis for cancers of connective/soft tissue, bladder and unknown primary. For colorectal cancer, the observed survival disadvantage in lower socio-economic regions was greater for men than for women, while for brain and central nervous system tumours, it was larger for women. Cancer survival is generally lower for residents of more socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Identifying the underlying reasons for these inequalities is important and may help to identify effective interventions to increase survival for underprivileged cancer patients.",

The inverse associations were observed even among nonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest and lowest BMI categories (BMI≥35.0 vs <17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or between strata of other breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger for estrogen receptor–positive and/or progesterone receptor–positive than for hormone receptor–negative breast cancer for BMI at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18 to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen receptor–positive and progesterone receptor–positive tumors, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs hormone receptor–negative tumors, 0.85 [95% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 years was not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor–negative breast cancer overall.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results of this study suggest that increased adiposity is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at a greater magnitude than previously shown and across the entire distribution of BMI. The strongest associations of risk were observed for BMI in early adulthood. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations could have important preventive potential.",

Durvalumab increased the pathological complete response (pCR) rate particularly in patients treated with durvalumab alone before start of chemotherapy (Loibl et al. Ann Oncol 2019).",
        "Methods": "GeparNuevo randomized patients with cT1b-cT4a-d tumors and centrally confirmed TNBC to durvalumab (D) 1.5 g i.v. or placebo every 4 weeks. D/placebo monotherapy (0.75 g i.v.) was given for the first 2 weeks (window phase), followed by D/placebo plus nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m² weekly for 12 weeks, followed by D/placebo plus epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) q2 weeks for 4 cycles. Randomization was stratified by stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) (low (≤10%), intermediate (11-59%), high (≥60%)). The primary objective was pCR (ypT0 ypN0). Secondary time-to-event endpoints included invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS).",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 174 patients were enrolled between June 2016 and September 2017. The pCR rate with durvalumab was 53.4% versus placebo 44.2% (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.80–2.63, unadjusted Wald p = 0.224). Durvalumab effect was seen only in the window cohort (pCR 61.0% versus 41.4%, OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.06–4.64, p = 0.035; interaction p = 0.048). After a median follow-up of 42.2 months, 34 events occurred in 174 patients. 3-year iDFS in pCR vs non pCR was 92.0% vs 71.9% (log-rank p = 0.002). 3-year iDFS was 84.9% with durvalumab vs 76.9% with placebo (HR 0.54, 95%CI 0.27-1.09, stratified log-rank p = 0.0559); 3-year DDFS 91.4% vs 79.5% (HR 0.37, 95%CI 0.15-0.87, p = 0.0148); 3-year OS 95.1% vs 83.1% (HR 0.26, 95%CI 0.09-0.79, p = 0.0076). No difference was seen in iDFS, DDFS and OS between the window and no window cohort.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Durvalumab added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC significantly improved long-term outcome despite a small pCR increase and no continuation after surgery. It needs to be questioned whether adjuvant therapy with CPI is needed at all.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Adjuvant zoledronate is widely used in patients with early stage breast cancer (EBC), but its optimal duration and dosing interval is still unknown. While a single-dose of zoledronate can improve bone density for many years, a proper evaluation of its effects on breast cancer-related outcomes would require a large trial. In this pilot study we evaluated the feasibility of performing such a trial.",
        "Methods": "Eligible patients with EBC were randomised to receive either one dose of zoledronate or 7 doses (6-monthly dosing for 3 years). Feasibility was assessed by a combination of primary outcomes including: activation of at least 6 Ontario sites within a year, active participation (i.e. approaching eligible patients for study participation) of at least half of the medical oncologists, and enrolment of at least 100 patients across all sites within 9 months of the sixth site being activated.",
        "Results/Findings": "All 6 sites were activated within 1 year and of 47 medical oncologists, 27 (57%) approached patients. Between November 2018 and April 2020, 211 eligible patients were randomised, 106 (50.2%) to a single dose of zoledronate and 105 (49.8%) to 6-monthly dosing. Baseline characteristics of randomised patients included; median age 59 (range 36–88), ER and/or PR positive (85%), Her2 positive (23%), menopausal status (premenopausal [19%], perimenopausal [6.7%] and postmenopausal [74%]) and 74% received neo/adjuvant chemotherapy.&#10;",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "All study feasibility endpoints were met in this trial comparing alternative schedules for adjuvant zoledronate. We will now seek funding for performing a larger efficacy trial.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Women diagnosed with breast cancer at young age often have poorprognoses. Yet, few studies have focused on the prognoses of young men with breast cancer. We therefore used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based data and identified 151 male patients with breast cancer aged <40 years between 1988 and 2012. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the clinical variables among different groups. Kaplan–Meier curves were applied to compare the survival differences. The subgroup variables on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results showed that male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had a significant OS benefit compared with those aged ≥40 years (P < .001). The significant difference of the CSS was not found (P > .05). Compared with the male patients with breast cancer aged ≥40, those aged <40 had significant OS benefit in most subgroups (P < .05). Compared with the female patients with breast cancer aged <40, the male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had worse OS and CSS benefit only in the subgroup with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor positive (P < .05). In conclusion, we demonstrated that young male patients with breast cancer had better OS compared with elder male patients with breast cancer. However, the survival benefit was not found compared with young female patients with breast cancer.",
