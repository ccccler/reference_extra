        "Background/Purpose": "Zoledronic acid reduces skeletal-related events in patients with breast cancer, but concerns have been raised about prolonged monthly administration. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a reduced dosing frequency of zoledronic acid in women treated previously with monthly zoledronic acid.",
        "Methods": "We did this non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 62 centres in Italy. We enrolled patients with breast cancer who had one or more bone metastases and had completed 12-15 months of monthly treatment with zoledronic acid. Patients were randomly assigned with a permutated block (size four to eight) random list stratified by centre in a 1:1 ratio to zoledronic acid 4 mg once every 12 weeks or once every 4 weeks, and followed up for at least 1 year. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was skeletal morbidity rate (skeletal-related events per patient per year) in the intention-to-treat population. We used a non-inferiority margin of 0.19. The trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2005-004942-15.",
        "Results/Findings": "We screened 430 patients and enrolled 425, of whom 209 were assigned to the 12-week group and 216 to the 4-week group. The skeletal morbidity rate was 0.26 (95% CI 0.15-0.37) in the 12-week group versus 0.22 (0.14-0.29) in the 4-week group. The between-group difference was 0.04 and the upper limit of one-tailed 97.5% CI was 0.17, which is lower than the non-inferiority margin. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were bone pain (56 [27%] patients in the 12-week group vs 65 [30%] in the 4-week group), nausea (24 [11%] vs 33 [15%]), and asthenia (18 [9%] vs 33 [15%]). Renal adverse events occurred in one patient (<1%) in the 12-week group versus two (1%) in the 4-week group. One patient (<1%) in the 4-week group had grade 1 acute renal failure. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in four patients in the 12-week group versus three in the 4-week group. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Median N-terminal telopeptide concentration changed from baseline more in the 12-week group than in the 4-week group after 12 months (12.2% vs 0.0%; p=0.011).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results raise the possibility of decreasing administration of zoledronic acid to a 12-weekly regimen to reduce exposure during the second year, while maintaining its therapeutic effects. However, the effects on N-terminal telopeptide should be investigated further before changing current practice.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Young women have worse outcome following breast-conserving therapy (BCT) than do older patients in many studies. We examined how clinical, pathological, and treatment factors affect these results.",
        "Methods": "Between 1993 and 1999, 130 patients age 40 years or younger with stage I or II breast cancer were treated with BCT. The median radiation dose to the tumor bed was 61 Gy; 80% of patients received chemotherapy; and 29% of 72 patients with estrogen-receptor positive tumors received tamoxifen. Median follow-up was 93 months.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fifteen patients (12%) developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), with or without other simultaneous failure sites. The Kaplan-Meier 5- and 8-year actuarial rates were 8% and 14%, respectively. The 74 patients with grade 3 tumors had a higher IBTR rate (8-year actuarial rate, 18%) than the 54 patients with grade 1-2 lesions (7%) (P = 0.09). Six patients developed contralateral breast cancers, and 17 developed distant metastases (DM). The 8-year actuarial rates for freedom-from-DM, relapse-free survival, and overall survival were 85%, 72% and 96%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This represents one of the largest series of young women treated with BCT, using an approach similar to current practice. The IBTR rate was substantially lower than in many past studies, but still higher than would be expected for older women. This appeared largely due to the increased rate of IBTR in patients with grade 3 tumors. If this observation is confirmed, further analysis of this subgroup may lead to ways of reducing the risk of IBTR.",

This qualitative research study explores the fertility and parenthood concerns of reproductive-age female cancer survivors and how they make parenthood decisions.",
        "Methods": "Population- and clinic-based recruitment methods were used to identify a diverse group of survivors between the ages of 18 and 34 years. Our final sample size included 22 participants who attended one of seven focus groups. We used cross-case, inductive analysis to identify themes.",
        "Results/Findings": "The following main themes were identified: (1) A hopeful but worried approach to fertility and parenthood, (2) Frustration with a lack of choice or control over fertility, (3) Young survivors want information about their fertility, (4) Young survivors want better continuity of care in survivorship, (5) Cancer diagnosis and related fertility problems introduce relationship challenges, and (6) Decisions about parenthood are complicated.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The diverse group of young cancer survivors in this study identified several common needs and concerns regarding fertility and parenthood. This study illustrates that young survivors could benefit from improved information regarding their fertility and parenthood options throughout survivorship, better coordination of medical care, and support navigating many emotional and practical issues that arise when considering their reproductive and parenthood options.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Women with metastatic breast cancer and an intact primary tumor are currently treated with systemic therapy. Local therapy of the primary tumor is considered irrelevant to the outcome, and is recommended only for palliation of symptoms.",
        "Methods": "We have examined the use of local therapy, and its impact on survival in patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer at initial diagnosis, who were reported to the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between 1990 and 1993.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 16,023 patients with stage IV disease were identified in the NCDB during this period, of whom 6861 (42.8%) received either no operation or a variety of diagnostic or palliative procedures, and 9162 (57.2%) underwent partial (3513) or total (5649) mastectomy. The presence of free surgical margins was associated with an improvement in 3-year survival in partial or total mastectomy groups (26% vs 35%, respectively). A multivariate proportional hazards model identified the number of metastatic sites, the type of metastatic burden, and the extent of resection of the primary tumor as significant independent prognostic covariates. Women treated with surgical resection with free margins, when compared with those not surgically treated, had superior prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.58,0.65).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data suggest that the role of local therapy in women with stage IV breast cancer needs to be re-evaluated, and local therapy plus systemic therapy should be compared with systemic therapy alone in a randomized trial.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage breast cancer decreases ipsilateral breast-tumour recurrence (IBTR), yielding comparable results to mastectomy. It is unknown whether accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) to only the tumour-bearing quadrant, which shortens treatment duration, is equally effective. In our trial, we investigated whether APBI provides equivalent local tumour control after lumpectomy compared with whole-breast irradiation.",
        "Methods": "We did this randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) in 154 clinical centres in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and Israel. Adult women (>18 years) with early-stage (0, I, or II; no evidence of distant metastases, but up to three axillary nodes could be positive) breast cancer (tumour size ≤3 cm; including all histologies and multifocal breast cancers), who had had lumpectomy with negative (ie, no detectable cancer cells) surgical margins, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a biased-coin-based minimisation algorithm to receive either whole-breast irradiation (whole-breast irradiation group) or APBI (APBI group). Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38·5 Gy of external bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period. Randomisation was stratified by disease stage, menopausal status, hormone-receptor status, and intention to receive chemotherapy. Patients, investigators, and statisticians could not be masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome of invasive and non-invasive IBTR as a first recurrence was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, excluding those patients who were lost to follow-up, with an equivalency test on the basis of a 50% margin increase in the hazard ratio (90% CI for the observed HR between 0·667 and 1·5 for equivalence) and a Cox proportional hazard model. Survival was assessed by intention to treat, and sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between March 21, 2005, and April 16, 2013, 4216 women were enrolled. 2109 were assigned to the whole-breast irradiation group and 2107 were assigned to the APBI group. 70 patients from the whole-breast irradiation group and 14 from the APBI group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up at this stage, so 2039 and 2093 patients respectively were available for survival analysis. Further, three and four patients respectively were lost to clinical follow-up (ie, survival status was assessed by phone but no physical examination was done), leaving 2036 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in the APBI group evaluable for the primary outcome. At a median follow-up of 10·2 years (IQR 7·5-11·5), 90 (4%) of 2089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an IBTR (HR 1·22, 90% CI 0·94-1·58). The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 4·6% (95% CI 3·7-5·7) in the APBI group versus 3·9% (3·1-5·0) in the whole-breast irradiation group. 44 (2%) of 2039 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 49 (2%) of 2093 patients in the APBI group died from recurring breast cancer. There were no treatment-related deaths. Second cancers and treatment-related toxicities were similar between the two groups. 2020 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in APBI group had available data on adverse events. The highest toxicity grade reported was: grade 1 in 845 (40%), grade 2 in 921 (44%), and grade 3 in 201 (10%) patients in the APBI group, compared with grade 1 in 626 (31%), grade 2 in 1193 (59%), and grade 3 in 143 (7%) in the whole-breast irradiation group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "APBI did not meet the criteria for equivalence to whole-breast irradiation in controlling IBTR for breast-conserving therapy. Our trial had broad eligibility criteria, leading to a large, heterogeneous pool of patients and sufficient power to detect treatment equivalence, but was not designed to test equivalence in patient subgroups or outcomes from different APBI techniques. For patients with early-stage breast cancer, our findings support whole-breast irradiation following lumpectomy; however, with an absolute difference of less than 1% in the 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR, APBI might be an acceptable alternative for some women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Whole breast irradiation delivered once per day over 3-5 weeks after breast conserving surgery reduces local recurrence with good cosmetic results. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered over 1 week to the tumour bed was developed to provide a more convenient treatment. In this trial, we investigated if external beam APBI was non-inferior to whole breast irradiation.",
        "Methods": "We did this multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial in 33 cancer centres in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Women aged 40 years or older with ductal carcinoma in situ or node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either external beam APBI (38·5 Gy in ten fractions delivered twice per day over 5-8 days) or whole breast irradiation (42·5 Gy in 16 fractions once per day over 21 days, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions once per day over 35 days). Patients and clinicans were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR), analysed by intention to treat. The trial was designed on the basis of an expected 5 year IBTR rate of 1·5% in the whole breast irradiation group with 85% power to exclude a 1·5% increase in the APBI group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the IBTR hazard ratio (HR) was less than 2·02. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 7, 2006, and July 15, 2011, we enrolled 2135 women. 1070 were randomly assigned to receive APBI and 1065 were assigned to receive whole breast irradiation. Six patients in the APBI group withdrew before treatment, four more did not receive radiotherapy, and 16 patients received whole breast irradiation. In the whole breast irradiation group, 16 patients withdrew, and two more did not receive radiotherapy. In the APBI group, a further 14 patients were lost to follow-up and nine patients withdrew during the follow-up period. In the whole breast irradiation group, 20 patients were lost to follow-up and 35 withdrew during follow-up. Median follow-up was 8·6 years (IQR 7·3-9·9). The 8-year cumulative rates of IBTR were 3·0% (95% CI 1·9-4·0) in the APBI group and 2·8% (1·8-3·9) in the whole breast irradiation group. The HR for APBI versus whole breast radiation was 1·27 (90% CI 0·84-1·91). Acute radiation toxicity (grade ≥2, within 3 months of radiotherapy start) occurred less frequently in patients treated with APBI (300 [28%] of 1070 patients) than whole breast irradiation (484 [45%] of 1065 patients, p<0·0001). Late radiation toxicity (grade ≥2, later than 3 months) was more common in patients treated with APBI (346 [32%] of 1070 patients) than whole breast irradiation (142 [13%] of 1065 patients; p<0·0001). Adverse cosmesis (defined as fair or poor) was more common in patients treated with APBI than in those treated by whole breast irradiation at 3 years (absolute difference, 11·3%, 95% CI 7·5-15·0), 5 years (16·5%, 12·5-20·4), and 7 years (17·7%, 12·9-22·3).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "External beam APBI was non-inferior to whole breast irradiation in preventing IBTR. Although less acute toxicity was observed, the regimen used was associated with an increase in moderate late toxicity and adverse cosmesis, which might be related to the twice per day treatment. Other approaches, such as treatment once per day, might not adversely affect cosmesis and should be studied.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We used immunohistochemical analysis to detect the presence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR) protein expression in the epithelial and stromal cells of 143 phyllodes tumors (PTs). Expression of epithelial ER and PR proteins was common, occurring in 43% to 84% of PTs. Expression of epithelial AR protein and stromal ER, PR, and AR proteins was low (5% or less) in all tumors. An inverse relationship of epithelial ER and PR protein expression with degree of malignancy in PT was found (P < .05), and ER expression also correlated with mitotic count (P < .05). When considering PT with the expression of ER or PR proteins and the coexpression of both, the inverse relationship with tumor grade also was significant (P < .05). As the hormonal receptor protein expression shows a consistent decrease with increasing malignancy, we infer that the epithelium has a crucial role in the pathogenesis or progression of PT.",

The study protocol stipulated radical surgery but microscopically clear margins were not mandatory. We randomised 1,046 operated women to postoperative RT or control between 1987 and 1999. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local recurrence. Secondary endpoints were contralateral breast cancer, distant metastasis and death. After a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range 0.1-13.8) there were 44 recurrences in the RT group corresponding to a cumulative incidence of 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.10). In the control group there were 117 recurrences giving a cumulative incidence of 0.22 (95% CI 0.18-0.26) giving an overall hazard ratio of 0.33 (95% CI 0.24-0.47, p < 0.0001). Twenty two percent of the patients had microscopically unknown or involved margins. We found no evidence for different effects of RT on the relative risk of invasive or in situ recurrence. Secondary endpoints did not differ. Women undergoing sector resection for DCIS under conditions of population based screening mammography benefit from postoperative RT to the breast. Seven patients needed RT-treatment to prevent one recurrence.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We sought the extent to which arm morbidity could be reduced by using sentinel-lymph-node-based management in women with clinically node-negative early breast cancer. One thousand eighty-eight women were randomly allocated to sentinel-lymph-node biopsy followed by axillary clearance if the sentinel node was positive or not detected (SNBM) or routine axillary clearance (RAC, sentinel-lymph-node biopsy followed immediately by axillary clearance). Sentinel nodes were located using blue dye, alone or with technetium-labeled antimony sulfide colloid. The primary endpoint was increase in arm volume from baseline to the average of measurements at 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints were the proportions of women with at least 15% increase in arm volume or early axillary morbidity, and average scores for arm symptoms, dysfunctions, and disabilities assessed at 6 and 12 months by patients with the SNAC Study-Specific Scales and other quality-of-life instruments. Sensitivity, false-negative rates, and negative predictive values for sentinel-lymph-node biopsy were estimated in the RAC group. The average increase in arm volume was 2.8% in the SNBM group and 4.2% in the RAC group (P = 0.002). Patients in the SNBM group gave lower ratings for arm swelling (P < 0.001), symptoms (P < 0.001), and dysfunctions (P = 0.02), but not disabilities (P = 0.5). Sentinel nodes were found in 95% of the SNBM group (29% positive) and 93% of the RAC group (25% positive). SNB had sensitivity 94.5%, false-negative rate 5.5%, and negative predictive value 98%. SNBM was successfully undertaken in a wide range of surgical centers and caused significantly less morbidity than RAC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We reviewed our institution's experience treating early-stage breast cancer patients with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) to determine the impact of boost technique on outcome. A total of 552 patients with stage I and II breast cancer were managed with BCT. All patients were treated with a partial mastectomy and radiation therapy (RT). RT consisted of 45 Gy to 50 Gy external beam irradiation to the whole breast followed by a boost to the tumor bed using either electrons (232 patients), photons (15 patients), or an interstitial implant (316 patients). Local control and cosmetic outcome was compared among three patient groups based on the type of boost used. Forty-one patients had a recurrence of cancer in the treated breast for 5-, 10-, and 13-year actuarial local recurrence rates of 2.8%, 7.5%, and 11.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the local recurrence rates or cosmetic outcome using electrons, photons, or an interstitial implant. On multivariate analysis, only young age and margin status were associated with local recurrence. Stage I and II breast cancer patients undergoing BCT can be effectively managed with electron, photon, or interstitial implant boost techniques. Long-term local control and cosmetic outcome are excellent regardless of which boost technique is used.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We report the case of a woman who conceived while being treated on a phase I clinical trial with lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2/neu, for metastatic breast cancer. Despite approximately 11 weeks of exposure to lapatinib in the first and second trimesters, the pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the delivery of a healthy baby. Although concomitant cancer and pregnancy is relatively rare, the increasing use of biologic agents among fertile women, sometimes for as long as a year in the adjuvant setting increases the probability that some women will conceive while taking a growth factor pathway inhibitor. As with systemic chemotherapy given during pregnancy, there exists the potential for teratogenicity or fetal demise from exposure of the developing embryo to inhibitors of EGFR and HER2/neu. Despite the positive outcome of this case, continued caution is warranted with the use of EGFR and HER2/neu inhibitors in pregnancy.",

We now report final survival outcomes.",
        "Methods": "We randomly assigned patients to receive either anastrozole or fulvestrant plus anastrozole. Randomization was stratified according to adjuvant tamoxifen use. Analysis of survival was performed by means of two-sided stratified log-rank tests and Cox regression. Efficacy and safety were compared between the two groups, both overall and in subgroups.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 707 patients who had undergone randomization, 694 had data available for analysis. The combination-therapy group had 247 deaths among 349 women (71%) and a median overall survival of 49.8 months, as compared with 261 deaths among 345 women (76%) and a median overall survival of 42.0 months in the anastrozole-alone group, a significant difference (hazard ratio for death, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.98; P = 0.03 by the log-rank test). In a subgroup analysis of the two strata, overall survival among women who had not received tamoxifen previously was longer with the combination therapy than with anastrozole alone (median, 52.2 months and 40.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.92); among women who had received tamoxifen previously, overall survival was similar in the two groups (median, 48.2 months and 43.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.27) (P = 0.09 for interaction). The incidence of long-term toxic effects of grade 3 to 5 was similar in the two groups. Approximately 45% of the patients in the anastrozole-alone group crossed over to receive fulvestrant.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of fulvestrant to anastrozole was associated with increased long-term survival as compared with anastrozole alone, despite substantial crossover to fulvestrant after progression during therapy with anastrozole alone. The results suggest that the benefit was particularly notable in patients without previous exposure to adjuvant endocrine therapy.

        "Background/Purpose": "We have shown that testosterone (T) deficiency per se is associated with marked catabolic effects on protein, calcium metabolism, and body composition in men independent of changes in GH or insulin-like growth factor I production. It is not clear,,however, whether estrogens have a major role in whole body anabolism in males. We investigated the metabolic effects of selective estrogen suppression in the male using a potent aromatase inhibitor, Arimidex (Anastrozole). First, a dose-response study of 12 males (mean age, 16.1 +/- 0.3 yr) was conducted, and blood withdrawn at baseline and after 10 days of oral Arimidex given as two different doses (either 0.5 or 1 mg) in random order with a 14-day washout in between. A sensitive estradiol (E2) assay showed an approximately 50% decrease in E2 concentrations with either of the two doses; hence, a 1-mg dose was selected for other studies. Subsequently, eight males (aged 15-22 yr; four adults and four late pubertal) had isotopic infusions of [(13)C]leucine and (42)Ca/(44)Ca, indirect calorimetry, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, isokinetic dynamometry, and growth factors measurements performed before and after 10 weeks of daily doses of Arimidex. Contrary to the effects of T withdrawal, there were no significant changes in body composition (body mass index, fat mass, and fat-free mass) after estrogen suppression or in rates of protein synthesis or degradation; carbohydrate, lipid, or protein oxidation; muscle strength; calcium kinetics; or bone growth factors concentrations. However, E2 concentrations decreased 48% (P = 0.006), with no significant change in mean and peak GH concentrations, but with an 18% decrease in plasma insulin-like growth factor I concentrations. There was a 58% increase in serum T (P = 0.0001), sex hormone-binding globulin did not change, whereas LH and FSH concentrations increased (P < 0.02, both). Serum bone markers, osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and rates of bone calcium deposition and resorption did not change. In conclusion, these data suggest that in the male 1) estrogens do not contribute significantly to the changes in body composition and protein synthesis observed with changing androgen levels; 2) estrogen is a main regulator of the gonadal-pituitary feedback for the gonadotropin axis; and 3) this level of aromatase inhibition does not negatively impact either kinetically measured rates of bone calcium turnover or indirect markers of bone calcium turnover, at least in the short term. Further studies will provide valuable information on whether timed aromatase inhibition can be useful in increasing the height potential of pubertal boys with profound growth retardation without the confounding negative effects of gonadal androgen suppression.",

Overall, the rate of an additional surgical intervention (BCS and mastectomy combined) after initial breast conserving surgery was 24/53 (45%) in the MRI group versus 14/50 (28%) in the control group (p=0.069).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Addition of MRI to routine clinical care in patients with nonpalpable breast cancer was paradoxically associated with an increased re-excision rate. Breast MRI should not be used routinely for preoperative work-up of patients with nonpalpable breast cancer.",

After 1976, patients in both groups who had positive axillary nodes also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.",
        "Results/Findings": "Thirty women in the group that underwent breast-conserving therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the same breast, whereas eight women in the radical-mastectomy group had local recurrences (P<0.001). The crude cumulative incidence of these events was 8.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, after 20 years. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rates of contralateral-breast carcinomas, distant metastases, or second primary cancers. After a median follow-up of 20 years, the rate of death from all causes was 41.7 percent in the group that underwent breast-conserving surgery and 41.2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group (P=1.0).

Primary end points were rates of in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and contralateral breast cancers (CBCs). Median follow-up was 7.9 years for mutation carriers and 6.7 years for controls.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no significant difference in IBTR overall between carriers and controls; 10- and 15-year estimates were 12% and 24% for carriers and 9% and 17% for controls, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; P = .19). Multivariate analyses for IBTR found BRCA1/2 mutation status to be an independent predictor of IBTR when carriers who had undergone oophorectomy were removed from analysis (HR, 1.99; P = .04); the incidence of IBTR in carriers who had undergone oophorectomy was not significantly different from that in sporadic controls (P = .37). CBCs were significantly greater in carriers versus controls, with 10- and 15-year estimates of 26% and 39% for carriers and 3% and 7% for controls, respectively (HR, 10.43; P < .0001). Tamoxifen use significantly reduced risk of CBCs in mutation carriers (HR, 0.31; P = .05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "IBTR risk at 10 years is similar in BRCA1/2 carriers treated with breast conservation surgery who undergo oophorectomy versus sporadic controls.

As compared with standard therapy, weekly paclitaxel was also associated with improved survival (odds ratio, 1.32; P=0.01). An exploratory analysis of a subgroup of patients whose tumors expressed no human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 protein found similar improvements in disease-free and overall survival with weekly paclitaxel treatment, regardless of hormone-receptor expression.

        "Results/Findings": "PFS was significantly longer for fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 362) than 250 mg (n = 374) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.94; P = .006), corresponding to a 20% reduction in risk of progression. Objective response rate was similar for fulvestrant 500 mg and 250 mg (9.1% v 10.2%, respectively). CBR was 45.6% for fulvestrant 500 mg and 39.6% for fulvestrant 250 mg. DoCB and OS were 16.6 and 25.1 months, respectively, for the 500-mg group, whereas DoCB and OS were 13.9 and 22.8 months, respectively, in the 250-mg group. Fulvestrant 500 mg was well tolerated with no dose-dependent adverse events. QOL was similar for both arms.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Fulvestrant 500 mg was associated with a statistically significant increase in PFS and not associated with increased toxicity, corresponding to a clinically meaningful improvement in benefit versus risk compared with fulvestrant 250 mg.",

        "Background/Purpose": "We aimed to report on long-term outcomes of patients with small, node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab and to establish potential biomarkers to predict prognosis.",
        "Methods": "In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients aged 18 years or older, with small (≤3 cm), node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, were recruited from 16 institutions in 13 cities in the USA. Eligible patients were given intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m ) with intravenous trastuzumab (loading dose of 4 mg/kg, subsequent doses 2 mg/kg) weekly for 12 weeks, followed by trastuzumab (weekly at 2 mg/kg or once every 3 weeks at 6 mg/kg) for 40 weeks to complete a full year of trastuzumab. The primary endpoint was 3-year invasive disease-free survival. Here, we report 10-year survival outcomes, assessed in all participants who received protocol-defined treatment, with exploratory analyses using the HER2DX genomic tool. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is closed to accrual.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 29, 2007, and Sept 3, 2010, 410 patients were enrolled and 406 were given adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab and included in the analysis. Mean age at enrolment was 55 years (SD 10·5), 405 (99·8%) of 406 patients were female and one (0·2%) was male, 350 (86·2%) were White, 28 (6·9%) were Black or African American, and 272 (67·0%) had hormone receptor-positive disease. After a median follow-up of 10·8 years (IQR 7·1-11·4), among 406 patients included in the analysis population, we observed 31 invasive disease-free survival events, of which six (19·4%) were locoregional ipsilateral recurrences, nine (29·0%) were new contralateral breast cancers, six (19·4%) were distant recurrences, and ten (32·3%) were all-cause deaths. 10-year invasive disease-free survival was 91·3% (95% CI 88·3-94·4), 10-year recurrence-free interval was 96·3% (95% CI 94·3-98·3), 10-year overall survival was 94·3% (95% CI 91·8-96·8), and 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 98·8% (95% CI 97·6-100). HER2DX risk score as a continuous variable was significantly associated with invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-unit increment 1·24 [95% CI 1·00-1·52]; p=0·047) and recurrence-free interval (1·45 [1·09-1·93]; p=0·011).",

Here, we present 5-year results of the FAST-Forward trial.",
        "Methods": "FAST-Forward is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial done at 97 hospitals (47 radiotherapy centres and 50 referring hospitals) in the UK. Patients aged at least 18 years with invasive carcinoma of the breast (pT1-3, pN0-1, M0) after breast conservation surgery or mastectomy were eligible. We randomly allocated patients to either 40 Gy in 15 fractions (over 3 weeks), 27 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week), or 26 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week) to the whole breast or chest wall. Allocation was not masked because of the nature of the intervention. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour relapse; assuming a 2% 5-year incidence for 40 Gy, non-inferiority was predefined as ≤1·6% excess for five-fraction schedules (critical hazard ratio [HR] of 1·81). Normal tissue effects were assessed by clinicians, patients, and from photographs. This trial is registered at isrctn.com, ISRCTN19906132.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Nov 24, 2011, and June 19, 2014, we recruited and obtained consent from 4096 patients from 97 UK centres, of whom 1361 were assigned to the 40 Gy schedule, 1367 to the 27 Gy schedule, and 1368 to the 26 Gy schedule. At a median follow-up of 71·5 months (IQR 71·3 to 71·7), the primary endpoint event occurred in 79 patients (31 in the 40 Gy group, 27 in the 27 Gy group, and 21 in the 26 Gy group); HRs versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 0·86 (95% CI 0·51 to 1·44) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 0·67 (0·38 to 1·16) for 26 Gy in five fractions. 5-year incidence of ipsilateral breast tumour relapse after 40 Gy was 2·1% (1·4 to 3·1); estimated absolute differences versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were -0·3% (-1·0 to 0·9) for 27 Gy in five fractions (probability of incorrectly accepting an inferior five-fraction schedule: p=0·0022 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions) and -0·7% (-1·3 to 0·3) for 26 Gy in five fractions (p=0·00019 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions). At 5 years, any moderate or marked clinician-assessed normal tissue effects in the breast or chest wall was reported for 98 of 986 (9·9%) 40 Gy patients, 155 (15·4%) of 1005 27 Gy patients, and 121 of 1020 (11·9%) 26 Gy patients. Across all clinician assessments from 1-5 years, odds ratios versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 1·55 (95% CI 1·32 to 1·83, p<0·0001) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 1·12 (0·94 to 1·34, p=0·20) for 26 Gy in five fractions. Patient and photographic assessments showed higher normal tissue effect risk for 27 Gy versus 40 Gy but not for 26 Gy versus 40 Gy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "26 Gy in five fractions over 1 week is non-inferior to the standard of 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for local tumour control, and is as safe in terms of normal tissue effects up to 5 years for patients prescribed adjuvant local radiotherapy after primary surgery for early-stage breast cancer.",

Both study treatments were administered intravenously every 21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or stoppage at the request of investigator or patient. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included assessments of response rate, disease duration, overall survival, and characterisation of the toxicity profiles of both regimens. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between 2001 and 2005, 252 women were recruited and randomised for treatment. One of these patients was ineligible. Prognostic factors were well balanced between treatment groups (median number of metastatic sites in combination group 2 (range 0-5) and in vinorelbine group 2 (range 1-6); visceral disease in 76% and 75% of patients, respectively). Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI 4.8-7.1) for patients given gemcitabine plus vinorelbine and 4.0 months (2.9-5.1) for those assigned vinorelbine; there was 1.9 months of difference (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.50-0.88]; p=0.0028). Overall survival was 15.9 months (12.6-19.1) for the gemcitabine plus vinorelbine group and 16.4 months (11.6-21.0) for the vinorelbine group; there was 0.5 months of difference (hazard ratio 1.04 [0.78-1.39]; p=0.8046). Objective response rates were 36% for patients assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine (n=45) and 26% for those assigned vinorelbine (n=33) (p=0.093). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 75 (61% [52-70]) of the participants assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, compared with 55 (44% [35-53]) of those assigned vinorelbine alone (p=0.0074). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 13 (11%) of those assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, and in seven (6%) of those assigned vinorelbine alone (p=0.15). Incidences of grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxic effects were similar between the two treatment groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with metastatic breast cancer assigned gemcitabine and vinorelbine had better progression-free survival compared with those assigned vinorelbine alone. However, this finding did not translate into a difference in overall survival. Although toxicity was manageable, patients in the combined group had more haematological toxic effects. These factors should be taken into account when deciding which chemotherapy patients should receive.",

        "Results/Findings": "A protocol-specified analysis was performed at a median follow-up of 36 months: 315 patients had experienced relapse or died, compared with 515 expected treatment failures. Dose-dense treatment improved the primary end point, DFS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; P =.010), and OS (RR = 0.69; P =.013). Four-year DFS was 82% for the dose-dense regimens and 75% for the others. There was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.",

Among the 245 women for whom BCS was attempted, the pMRI cohort underwent fewer mean surgeries (1.3 vs. 1.7, p < 0.001) with a greater single successful BCS rate (77% vs. 43%, p < 0.001). Compared to published data, women with pMRI who underwent BCS experienced fewer surgeries (difference (Δ) = -0.22 vs. -0.17, p < 0.001) with a higher single successful BCS rate (Δ = +20% vs. +14%, p < 0.001).",

An overall response rate of between 30% and 42% was reported for single-agent docetaxel, which was higher in comparison to response rates attained with the combination chemotherapy regimens in all three trials. Noteworthy were findings of a significantly improved overall survival for docetaxel-treated patients in one of the comparative trials. These results firmly establish docetaxel as preferred therapy over combination chemotherapy regimens with mitomycin C plus vinblastine, methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil, or 5-fluorouracil plus vinorelbine in the therapy of anthracycline-resistant and/or anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients. The results document the continued high level of docetaxel antitumor activity in previously anthracycline-exposed patients initially reported in phase II trials and confirm a substantial lack of anthracycline cross-resistance. The higher response rate of single-agent docetaxel versus single-agent doxorubicin as demonstrated in a fourth randomized phase III trial gives credence to the presumption that the combination of these two agents may provide a highly effective chemotherapy regimen in the management of breast cancer patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Understanding of the biology and clinical behavior of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is currently inadequate. The aim of this comprehensive review was to identify important molecular biological markers associated with DCIS and candidate markers associated with increased risk of ipsilateral recurrence after diagnosis of DCIS. A comprehensive systematic review was performed to identify studies published in the past 10 years that investigated biological markers in DCIS. To be included in this review, studies that investigated the rate of biological expression of markers had to report on at least 30 patients; studies that analyzed the recurrence risk associated with biomarker expression had to report on at least 50 patients. There were 6,252 patients altogether in our review. Biological markers evaluated included steroid receptors, proliferation markers, cell cycle regulation and apoptotic markers, angiogenesis-related proteins, epidermal growth factor receptor family receptors, extracellular matrix-related proteins, and COX-2. Although the studies in this review provide valuable preliminary information regarding the expression and prognostic significance of biomarkers in DCIS, common limitations of published studies (case-series, cohort, and case-control studies) were that they were limited to small patient cohorts in which the extent of surgery and use of radiotherapy or endocrine therapy varied from patient to patient, and variable methods of determining biomarker expression. These constraints made it difficult to interpret the absolute effect of expression of various biomarkers on risk of local recurrence. No prospective validation studies were identified. As the study of biomarkers are in their relative infancy in DCIS compared with invasive breast cancer, key significant prognostic and predictive markers associated with invasive breast cancer have not been adequately studied in DCIS. There is a critical need for prospective analyses of novel and other known breast cancer molecular markers in large cohorts of patient with DCIS to differentiate indolent from aggressive DCIS and better tailor the need and extent of current therapies.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tumour mutational burden (TMB) has been retrospectively correlated with response to immune checkpoint blockade. We prospectively explored the association of high tissue TMB (tTMB-high) with outcomes in ten tumour-type-specific cohorts from the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 study, which assessed the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab in patients with selected, previously treated, advanced solid tumours.",
        "Methods": "In the multi-cohort, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 study, patients were enrolled from 81 academic facilities and community-based institutions across 21 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (ie, unresectable or metastatic, or both) incurable solid tumour (eligible tumour types were anal, biliary, cervical, endometrial, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small-cell lung, thyroid, and vulvar), progression on or intolerance to one or more lines of standard therapy, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) assessed by independent central radiological review, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 3 months, adequate organ function, and a tumour sample for biomarker analysis. Participants were given pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Tissue TMB (tTMB) was assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples using the FoundationOne CDx assay (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA). The prespecified definition of tTMB-high status was at least 10 mutations per megabase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (version 1.1) by independent central review. This prespecified analysis assessed the association between antitumour activity and tTMB in treated patients with evaluable tTMB data. Efficacy was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab, had evaluable tTMB data, and were enrolled at least 26 weeks before data cutoff (June 27, 2019), and safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and had tTMB-high status. KEYNOTE-158 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 15, 2016, and June 25, 2019, 1073 patients were enrolled. 1066 participants were treated as of data cutoff (June 27, 2019), of whom 805 (76%) were evaluable for TMB, and 105 (13%) of 805 had tTMB-high status and were assessed for safety. 1050 (98%) of 1066 patients enrolled by at least 26 weeks before data cutoff, of whom 790 (75%) were evaluable for TMB and included in efficacy analyses. 102 (13%) of these 790 patients had tTMB-high status (≥10 mutations per megabase), and 688 (87%) patients had non-tTMB-high status (<10 mutations per megabase). Median study follow-up was 37·1 months (IQR 35·0-38·3). Objective responses were observed in 30 (29%; 95% CI 21-39) of 102 patients in the tTMB-high group and 43 (6%; 5-8) of 688 in the non-tTMB-high group. 11 (10%) of 105 patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. 16 (15%) participants had a grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event, of which colitis was the only such adverse event that occurred in more than one patient (n=2). One patient had fatal pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator to be treatment related.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "tTMB-high status identifies a subgroup of patients who could have a robust tumour response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. tTMB could be a novel and useful predictive biomarker for response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic advanced solid tumours.",

        "Methods": "One hundred and thirty-nine patients underwent histological sampling of suspected breast cancer recurrence. All the pathology assessments [ER, PgR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)] on both primaries and confirmed recurrences were performed at the same laboratory.",
        "Results/Findings": "A breast cancer recurrence was confirmed in 119 cases. Rates of discordance were 13.4%, 39% and 11.8% for ER, PgR and HER2, respectively. Ninety-two patients maintained the same tumor phenotype [i.e. the same hormone receptors (HR) and HER2 status], whereas 27 (22.7%) changed during progression. The loss of HR positivity and the loss of HER2 positivity resulted in a worse post-recurrence survival (P=0.01 and P=0.008, respectively) and overall survival (OS; P=0.06 and P=0.0002, respectively), compared with the corresponding concordant-positive cases. Tumor phenotype discordance was associated with worse post-recurrence and OS (P=0.006 and P=0.002, respectively); those cases who turned into triple-negative experienced the poorest outcome, respect to the concordant group (P=0.001, OS).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tumor pathologic features and the extent of nodal involvement dictate whether radiation therapy is given after mastectomy for breast cancer. It is generally well accepted that radiation negatively influences the outcome of implant-based breast reconstruction. However, the long-term effect of radiation therapy on the outcome of breast reconstruction with the free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap is still unclear. For patients who need postmastectomy radiation therapy, the optimal timing of TRAM flap reconstruction is controversial. This study compares the outcome of immediate and delayed free TRAM flap breast reconstruction in patients who received postmastectomy radiation therapy. All patients at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center who received postmastectomy radiation therapy and who also underwent free TRAM flap breast reconstruction between January of 1988 and December of 1998 were included in the study. Patients who received radiation therapy before delayed TRAM flap reconstruction were compared with patients who underwent immediate TRAM flap reconstruction before radiation therapy. Early and late complications were compared between the two groups. Early complications included vessel thrombosis, partial or total flap loss, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, and local wound-healing problems, whereas late complications included fat necrosis, volume loss, and flap contracture of free TRAM breast mounds. Late complications were evaluated at least 1 year after the completion of radiation therapy for patients who had delayed reconstruction and at least 1 year after reconstruction for patients who had immediate reconstruction. During the study period, 32 patients had immediate TRAM flap reconstruction before radiation therapy and 70 patients had radiation therapy before TRAM flap reconstruction. Mean follow-up times for the immediate reconstruction and delayed reconstruction groups were 3 and 5 years, respectively. The mean radiation dose was 50 Gy in the immediate reconstruction group and 51 Gy in the delayed reconstruction group. One complete flap loss occurred in the delayed reconstruction group, and no flap loss occurred in the immediate reconstruction group. The incidence of early complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, the incidence of late complications was significantly higher in the immediate reconstruction group than in the delayed reconstruction group (87.5 percent versus 8.6 percent; p = 0.000). Nine patients (28 percent) in the immediate reconstruction group required an additional flap to correct the distorted contour from flap shrinkage and severe flap contraction. These findings indicate that, in patients who are candidates for free TRAM flap breast reconstruction and need postmastectomy radiation therapy, reconstruction should be delayed until radiation therapy is complete.",

        "Background/Purpose": "TRK fusions are oncogenic drivers of various adult and paediatric cancers. The first-generation TRK inhibitors, larotrectinib and entrectinib, were granted landmark, tumour-agnostic regulatory approvals for the treatment of these cancers in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Brisk and durable responses are achieved with these drugs in patients, including those with locally advanced or metastatic disease. In addition, intracranial activity has been observed with both agents in TRK fusion-positive solid tumours with brain metastases and primary brain tumours. While resistance to first-generation TRK inhibition can eventually occur, next-generation agents such as selitrectinib (BAY 2731954, LOXO-195) and repotrectinib were designed to address on-target resistance, which is mediated by emergent kinase domain mutations, such as those that result in substitutions at solvent front or gatekeeper residues. These next-generation drugs are currently available in the clinic and proof-of-concept responses have been reported. This underscores the utility of sequential TRK inhibitor use in select patients, a paradigm that parallels the use of targeted therapies in other oncogenic driver-positive cancers, such as ALK fusion-positive lung cancers. While TRK inhibitors have a favourable overall safety profile, select on-target adverse events, including weight gain, dizziness/ataxia and paraesthesias, are occasionally observed and should be monitored in the clinic. These side-effects are likely consequences of the inhibition of the TRK pathway that is involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.",

TNBC was associated with increased risk for visceral metastases (P = .0005), lower risk for bone recurrence (P = .027), and shorter postrecurrence survival (P < .0001). Recurrence and death rates were higher for TNBC only in the first 3 years. If pCR was achieved, patients with TNBC and non-TNBC had similar survival (P = .24). In contrast, patients with residual disease (RD) had worse OS if they had TNBC compared with non-TNBC (P < .0001).",

        "Methods": "Overall, 1130 patients with breast carcinoma who had all types of bone metastases (osteolytic, mixed, or osteoblastic by radiology) were randomized to receive treatment with either 4 mg of Zol or 8 mg of Zol as a 15-minute infusion or 90 mg of Pam as a 2-hour infusion every 3-4 weeks for 12 months. A skeletal-related event (SRE) was defined as a pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiotherapy, or surgery to bone.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among all patients with BC, the proportion of those who had an SRE (primary endpoint) was comparable between treatment groups (43% of patients who received 4 mg of Zol vs. 45% of patients who received Pam). Among patients who had breast carcinoma with at least 1 osteolytic lesion (n = 528 patients), the proportion with an SRE was lower in the 4-mg Zol group compared with the Pam group (48% vs. 58%), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.058). The time to first SRE was significantly longer in the 4-mg Zol group compared with the Pam group (median, 310 vs. 174 days; P = 0.013). Moreover, multiple-event analysis demonstrated significant further reductions in the risk of developing SREs over the reduction achieved with Pam (30% in the osteolytic subset [P = 0.010] and 20% for all patients with BC [P = 0.037]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The current data indicate that treatment with 4 mg of Zol was more effective than 90 mg of Pam in reducing skeletal complications in a subset of patients with breast carcinoma who had at least 1 osteolytic lesion at study entry.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years as up-front monotherapy or after tamoxifen therapy is the treatment of choice for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Extending treatment with an aromatase inhibitor to 10 years may further reduce the risk of breast-cancer recurrence.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of the extended use of letrozole for an additional 5 years. Our primary end point was disease-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "We enrolled 1918 women. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there were 165 events involving disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (67 with letrozole and 98 with placebo) and 200 deaths (100 in each group). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 96) with letrozole and 91% (95% CI; 89 to 93) with placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, 0.66; P=0.01 by a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to nodal status, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, the interval from the last dose of aromatase-inhibitor therapy, and the duration of treatment with tamoxifen). The rate of 5-year overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with letrozole and 94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.97; P=0.83). The annual incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in the letrozole group was 0.21% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32), and the rate in the placebo group was 0.49% (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.67) (hazard ratio, 0.42; P=0.007). Bone-related toxic effects occurred more frequently among patients receiving letrozole than among those receiving placebo, including a higher incidence of bone pain, bone fractures, and new-onset osteoporosis. No significant differences between letrozole and placebo were observed in scores on most subscales measuring quality of life.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The extension of treatment with an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor to 10 years resulted in significantly higher rates of disease-free survival and a lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer than those with placebo, but the rate of overall survival was not higher with the aromatase inhibitor than with placebo.

        "Background/Purpose": "Treating patients with anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer (MBC) represents a significant challenge to oncologists. The tumour-activated oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, is the only treatment approved for these patients. Our study evaluated the efficacy, safety and impact on quality of life (QOL) of capecitabine in this setting. Patients (n=126) with anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer received capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14, followed by a 7-day rest period. Median time to progression was 4.9 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 4.0-6.4). Thirty-five patients (28%) achieved an objective response (95% CI: 20-36%), including five (4%) complete responses. Median overall survival was 15.2 months (95% CI: 13.5-19.6 months). Capecitabine demonstrated a favourable safety profile, with a low incidence of treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events. The most common adverse events were hand-foot syndrome and gastrointestinal effects. QOL assessment showed that capecitabine treatment was associated with an increase in mean Global Health Score. Capecitabine is active, well tolerated and improves the QOL of patients with anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Based on the consistently high activity demonstrated in clinical trials, capecitabine has become the reference treatment in this setting.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Trastuzumab/chemotherapy combinations have already shown superior results in metastatic breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel in women with locally advanced breast cancer, with or without metastatic disease. Treatment-naive women with HER2-overexpressing locally advanced breast cancer, with or without metastatic disease, were included. Patients received trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose intravenously then 2 mg/kg weekly. On day 22, docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles was added to weekly trastuzumab. Patients then underwent surgery and subsequent 4 cycles of AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide; 60/600 mg/m2) without trastuzumab. Weekly trastuzumab was resumed 1 month after completion of AC and continued for a year. Preliminary results from the first 22 patients with median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2-38 months) are reported. Of these, 9 patients (40.9%) had inflammatory breast cancer, and 6 patients (27.3%) had stage IV breast cancer. Seventeen of 22 patients (77.3%) had objective clinical response, with a clinical complete response in 9 patients (40.9%). Two patients (9.1%) had decline in cardiac function and 7 patients (31.8%) experienced neutropenia, with 2 deaths (9.1%) from neutropenic sepsis. Eight patients (36.4%) have relapsed, 3 with local skin recurrence (13.6%) and 5 with distant recurrence, of whom 1 had liver metastasis (4.5%) and 4 had brain metastasis (18.2%). Combined neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel induced high clinical response rates for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, in particular for inflammatory breast cancer. A high rate of brain metastasis was noted, particularly in patients with baseline metastatic disease.",

At the first planned interim analysis (median follow-up of one year), 347 events (recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, second nonbreast malignant disease, or death) were observed: 127 events in the trastuzumab group and 220 in the observation group. The unadjusted hazard ratio for an event in the trastuzumab group, as compared with the observation group, was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.67; P<0.0001 by the log-rank test, crossing the interim analysis boundary), representing an absolute benefit in terms of disease-free survival at two years of 8.4 percentage points.

Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality.",

Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs).",
        "Results/Findings": "Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p<0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p<0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p<0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p<0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p<0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, -0·3 to 1·1; p=0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0-1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2-4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5-9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1-3, and N4+ disease).",

Initiation of trastuzumab required normal post-AC left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on multiple-gated acquisition scan. If symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) developed, source documents were blindly reviewed by an independent panel of cardiologists to determine whether criteria were met for a cardiac event (CE), which was defined as New York Heart Association class III or IV CHF or possible/probable cardiac death. Frequencies of CEs were compared between arms.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among patients with normal post-AC LVEF who began post-AC treatment, five of 814 control patients subsequently had confirmed CEs (four CHFs and one cardiac death) compared with 31 of 850 trastuzumab-treated patients (31 CHFs and no cardiac deaths). The difference in cumulative incidence at 3 years was 3.3% (4.1% for trastuzumab-treated patients minus 0.8% for control patients; 95% CI, 1.7% to 4.9%). Twenty-seven of the 31 patients in the trastuzumab arm have been followed for > or = 6 months after diagnosis of a CE; 26 were asymptomatic at last assessment, and 18 remained on cardiac medication. CHFs were more frequent in older patients and patients with marginal post-AC LVEF. Fourteen percent of patients discontinued trastuzumab because of asymptomatic decreases in LVEF; 4% discontinued trastuzumab because of symptomatic cardiotoxicity.",

Long-term follow-up results on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) have been awaited.",
        "Methods": "Patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in the NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31 trials. The similar design of both trials allowed data from the control and trastuzumab-containing arms to be combined in a joint analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "At 3.9 years of median follow-up, there continues to be a highly statistically significant reduction in DFS event rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). Similarly, there continues to be a statistically significant 39% reduction in death rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data demonstrate consistent DFS and OS advantages of adjuvant trastuzumab over time, with the longest follow-up reported to date. The clinical benefits continue to outweigh the risks of adverse effects.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Trastuzumab improves survival in the adjuvant treatment of HER-positive breast cancer, although combined therapy with anthracycline-based regimens has been associated with cardiac toxicity. We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new nonanthracycline regimen with trastuzumab.",
        "Methods": "We randomly assigned 3222 women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel every 3 weeks (AC-T), the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (AC-T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (TCH). The primary study end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 65 months, 656 events triggered this protocol-specified analysis. The estimated disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 75% among patients receiving AC-T, 84% among those receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, and 81% among those receiving TCH. Estimated rates of overall survival were 87%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. No significant differences in efficacy (disease-free or overall survival) were found between the two trastuzumab regimens, whereas both were superior to AC-T. The rates of congestive heart failure and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group (P<0.001). Eight cases of acute leukemia were reported: seven in the groups receiving the anthracycline-based regimens and one in the TCH group subsequent to receiving an anthracycline outside the study.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improved disease-free and overall survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. The risk-benefit ratio favored the nonanthracycline TCH regimen over AC-T plus trastuzumab, given its similar efficacy, fewer acute toxic effects, and lower risks of cardiotoxicity and leukemia.

We conducted a pilot study of preoperative trastuzumab and paclitaxel, followed by surgery and adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in earlier stage breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Patients with HER2-positive (2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry) stage II or III breast cancer received preoperative trastuzumab (4 mg/kg x 1, then 2 mg/kg/wk x 11) in combination with paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks x 4). Patients received adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy following definitive breast surgery. Clinical and pathologic response rates were determined after preoperative therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction and circulating levels of HER2 extracellular domain were measured serially.",
        "Results/Findings": "Preoperative trastuzumab and paclitaxel achieved clinical response in 75% and complete pathologic response in 18% of the 40 women on study. HER2 3+ tumors were more likely to respond than 2+ tumors (84% v 38%). No unexpected treatment-related noncardiac toxicity was encountered. Four patients developed grade 2 cardiotoxicity (asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction). Baseline HER2 extracellular domain was elevated in 24% of patients and declined with preoperative therapy. Immunohistochemical analyses of posttherapy tumor specimens indicated varying patterns of HER2 expression following trastuzumab-based treatment.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Preoperative trastuzumab and paclitaxel is active against HER2 overexpressing early-stage breast cancer and may be feasible as part of a sequential treatment program including anthracyclines. The observed changes in cardiac function merit further investigation. Correlative analyses of HER2 status may facilitate understanding of tumor response and resistance to targeted therapy.",

        "Methods": "Six tumor markers for colorectal cancer and eight for breast cancer were considered. They could be recommended or not for routine use or for special circumstances. In addition to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 15-3, CA 27.29 was also considered among the serum tumor markers for breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "In general, the significant health outcomes identified for use in making clinical practice guidelines (overall survival, disease-free survival, quality of life, lesser toxicity, and cost-effectiveness) were used.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A computerized literature search from 1994 to March 1999 was performed.",

        "Methods": "A multidisciplinary international Expert Panel was convened to update the clinical practice guideline recommendations informed by a systematic review of the medical literature.",
        "Results/Findings": "The Expert Panel continues to recommend ER testing of invasive breast cancers by validated immunohistochemistry as the standard for predicting which patients may benefit from endocrine therapy, and no other assays are recommended for this purpose. Breast cancer samples with 1% to 100% of tumor nuclei positive should be interpreted as ER positive. However, the Expert Panel acknowledges that there are limited data on endocrine therapy benefit for cancers with 1% to 10% of cells staining ER positive. Samples with these results should be reported using a new reporting category, ER Low Positive, with a recommended comment. A sample is considered ER negative if < 1% or 0% of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive. Additional strategies recommended to promote optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of cases with an initial low to no ER staining result include establishing a laboratory-specific standard operating procedure describing additional steps used by the laboratory to confirm/adjudicate results. The status of controls should be reported for cases with 0% to 10% staining. Similar principles apply to PgR testing, which is used primarily for prognostic purposes in the setting of an ER-positive cancer. Testing of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for ER is recommended to determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies to reduce risk of future breast cancer, while testing DCIS for PgR is considered optional.

        "Methods": "A systematic review of the literature published from March 2006 through January 2013 was completed using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library. An Update Panel reviewed the evidence and updated the recommendation language.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 222 new publications that met inclusion criteria. A majority were observational studies, cohort studies, and case series or reports, with few randomized clinical trials. After review of the new evidence, the Update Panel concluded that no major, substantive revisions to the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations were warranted, but clarifications were added.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "As part of education and informed consent before cancer therapy, health care providers (including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, gynecologic oncologists, urologists, hematologists, pediatric oncologists, and surgeons) should address the possibility of infertility with patients treated during their reproductive years (or with parents or guardians of children) and be prepared to discuss fertility preservation options and/or to refer all potential patients to appropriate reproductive specialists. Although patients may be focused initially on their cancer diagnosis, the Update Panel encourages providers to advise patients regarding potential threats to fertility as early as possible in the treatment process so as to allow for the widest array of options for fertility preservation. The discussion should be documented. Sperm and embryo cryopreservation as well as oocyte cryopreservation are considered standard practice and are widely available. Other fertility preservation methods should be considered investigational and should be performed by providers with the necessary expertise.",

        "Methods": "We performed a systematic review to resolve these questions, using standard Cochrane methodology to identify, select and appraise relevant randomised trials.",
        "Results/Findings": "Four randomised controlled trials involving 3925 women were identified. All were high quality with minimal risk of bias. Analysis confirmed a statistically significant benefit from the addition of radiotherapy on all ipsilateral breast events (HR=0.49; 95% CI 0.41-0.58, p<0.00001). All subgroups analysed (margin status, age and grade) benefited from the addition of radiotherapy. Nine women require treatment with radiotherapy to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence (NNT=9). Deaths due to vascular disease, pulmonary toxicity and second cancers were low and not significantly higher for women who received radiotherapy.",

        "Methods": "This article reviews data presented at the National Cancer Institute State of the Science Conference on Preoperative Therapy in Invasive Breast Cancer as well as supporting published data.",
        "Results/Findings": "Preoperative chemotherapy in operable breast cancer has been shown to improve breast conservation rates as a result of tumor response to therapy. When patients are given preoperative systemic therapy, regimens should be the same as those established as safe and active in the adjuvant setting. At present, there are no data to suggest that systemic treatment should be tailored based on initial tumor response, or based on the extent of residual disease. In operable breast cancer, there seems to be no survival advantage from initiation of systemic therapy before surgery. A variety of clinical, imaging, and pathologic measurements are available to gauge tumor response to treatment. There is a clear correlation between tumor response in the breast and lymph nodes and both disease-free and overall survival. Pathologic complete response and other pathologic measures may be useful as surrogate end points in evaluating and understanding new therapies.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In operable breast cancer, preoperative systemic therapy is effective and can improve breast conservation rates. Unless the tumor is large or the patient is in a clinical trial, postoperative adjuvant systemic therapy is the standard of care. To achieve optimal outcomes, preoperative systemic therapy must be administered as part of a coordinated, multimodality treatment program. The preoperative setting provides a unique opportunity to study the impact of systemic therapies on breast cancer biology.",

        "Methods": "A total of 178 patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma were treated in the past 20 years at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center by a combined-modality approach under four different protocols. Each protocol included induction chemotherapy, then local therapy (radiotherapy or mastectomy), then adjuvant chemotherapy, and, if mastectomy was performed, adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with or without vincristine and prednisone (VP). In protocol D, patients received an alternate adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, methotrexate and vinblastine (MV), if they did not have a complete response (CR) to induction chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up of live patients in group A was 215 months, in group B 186 months, in group C 116 months, and in group D 45 months. An estimated 28% of patients were currently free of disease beyond 15 years. At the time of analysis, 50 patients were alive without any evidence of disease. A further 12 patients died of intercurrent illness, and 15 patients were followed beyond 10 years without recurrence of disease. Among initial recurrence, 20% of patients had local failure, 39% systemic failure, and 9% CNS recurrence. Initial response to induction chemotherapy was an important prognostic factor. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 15 years was 44% in patients who had a CR to induction chemotherapy, 31% in those who had a partial response (PR), and 7% in those who had less than a PR. There was no improvement in overall survival (OS) or DFS among patients who underwent alternate chemotherapy (MV) compared with those who did not. Using surgery and radiotherapy as opposed to radiotherapy alone as local therapy did not have an impact on the DFS or OS rate.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These long-term follow-up data show that with a combined-modality approach a significant fraction of patients (28%) remained free of disease beyond 15 years. In contrast, single-modality treatments yielded a DFS of less than 5%. Thus, using combined-modality treatment (chemotherapy, then mastectomy, then chemotherapy and radiotherapy) is recommended as a standard of care for inflammatory breast carcinoma.",

The study was approved by an institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Mammograms and sonograms were reviewed by two mammographers using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) mammographic and US lexicon. US assessment of the regional lymph node basins, including the axillary, infraclavicular, internal mammary, and supraclavicular regions, was documented. US was used to evaluate response to therapy in the breast and the regional lymph nodes in women who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-three women with 24 cancers that were imaged prior to surgery with mammography (n = 3), US (n = 4), or mammography and US (n = 17) were included in the study. The histologic diagnosis of the primary tumor was invasive ductal cancer in 22 lesions, and the diagnosis was invasive carcinoma in the two other cancers. The median age in this study was 34 years (range, 24-45 years). Of the 20 women who underwent preoperative mammography, findings were positive for malignancy in 18 of 20 (90%) cancers despite dense breast parenchymal patterns (BI-RADS types 3 and 4). A mass in all 21 cancers (100%) was depicted in the 20 women who underwent breast and nodal US. US correctly depicted axillary metastasis in 15 of 18 women who underwent US nodal assessment. Of the 12 patients who were evaluated for response to chemotherapy, US demonstrated complete response in two patients, partial response in three, stable findings in one, and progression of disease in six.",

        "Results/Findings": "Of the 112 PMRT plans scored after reconstruction, 52% had compromises compared with 7% of matched controls (p < 0.0001). Of the compromised plans after reconstruction, 33% were considered to be moderately compromised plans and 19% were major compromised treatment plans. Optimal chest wall coverage, treatment of the ipsilateral internal mammary chain, lung minimization, and heart avoidance was achieved in 79%, 45%, 84%, and 84% of the plans in the group undergoing immediate reconstruction, compared respectively with 100%, 93%, 97%, and 92% of the plans in the control group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0015, and p = 0.1435). In patients with reconstructions, 67% of the \"major\" compromised radiotherapy plans were left-sided (p < 0.16).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Radiation treatment planning after immediate breast reconstruction was compromised in more than half of the patients (52%), with the largest compromises observed in those with left-sided cancers. For patients with locally advanced breast cancer, the potential for compromised PMRT planning should be considered when deciding between immediate and delayed reconstruction.",

        "Results/Findings": "The overall US-FNA sensitivity was set at 79.4%. The positive predictive value was calculated to be 100%, and the negative predictive value, 69.5%. The US-FNA sensitivity for lymph nodes with normal sonographic features was 0%, while for indeterminate lymph nodes it was 80% and, for suspicious lymph nodes, 90.5%.

        "Methods": "Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE and were included if they provided data on DCIS underestimates (overall and according to preoperative variables). Study-specific and pooled percentages for DCIS underestimates were calculated. By using meta-regression (random effects logistic modeling) the association between each study-level preoperative variable and understaged invasive breast cancer was investigated.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fifty-two studies that included 7350 cases of DCIS with findings at excision histologic examination as the reference standard met the eligibility criteria and were included. There were 1736 underestimates (invasive breast cancer at excision); the random-effects pooled estimate was 25.9% (95% confidence interval: 22.5%, 29.5%). Preoperative variables that showed significant univariate association with higher underestimation included the use of a 14-gauge automated device (vs 11-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy, P = .006), high-grade lesion at CNB (vs non-high grade lesion, P < .001), lesion size larger than 20 mm at imaging (vs lesions ≤ 20 mm, P < .001), Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score of 4 or 5 (vs BI-RADS score of 3, P for trend = .005), mammographic mass (vs calcification only, P < .001), and palpability (P < .001).",

Although treatment is effective, cytotoxic chemotherapy causes ovarian reserve depletion, whereas hormonal therapy necessitates a delay in pregnancy, resulting in infertility. Patients of reproductive age should be referred to fertility specialists to explore methods of fertility preservation upon diagnosis. The best established method of fertility preservation is embryo cryopreservation, although investigational techniques such as, oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, may hold potential. Embryo cryopreservation involves ovarian stimulation to retrieve oocytes in-vitro fertilization prior to freezing. Techniques for the cryopreservation of unfertilized oocytes are under investigation.

        "Methods": "Eligible patients underwent lumpectomy for DCIS that was mammogram detected, size ≤ 2.5 cm, final margins ≥ 3 mm, and low or intermediate nuclear grade. Consented patients were randomly assigned to RT or OBS. Tamoxifen use was optional. Cumulative incidence was used to estimate IBR, log-rank test and Gray's test to compare treatments, and Fine-Gray regression for hazard ratios (HRs).",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of six hundred thirty-six women were randomly assigned from 1999 to 2006. Median age was 58 years and mean pathologic DCIS size was 0.60 cm. Intention to use tamoxifen was balanced between arms (69%); however, actual receipt of tamoxifen varied, 58% RT versus 66% OBS (  = .05). At 13.9 years' median follow-up, the 15-year cumulative incidence of IBR was 7.1% (95% CI, 4.0 to 11.5) with RT versus 15.1% (95% CI, 10.8 to 20.2) OBS (  = .0007; HR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.66); and for invasive LR was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.7 to 9.5) RT versus 9.5% (95% CI, 6.0 to 13.9) OBS (  = .027; HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.91). On multivariable analysis, only RT (HR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.64;   = .0007) and tamoxifen use (HR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.78;   = .0047) were associated with reduced IBR.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "RT significantly reduced all and invasive IBR for good-risk DCIS with durable results at 15 years.

Of the 500 patients, the timing of TAM was unclear in five patients, was administered concurrently with RT in 254 patients (CON-TAM), and was administered sequentially after completion of RT in 241 patients (SEQ-TAM).",
        "Results/Findings": "There were no differences between the CON-TAM and SEQ-TAM group in T stage, estrogen and progesterone status, nodal status, histology, or margin status. The CON-TAM group was slightly older than the SEQ-TAM group (62 v 58 years) and received chemotherapy in addition to TAM less frequently (14% v 38%). As of September 2002, with a median follow-up of 10.0 years, there were no significant differences between the CON-TAM and SEQ-TAM groups in overall survival (84% v 82%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.234; 95% CI, 0.42 to 2.05; P = .45), distant-metastasis-free rate (82% v 78%; HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.68; P = .12), ipsilateral breast-relapse-free rate (90% v 86%; HR, 0.932; 95% CI, 0.42 to 2.05; P = .86), or contralateral breast-relapse-free rate (95% v 93%; HR, 0.892; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.48; P = .66).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although the concurrent use of TAM with RT may theoretically render cancer cells less responsive to RT, this retrospective study suggests that in practical application, concurrent administration of TAM with RT does not compromise local control.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To evaluate whether a relationship exists between docetaxel dose and clinical response in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Patients whose cancer had progressed after one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced breast cancer or had recurred during or within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to docetaxel 60, 75, or 100 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks.",
        "Results/Findings": "Five hundred twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned (intent to treat [ITT]), and 524 were assessable for toxicity. In the population assessable for efficacy (n = 407), logistic regression analysis showed that increasing docetaxel dose was significantly associated with higher response rate (P = .007) and improved time to progression (TTP; P = .014). In the ITT analysis, a significant dose-response relationship was observed for tumor response (P = .026) but not for TTP (P = .067). The incidences of most hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were related to increasing dose, with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurring in 76.4%, 83.7%, and 93.4% and febrile neutropenia occurring in 4.7%, 7.4%, and 14.1% of patients administered the 60, 75, and 100 mg/m2 doses, respectively. One death was considered treatment related.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A relationship between increasing dose of docetaxel and increased tumor response was observed across the dose range of 60 to 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Toxicities were related to increasing dose. Depending on the therapy goal, any of the doses studied may be appropriate for second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of weekly docetaxel plus trastuzumab in women with HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Efficacy was correlated with serum HER-2 extracellular domain (ECD) levels.",
        "Methods": "Thirty women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with weekly docetaxel and trastuzumab as first- or second-line therapy. Both docetaxel 35 mg/m(2)/wk and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg/wk were delivered in 4-week cycles consisting of three weekly treatments followed by 1 week of rest. A loading dose of trastuzumab 4 mg/kg was administered 1 day before the start of the first cycle.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median delivered dose-intensity of docetaxel was 24 mg/m(2)/wk (range, 18 to 27 mg/m(2)/wk). The intent-to-treat overall response rate (ORR) was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 80%). The ORR in patients whose tumors were HER-2-positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization was 67% (16 of 24 patients; 95% CI, 45% to 84%). In patients with elevated serum HER-2 ECD at baseline, the ORR was 76% (95% CI, 53% to 92%), compared with 33% (95% CI, 7% to 70%) in patients with low HER-2 ECD levels (P =.04). Variations in HER-2 ECD concentrations during treatment correlated with response to treatment. Median time to progression was 9 months. Acute toxicity, including myelosuppression, was mild. Fatigue, fluid retention, and excessive tearing became more common with repetitive dosing.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Weekly docetaxel and trastuzumab is an active combination for treating patients with HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Serum HER-2 ECD testing may be a promising method for monitoring patients on trastuzumab-based therapy.",

        "Methods": "Seventy-three eligible patients (median age, 73 years; range, 65 to 89 years) were enrolled. The first 30 patients received oral capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days. Due to the occurrence of two toxic deaths, capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily was given to the subsequent 43 patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "All patients were assessable for safety and efficacy. A total of 351 treatment cycles were administered (median, six per patient; range, one to eight cycles). Dose reductions due to toxicities were required in 30% of patients in the standard-dose group, but capecitabine was given without a dose reduction to 95% of patients in the low-dose group. Capecitabine demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The overall incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities was low: the most common events reported in </= 10% of the patients were fatigue, diarrhea, dyspnea, and nausea. In the standard-dose group, the response rate was 36.7% (95% CI, 19.9% to 56.1%). An additional seven patients had disease stabilization at >/= 24 weeks. In the low-dose group, the response rate was 34.9% (95% CI, 21% to 50.9%). An additional 15 patients had prolonged stabilization. The median time to disease progression was 4 months in either group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study shows that capecitabine is safe and effective in the elderly breast cancer patient. Based on the overall results, the capecitabine dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily merits consideration as \"standard\" for older patients who do not have severely impaired renal function.",

Dedicated breast pathologists confirmed HER2 positivity if 3+ by immunohistochemistry or if it had a ratio of 2.0 or greater by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy or trastuzumab were excluded. Kaplan-Meier product was used to calculate recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS). Cox proportional hazard models were fit to determine associations between HER2 status and survival after adjustment for patient and disease characteristics. Additionally, 350 breast cancers from two other institutions were used for validation.",
        "Results/Findings": "Ten percent of patients had HER2-positive tumors. At a median follow-up of 74 months, there were 72 recurrences. The 5-year RFS rates were 77.1% and 93.7% in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumors, respectively (P < .001). The 5-year DRFS rates were 86.4% and 97.2% in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumors, respectively (P < .001).

        "Methods": "We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 542 patients treated on six consecutive institutional prospective trials with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy, and radiation. These data were compared to those of 134 patients who received similar treatment in these same trials but without radiation.",
        "Results/Findings": "Irradiated patients had a lower rate of local-regional recurrence (LRR) (10-year rates: 11% v 22%, P = .0001). Radiation reduced LRR for patients with clinical T3 or T4 tumors, stage > or = IIB disease (AJCC 1988), pathological tumor size >2 cm, or four or more positive nodes (P < or = .002 for all comparisons). Patients who presented with clinically advanced stage III or IV disease but subsequently achieved a pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy still had a high rate of LRR, which was significantly reduced with radiation (10-year rates: 33% v 3%, P = .006). Radiation improved cause-specific survival (CSS) in the following subsets: stage > or = IIIB disease, clinical T4 tumors, and four or more positive nodes (P < or = .007 for all comparisons). On multivariate analyses of LRR and CSS, the hazard ratios for lack of radiation were 4.7 (95% CI, 2.7 to 8.1; P < .0001) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.9; P < .0001), respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, comprehensive radiation was found to benefit both local control and survival for patients presenting with clinical T3 tumors or stage III-IV (ipsilateral supraclavicular nodal) disease and for patients with four or more positive nodes. Radiation should be considered for these patients regardless of their response to initial chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "Forty-nine patients with metastatic breast cancer received paclitaxel via 3-hour intravenous infusion after standard premedication. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not used, and chemotherapy was cycled every 3 weeks. For 25 patients who received paclitaxel as initial therapy (group I), the starting dose was 250 mg/m2. Twenty-four patients who had received two or more prior regimens, including an anthracycline (group II), started at 175 mg/m2. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 23 patients in group I.",
        "Results/Findings": "Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included (groups I/II) neutropenia (36%/33%), thrombocytopenia (0%/8%), anemia (0%/13%), neuropathy (8%/0%), arthralgia/myalgia (16%/4%), and mucositis (4%/4%). No significant hypersensitivity-type reactions or cardiac arrhythmias were seen. Six patients who received paclitaxel at > or = 250 mg/m2 experienced transient photopsia, without apparent chronic neuro-ophthalmologic sequelae. The mean peak plasma paclitaxel concentration was 5.87 mumol/L (range, 1.99 to 7.89) for these patients, and 6.08 mumol/L (range, 0.81 to 13.81) for 17 of 19 patients who did not experience visual symptoms. In 25 assessable patients in group I at a median follow-up time of 12 months, one complete response (CR) and seven partial responses (PRs) have been observed, for a total response rate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15% to 53%). In group II, five PRs were noted in 24 assessable patients (20.8%; 95% CI, 7% to 42%). Median response durations were 7 months for group I and 4 months for group II.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Paclitaxel via 3-hour infusion, without prophylactic G-CSF, is active and safe as initial and subsequent therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The transient visual symptoms noted at higher doses seem unrelated to peak plasma paclitaxel concentration. Further studies that compare 3- and 24 hour (or other) infusion schedules are necessary to determine the optimal administration of paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer.",

        "Results/Findings": "Baseline mean tumor size was 9.2 cm (range, 4 to 32 cm). pCR occurred in breast in 11 patients (23%; 95% CI, 12% to 37%) and breast and axilla in eight patients (17%; 95% CI, 8% to 30%). pCR rates in breast (HER2 positive, seven of 30 patients, 23% v HER2 negative, four of 18 patients, 22%; P > .05) and breast and axilla (four of 30 patients, 13% v four of 18 patients, 22%, respectively; P > .05) were similar regardless of HER2 status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). At a median follow-up time of 43 months, 4-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 81% (95% CI, 64% to 90%); overall survival (OS) rate was 86% (95% CI, 71% to 94%). In patients with pCR in breast and axilla, PFS and OS rates were 100% (95% CI, inestimable). In patients without pCR, PFS rate was 76% (95% CI, 57% to 88%; P = .15, log-rank test), and OS rate was 83% (95% CI, 66% to 92%; P = .21). Survival rates were similar regardless of FISH status. There were only two grade 4 adverse events.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Twelve weeks of docetaxel, cisplatin, and trastuzumab is clinically active and leads to excellent survival in patients with large, HER2-positive tumors.",

        "Methods": "207 women with stage I-II breast cancer who underwent BCS were treated by 50 Gy irradiation to the whole breast and then randomly assigned to receive either a boost to the tumor bed (n = 104) or no further radiotherapy (n = 103). Boost treatments consisted of either 16 Gy electron irradiation (n = 52) or 12-14,25 Gy HDR BT (n = 52). Breast cancer-related events, side effects, and cosmetic results were assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the crude rate of local recurrences was 6.7% (7/104) with and 15.5% (16/103) without boost. The 5-year probability of LTC, relapse-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 92.7% vs. 84.9% (p = 0.049), 76.6% vs. 66.2% (p = 0.044), and 90.4% vs. 82.1% (p = 0.053), respectively. There was no significant difference in LTC between patients treated with electron or HDR BT boost (94.2% vs. 91.4%; p = 0.74). On multivariate analysis, patient age < 40 years (RR: 4.53), positive margin status (RR: 4.17), and high mitotic activity index (RR: 3.60) were found to be significant risk factors for local recurrence. The incidence of grade 2-3 side effects was higher in the boost arm (17.3% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.03). However, the rate of excellent/good cosmetic results was similar for the two arms (85.6% vs 91.3%; p = 0.14). Cosmesis was rated as excellent/good in 88.5% of patients treated with HDR BT and 82.7% of patients with electron boost (p = 0.29).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Boost dose significantly improves LTC and RFS in patients treated with BCS and radiotherapy. In spite of the higher incidence of late side effects in the boost arm, boost dose is strongly recommended for patients at high risk for local recurrence. Positive or close margin status, high mitotic activity index, and young patient age should be viewed as absolute indications for tumor bed boost. LTC and cosmesis are excellent and similar to patients boosted with either HDR BT or electrons.",

        "Methods": "Patients with stage IIB or III breast cancer, including inflammatory disease, and HER2 overexpression (determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization) were treated with six cycles of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 and vinorelbine 45 mg/m2 administered every 14 days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and quinolone prophylaxis. Trastuzumab was administered as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 31 enrolled patients, 68% had T3 or T4 tumors and 90% were clinically node positive. Twelve patients (39%; 95% CI, 21.6% to 55.9%) achieved pCR in the breast and lymph nodes and 14 patients (45%; 95% CI, 27.6% to 62.7%) achieved pCR in the breast alone, and 19 patients (61%; 95% CI, 44.1% to 78.4%) were node negative after neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical response was documented in 29 patients (94%; 95% CI, 78.6% to 99.2%) with 26 complete responses (84%; 95% CI, 70.9% to 96.8%). The most commonly reported grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (97%), febrile neutropenia (22%), anemia (6%), mucositis/stomatitis (6%), constipation (6%), and skin rash (6%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With clinical response and pCR rates of 94% and 39%, respectively, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and trastuzumab is a highly active neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-overexpressing locally advanced breast cancer. Although well tolerated overall, significant febrile neutropenia was observed despite prophylactic measures; therefore, evaluating a similar regimen using lower docetaxel and/or vinorelbine doses is warranted.",

        "Methods": "We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent mastectomy plus autologous tissue or expander/implant reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed in each group to evaluate for risk factors for complications. A complication was considered major if it required reoperation. A predictive model was used to compare the 2 groups to one another.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1037 patients were included in the study. In the tissue expander/implant population, there was a total complication rate of 31.8% and overall major complication rate of 24.4%. Radiation increased the major complication rate from 21.2 to 45.4%. However, 70.1% of the radiated patients ultimately had a successful implant-based reconstruction while an additional 10.3% went on to have autologous reconstruction. Age and body mass index (BMI) > 30 also led to higher major complication rates in tissue expander/implant reconstruction while smoking, hypertension, and chemotherapy had no impact. In the autologous reconstruction group, there was a total complication rate of 31.5% and a major complication rate of 19.7%. There was no statistically significant difference between the radiated and nonradiated autologous tissue reconstructions with major complication rates of 17.9 and 20.5%, respectively. BMI > 30 was the only significant factor leading to higher major complications in the autologous reconstructions.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Total complication rates were similar between tissue expander and autologous reconstructions. Increased major complication rates in patients with tissue expander reconstructions occurred in those with radiation, but was still successful in the majority of patients. Radiation had no influence on autologous tissue reconstruction major complication rates.",

Patients were followed from the initial diagnosis of cancer until contralateral mastectomy, contralateral breast cancer, death, or last follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "The actuarial risk of contralateral breast cancer was 29.5% at 10 years. Factors that were predictive of a reduced risk were the presence of a BRCA2 mutation (v BRCA1 mutation; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.15); age 50 years or older at first diagnosis (v <or= 49 years; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.10); use of tamoxifen (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.01); and history of oophorectomy (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.91).

The guideline was reviewed by selected experts and approved by the board of directors for both organizations.",
        "Results/Findings": "Approximately 20% of current HER2 testing may be inaccurate.

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The panel recommends that HER2 status should be determined for all invasive breast cancer. A testing algorithm that relies on accurate, reproducible assay performance, including newly available types of brightfield ISH, is proposed. Elements to reliably reduce assay variation (for example, specimen handling, assay exclusion, and reporting criteria) are specified. An algorithm defining positive, equivocal, and negative values for both HER2 protein expression and gene amplification is recommended: a positive HER2 result is IHC staining of 3+ (uniform, intense membrane staining of > 30% of invasive tumor cells), a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) result of more than six HER2 gene copies per nucleus or a FISH ratio (HER2 gene signals to chromosome 17 signals) of more than 2.2; a negative result is an IHC staining of 0 or 1+, a FISH result of less than 4.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or FISH ratio of less than 1.8. Equivocal results require additional action for final determination. It is recommended that to perform HER2 testing, laboratories show 95% concordance with another validated test for positive and negative assay values. The panel strongly recommends validation of laboratory assay or modifications, use of standardized operating procedures, and compliance with new testing criteria to be monitored with the use of stringent laboratory accreditation standards, proficiency testing, and competency assessment. The panel recommends that HER2 testing be done in a CAP-accredited laboratory or in a laboratory that meets the accreditation and proficiency testing requirements set out by this document.",

The panel developed a guideline for clinicians and patients regarding the appropriate use of a sentinel lymph node identification and sampling procedure from hereon referred to as SNB. The guideline was reviewed by selected experts in the field and the ASCO Health Services Committee and was approved by the ASCO Board of Directors.",
        "Results/Findings": "The literature review identified one published prospective randomized controlled trial in which SNB was compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), four limited meta-analyses, and 69 published single-institution and multicenter trials in which the test performance of SNB was evaluated with respect to the results of ALND (completion axillary dissection). There are currently no data on the effect of SLN biopsy on long-term survival of patients with breast cancer. However, a review of the available evidence demonstrates that, when performed by experienced clinicians, SNB appears to be a safe and acceptably accurate method for identifying early-stage breast cancer without involvement of the axillary lymph nodes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SNB is an appropriate initial alternative to routine staging ALND for patients with early-stage breast cancer with clinically negative axillary nodes. Completion ALND remains standard treatment for patients with axillary metastases identified on SNB. Appropriately identified patients with negative results of SNB, when done under the direction of an experienced surgeon, need not have completion ALND. Isolated cancer cells detected by pathologic examination of the SLN with use of specialized techniques are currently of unknown clinical significance. Although such specialized techniques are often used, they are not a required part of SLN evaluation for breast cancer at this time. Data suggest that SNB is associated with less morbidity than ALND, but the comparative effects of these two approaches on tumor recurrence or patient survival are unknown.",

At 10 years, 98% of patients receiving TamRT (95% CI, 96% to 99%) compared with 90% of those receiving Tam (95% CI, 85% to 93%) were free from local and regional recurrences. There were no significant differences in time to mastectomy, time to distant metastasis, breast cancer-specific survival, or OS between the two groups.

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With long-term follow-up, the previously observed small improvement in locoregional recurrence with the addition of radiation therapy remains. However, this does not translate into an advantage in OS, distant disease-free survival, or breast preservation.

There was no evidence that the relative effect of a boost on local control depends on age (P=0.97) However in younger patients the 5-year local failure was higher, therefore the absolute reduction was greater. If the threshold-age for boost treatment were set at 40 years, 8.4% of the study population would receive a boost, resulting in a 5-year local failure of 6.1% in the study population.

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In younger patients a boost dose resulted in a greater absolute reduction of local failure. The relative risk reduction was however similar for all ages. Applying a treatment policy with a threshold-age of 60 would result in 0.6% increase in local failure in the total study population, while sparing the boost to 1/3 of the patients.",

        "Methods": "A secondary analysis of a prospective database of patients with breast cancer undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) for FP by oocyte or embryo cryopreservation was performed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 154 patients, 93 met the inclusion criteria (mean age, 35.2 ± 4.4 years). Thirty-five of the 93 patients were referred before breast surgery (PreS), and 58 patients were referred after surgery (PostS). The time periods from initial diagnosis (ID) to initiation of OS (42.6 ± 27.7 days for PreS v 71.9 ± 30.7 days for PostS; P < .001) and from ID to initiation of chemotherapy (83.9 ± 24.3 days for PreS v 107.8 ± 42.9 days for PostS; P = .045) were significantly shorter for the PreS group versus the PostS group. Nine (25.7%) of 35 patients in the PreS group versus one (1.7%) of 58 patients in the PostS group were able to undergo two FP cycles (P < .001), resulting in an increased yield of oocytes in the PreS group (18.2% [93 of 511 oocytes] v 0.6% [five of 800 oocytes], respectively; P < .001) and embryos (17.2% [40 of 233 embryos] v 0.6% [two of 357 embryos], respectively; P < .001). Patients who had an oocyte retrieval within 5 weeks of the surgery were able to complete a second cycle within 9 weeks of the surgery.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FP referral before breast surgery enables earlier initiation of cryopreservation cycles and chemotherapy and, when appropriate, multiple FP cycles. Women who can undergo multiple cycles may be at advantage for FP because of a larger number of oocytes or embryos cryopreserved. This is the first study demonstrating the benefit of early FP referral in patients with cancer.",

        "Methods": "This study is a post-trial follow-up of the ASTRRA trial, involving 1,483 premenopausal women younger than 45 years treated with definitive surgery after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to complete 5 years of tamoxifen (TAM) alone (TAM-only) or 5 years of TAM with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for 2 years (TAM + OFS). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary end point was overall survival (OS).",
        "Results/Findings": "At 106.4 months of median follow-up, there was a continuous significant reduction in the DFS event rate in the TAM + OFS group. The 8-year DFS rate was 85.4% in the TAM + OFS group and 80.2% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87). There were no significant differences in OS between the two groups. The OS rate was 96.5% in the TAM + OFS group and 95.3% in the TAM-only group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.25).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adding OFS for 2 years to adjuvant TAM with a longer follow-up resulted in consistent DFS benefits, suggesting that adding OFS to TAM should be considered for patients who remain in a premenopausal state or resume ovarian function after chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "A total of 59 patients from 6 participating centers in Japan entered onto the study of trastuzumab and capecitabine. Eighty six percent of women had received prior chemotherapy as part of adjuvant (21.4%) or metastatic treatment (48.2%), or both (16.1%), including substantial portions of patients who had previously received either CMF (7.1%), anthracyclines (28.6%), taxanes (25.0%), or both types (25.0%) of chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "Responses were observed in 28 of 56 patients (overall response rate, 50%). The response rate was 65.0% in patients treated with trastuzumab and capecitabine as first-line therapy for metastatic disease, and 62.5% among HER2 +3 positive patients, while high response rates were also seen in women treated with second- or third-line therapy. Patients receiving trastuzumab and capecitabine as first-line therapy had a longer TTP than did patients receiving this treatment as second- or third-line therapy (median TTP, 280 vs. 130 days, P < 0.05). Further, patients receiving trastuzumab and capecitabine as first-line therapy had longer OS than did patients receiving this treatment as second- or third-line therapy (median OS, 780 days vs. 480 weeks, P < 0.05). The treatment-related adverse events were hand-foot syndrome (30.4%), nausea (25%), diarrhea (10.7%), stomatitis (10.7%), fatigue (7.1%), and vomiting (5.4%). However, the majority were Grade 1-2 adverse events and only six patients experienced Grade 3 adverse events. Further Grade 1 cardiac toxicity was observed in one patient, while there were no cases of alopecia and treatment-related death.",

        "Methods": "Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were retrospectively collected from patients in the monotherapy arms of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial and centrally tested for ER, PgR and HER-2. ER and PgR were scored using continuous scales and HER-2 was scored as 0 to 3+ with 2+ cases being analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.",
        "Results/Findings": "Blocks were collected from 2,006 of 5,880 eligible patients. Tissue was assessable and ER and/or PgR positivity confirmed centrally in 1,782 cases. In these, TTR was longer for anastrozole than for tamoxifen by a similar extent to that in the overall trial. None of the three biomarkers identified a set of patients with differential benefit from anastrozole over tamoxifen. Patients with low ER, low PgR, and high HER-2 expression had a poorer prognosis with either drug. Only 2.6% of patients in the highest quartile of PgR experienced recurrence after 5 years, compared with 13.2% in the lowest quartile.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Quantitative expression of ER and PgR and HER-2 status did not identify patients with differential relative benefit from anastrozole over tamoxifen: TTR was longer for anastrozole than for tamoxifen in all molecular subgroups.

Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) plus endocrine subscale (ES) at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, or until disease recurrence. The primary end point was the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index (TOI). The secondary end point was the ES total score. Analyses of individual endocrine symptoms were also explored.",
        "Results/Findings": "Questionnaire completion approximated 85% of assessments available for analysis. Overall QoL for all groups improved from baseline during the 2-year period. There were no significant differences in TOI or ES scores across treatment groups. Endocrine symptoms increased between baseline and 3 months for all groups and stabilized thereafter. There were some small differences in side effect profiles. Compared with patients receiving tamoxifen only, patients receiving anastrozole only reported significantly fewer cold sweats and vaginal discharge, yet more vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, and loss of sexual interest.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Two years of treatment with anastrozole, tamoxifen, or the combination had a similar overall QoL impact, showing gradual improvement over time. Endocrine-related symptoms for all three arms worsened initially and recovered partially during 2 years. The different symptoms experienced may assist in decision making about treatment and supportive care needs.",

Treatment consisted of: neoadjuvant MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) until a maximum response had been achieved; modified radical mastectomy; 6 courses of postoperative adjuvant MVAC chemotherapy, and chest wall irradiation (CWXRT). Multivariate analysis of locoregional response and overall survival was done.",

Chest wall doses ranged from 45 Gy to 50.4 Gy to the whole chest wall, with 31 patients receiving an additional chest-wall boost. The incidence of locoregional relapse with and without radiation was 7% vs. 31%, respectively (p = 0.026). An overall survival benefit was seen in those receiving radiation, with a mean overall survival of 50 months vs. 20 months, and a 3-year overall survival of 88% vs. 46% with and without radiation, respectively (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that overall survival was affected by the presence of pathological CR (p = .047), the number of pre-operative chemotherapy cycles (p = .036) and whether or not they received radiation (p = 0.003). Neither the interval between surgery and radiation, technique of radiation, nor radiation modality significantly affected local control.",

After the adjustment for the patient's age, tumor size, node status, and tumor grading, the AI treatment was linked to a 1.5-fold increase in risk of mortality compared to tamoxifen (HR 1.55; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.13; p = 0.007). The overall survival in male breast cancer was significantly better after adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen compared to an aromatase inhibitor. Tamoxifen should be considered as the treatment of choice for hormone-receptor-positive male breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To determine the activity of weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) by assessing response rate, survival, and safety.",
        "Methods": "One hundred patients with ABC received paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2) (group 1, n = 20) and carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2. Paclitaxel was subsequently reduced to 100 mg/m(2) (group 2, n = 80) because of toxicity. The median age was 58.5 years, and most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of <or= 2. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status were evenly distributed among both groups. Sixty-one patients received prior chemotherapy, 37 (61%) of whom received prior doxorubicin. Among 47 patients who received prior hormonal therapy, 43 received tamoxifen.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall response rate (ORR) among 95 assessable patients was 62%, including 8% complete responses and 54% partial responses. The median time to response was 1.8 months, and the median duration of response was 13.3 months. The median time to progression was 4.8 months. The median survival was 16 months. Neutropenia and leukopenia were the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities. In group 1, neutropenia (50%) and leukopenia (35%) necessitated dose reductions for 50% of patients during the first three cycles, prompting the reduction in paclitaxel dose to 100 mg/m(2). Grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities for all patients included peripheral neuropathy (11%), infection (6%), anemia (5%), weakness (6%), and paresthesia (3%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The 62% ORR achieved with weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin is among the highest achieved with chemotherapy for ABC. This high response rate and the lack of cardiotoxicity suggest that the regimen should be considered as a nonanthracycline regimen for future adjuvant therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To determine the accuracy of positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG-PET) in detecting axillary nodal metastases in women with primary breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "In this prospective multicenter study, 360 women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer underwent FDG-PET. Images were blindly interpreted by three experienced readers for abnormally increased axillary FDG uptake. Imaging results from 308 assessable axillae were compared with axillary node pathology.",
        "Results/Findings": "For detecting axillary nodal metastasis, the mean estimated area under the receiver operator curve for the three readers was 0.74 (range, 0.70 to 0.76). If at least one probably or definitely abnormal axillary focus was considered positive, the mean (and range) sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PET were 61% (54% to 67%), 80% (79% to 81%), 62% (60% to 64%), and 79% (76% to 81%), respectively. False-negative axillae on PET had significantly smaller and fewer tumor-positive lymph nodes (2.7) than true-positive axillae (5.1; P <.005). Semiquantitative analysis of axillary FDG uptake showed that a nodal standardized uptake value (lean body mass) more than 1.8 had a positive predictive value of 90%, but a sensitivity of only 32%. Finding two or more intense foci of tracer uptake in the axilla was highly predictive of axillary metastasis (78% to 83% positive predictive value), albeit insensitive (27%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FDG-PET has moderate accuracy for detecting axillary metastasis but often fails to detect axillae with small and few nodal metastases. Although highly predictive for nodal tumor involvement when multiple intense foci of tracer uptake are identified, FDG-PET is not routinely recommended for axillary staging of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "A total of 4,954 eligible women with stage II to III breast cancer treated with four cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel or docetaxel every 3 weeks for four doses or weekly for 12 doses using a 2 × 2 factorial design. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). Results are expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards models. All P values are two sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "When compared with the standard every-3-week paclitaxel arm, after a median follow-up of 12.1 years, DFS significantly improved and overall survival (OS) marginally improved only for the weekly paclitaxel (HR, 0.84; P = .011 and HR, 0.87; P = .09, respectively) and every-3-week docetaxel arms (HR, 0.79; P = .001 and HR, 0.86; P = .054, respectively). Weekly paclitaxel improved DFS and OS (HR, 0.69; P = .010 and HR, 0.69; P = .019, respectively) in triple-negative breast cancer. For hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-nonoverexpressing disease, no experimental arm improved OS, and black race and obesity were associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and death.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Improved outcomes initially observed for weekly paclitaxel were qualitatively similar but quantitatively less pronounced with longer follow-up, although exploratory analysis suggested substantial benefit in triple-negative disease.

Curative intent was defined as delivery of more than four cycles of anthracycline-based CT plus locoregional RT in patients without distant metastases.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up among survivors was 6.5 years. Median BCSS was 1.0 and 3.2 years for patients with distant metastases at diagnosis or those who were curatively treated, respectively. Among patients treated curatively (n = 308), there were no significant differences in LRFS or BCSS with timing of Mx before or after CT/RT, time between diagnosis and RT, or the sequence of RT and CT. Patients receiving more intensive CT had improved 10-year BCSS compared with standard CT (43.7% v 26.3%; P = .04). Ten-year LRFS for patients having Mx after CT, Mx before CT, and without Mx was 62.8%, 58.6%, and 34.4%, respectively (P = .0001); the corresponding 10-year BCSS was 36.9%, 19.9%, and 22.5%, respectively (P = .005). On multivariate analysis, Mx was associated with improved LRFS (P = .04). Independent prognostic factors for BCSS were menopausal status (P = .02), estrogen receptor status (P = .02), and CT type (P = .05).",

        "Methods": "Between 1986 and 1992, 1,024 women with early breast carcinoma (< or = 3 cm in diameter) were treated by local excision, axillary dissection, and conventional 50-Gy irradiation given in 20 fractions over 5 weeks and then randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment or a boost of 10 Gy by electrons to the tumor bed. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years as of September 1994. The occurrence of telangiectasia was reported, and the patients were asked to evaluate the cosmetic result.",
        "Results/Findings": "At 5 years, 10 patients of 521 who had received the boost (Kaplan-Meier estimate of local relapse rate, 3.6%) and 20 of 503 who had received no further treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimate of local relapse rate, 4.5%) had developed a local recurrence (P = .044). After adjustment for the main prognostic variables, the relative risk was still significantly lower for the boost group (0.3; range, 0.12 to 0.95). The boost group had a higher rate of grade 1 and 2 telangiectasia (12.4% v 5.9%), but no difference was seen between the two treatment arms in the self-assessment score for the cosmetic result.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Delivery of a boost of 10 Gy to the tumor bed after 50 Gy to the whole breast following limited surgery significantly reduces the risk of early local recurrence, with no serious deterioration in the cosmetic result.

        "Methods": "Data submitted to the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group were used in separate meta-analyses of two cohorts. Primary analyses involve postmenopausal women with tumors reported to be estrogen receptor positive. Log-rank P values are two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Cohort 1 comprised 9,856 patients with a mean of 5.8 years of follow-up. At 5 years, AI therapy was associated with an absolute 2.9% (SE = 0.7%) decrease in recurrence (9.6% for AI v 12.6% for tamoxifen; 2P < .00001) and a nonsignificant absolute 1.1% (SE = 0.5%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (4.8% for AI v 5.9% for tamoxifen; 2P = .1). Cohort 2 comprised 9,015 patients with a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up. At 3 years from treatment divergence (ie, approximately 5 years after starting hormonal treatment), AI therapy was associated with an absolute 3.1% (SE = 0.6%) decrease in recurrence (5.0% for AI v 8.1% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P < .00001) and an absolute 0.7% (SE = 0.3%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (1.7% for AI v 2.4% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P = .02). There was no convincing heterogeneity in the proportional recurrence reduction with respect to age, nodal status, tumor grade, or progesterone receptor status and no indication of an increase in nonbreast deaths with AIs in either cohort. CONCLUSION AIs produce significantly lower recurrence rates compared with tamoxifen, either as initial monotherapy or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. Additional follow-up will provide clearer information on long-term survival.",

Patients had advanced or metastatic breast cancer with evidence of disease progression while receiving continuous adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, had experienced relapse within 12 months of stopping adjuvant antiestrogen therapy given for at least 6 months, or had experienced disease progression while receiving antiestrogen therapy for advanced disease. Tumors were required to be estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive or of unknown status. Confirmed objective response rate was the primary efficacy variable. Karnofsky Performance Status and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life assessments were collected for 1 year.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were no statistically significant differences among the three treatment groups for overall objective tumor response. Patients treated with letrozole 0.5 mg had improvements in disease progression (P =.044) and a decreased risk of treatment failure (P =.018), compared with patients treated with megestrol acetate. Letrozole 0.5 mg showed a trend (P =.053) for survival benefit when compared with megestrol acetate. Megestrol acetate was more likely to produce weight gain, dyspnea, and vaginal bleeding, and the letrozole groups were more likely to experience headache, hair thinning, and diarrhea.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Given a favorable tolerability profile, once-daily dosing, and evidence of clinically relevant benefit, letrozole is equivalent to megestrol acetate and should be considered for use as an alternative treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women after treatment failure with antiestrogens.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To compare the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant (formerly ICI 182,780) and anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing after prior endocrine treatment.",
        "Methods": "Patients (n = 451) with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive fulvestrant 250 mg as a once-monthly (one x 5 mL) intramuscular injection or an oral dose of anastrozole 1 mg in this open, parallel-group, multicenter trial. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rates, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients were followed for a median period of 14.4 months. In terms of TTP, fulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole (hazard ratio, 0.98; confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.21; P =.84). Median TTP was 5.5 months for fulvestrant and 5.1 months for anastrozole. OR rates showed a numerical advantage for fulvestrant (20.7%) over anastrozole (15.7%) (odds ratio, 1.38; CI, 0.84 to 2.29; P =.20). Clinical benefit rates (CR + PR + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 44.6% for fulvestrant and 45.0% for anastrozole. Median DOR was 14.3 months for fulvestrant and 14.0 months for anastrozole. Both treatments were well tolerated, with 3.2% and 1.3% of fulvestrant- and anastrozole-treated patients, respectively, withdrawn from treatment because of an adverse event.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Fulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole. These data confirm that fulvestrant is an additional, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease progressed on prior endocrine therapy.",

The primary end points were time to progression (TTP), objective response (OR), and tolerability.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 668 patients (340 in the anastrozole arm and 328 in the tamoxifen arm) were randomized to treatment and followed-up for a median of 19 months. Median TTP was similar for both treatments (8.2 months in patients who received anastrozole and 8.3 months in patients who received tamoxifen). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 0.99 (lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 0.86), demonstrating that anastrozole was at least equivalent to tamoxifen. Anastrozole was also as effective as tamoxifen in terms of OR (32.9% of anastrozole and 32.6% of tamoxifen patients achieved a complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Clinical benefit (CR + PR + stabilization of > or = 24 weeks) rates were 56.2% and 55.5% for patients receiving anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated. However, incidences of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (4.8% v 7.3% [thromboembolic events] and 1.2% v 2.4% [vaginal bleeding], respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole satisfied the predefined criteria for equivalence to tamoxifen. Together with the lower observed incidence of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding, these findings indicate that anastrozole should be considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with ABC.",

        "Methods": "Two randomized, double-blind for anastrozole, open-label for megestrol acetate, parallel-group, multicenter trials were conducted in 764 patients. Because both trials were identical in design, an analysis of the combined results was performed to strengthen interpretation of results from each trial.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up duration was approximately 6 months. The estimated progression hazards ratios were 0.97 (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.24) for anastrozole 1 mg versus megestrol acetate and 0.92 (97.5% CI, 0.71 to 1.19) for anastrozole 10 mg versus megestrol acetate. The overall median time to progression was approximately 21 weeks. Approximately one third of patients in each group benefited from treatment. Twenty-seven patients (10.3%) in the anastrozole 1-mg group, 22 (8.9%) in the anastrozole 10-mg group, and 20 (7.9%) in the megestrol acetate group had a complete or partial response, and 66 (25.1%), 56 (22.6%), and 66 (26.1%) patients, respectively, had stable disease for > or = 24 weeks. For all end points, individual trial results were similar to the results of the combined analysis. Anastrozole and megestrol acetate were well tolerated. Gastrointestinal disturbance was more common among patients in the anastrozole groups than the megestrol acetate group; the difference between the anastrozole 10 mg and megestrol acetate groups was significant (P = .005). Significantly fewer patients in the anastrozole 1-mg (P < .0001) and 10-mg (P < .002) groups had weight gain than in the megestrol acetate group. More than 30% of megestrol acetate-treated patients had weight gain > or = 5%, and 10% of patients had weight gain > or = 10%. Patients who received megestrol acetate continued to gain weight over time.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole, 1 and 10 mg once daily, is well tolerated and as effective as megestrol acetate in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who progressed following tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, anastrozole therapy avoids the weight gain associated with megestrol acetate treatment.",

        "Background/Purpose": "To compare a full-dose epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (HEC) regimen with classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) therapy and with a moderate-dose epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen (EC) in the adjuvant therapy of node-positive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Node-positive breast cancer patients who were aged 70 years or younger were randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: CMF for six cycles (oral cyclophosphamide); EC for eight cycles (epirubicin 60 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2); day 1 every 3 weeks); and HEC for eight cycles (epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 830 mg/m(2); day 1 every 3 weeks).",
        "Results/Findings": "Two hundred fifty-five, 267, and 255 eligible patients were treated with CMF, EC, and HEC, respectively. Patient characteristics were well balanced among the three arms. One and three cases of congestive heart failure were reported in the EC and HEC arms, respectively. Three cases of acute myeloid leukemia were reported in the HEC arm. After 4 years of median follow-up, no statistically significant differences were observed between HEC and CMF (event-free survival [EFS]: hazards ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.31, P =.80; distant-EFS: HR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.34, P =.87; overall survival [OS]: HR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.44, P =.87). HEC is more effective than EC (EFS: HR = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99, P =.04; distant-EFS: HR = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.02, P =.06; OS HR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.00, P =.05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This three-arm study does not show an advantage in favor of an adequately dosed epirubicin-based regimen over classical CMF in the adjuvant therapy of node-positive pre- and postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Moreover, this study confirms that there is a dose-response curve for epirubicin in breast cancer adjuvant therapy.",

        "Methods": "Three hundred seventy-two women with breast cancer who had at least one lytic bone lesion and who were receiving hormonal therapy were randomized to receive 90 mg of pamidronate or placebo as a 2-hour intravenous infusion given in double-blind fashion every 4 weeks for 24 cycles. Patients were evaluated for skeletal complications: pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, irradiation of or surgery on bone, or hypercalcemia. The skeletal morbidity rate (the ratio of the number of skeletal complications to the time on trial) was the primary efficacy variable. Bone pain, use of analgesics, quality of life, performance status, bone tumor response, and biochemical parameters were also evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "One hundred eighty-two patients who received pamidronate and 189 who received placebo were assessable. The skeletal morbidity rate was significantly reduced at 12, 18, and 24 cycles in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate (P = .028, .023, and .008, respectively). At 24 cycles, the proportion of patients having had any skeletal complication was 56% in the pamidronate group and 67% in the placebo group (P = .027). The time to the first skeletal complication was longer for patients receiving pamidronate than for those given placebo (P = .049). There was no statistical difference in survival or in objective bone response rate. Pamidronate was well tolerated.",

A matched cohort was selected by using variables of hormone receptor status, age, and year of surgery. We estimated rates of local and distant recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in the two groups.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 150 consecutive patients with pT1a-b, pN0, HER2-positive tumors. No patient received adjuvant trastuzumab. The median follow-up was 4.6 years (range, 1.0 to 9.0 years). In the hormone receptor-positive group, 5-year DFS rates were 99% (95% CI, 96% to 100%) for HER2-negative disease and 92% (95% CI, 86% to 99%) for HER2-positive disease. In the hormone receptor-negative group, 5-year DFS rates were 92% (95% CI, 84% to 100%) for HER2-negative disease and 91% (95% CI, 84% to 99%) for HER2-positive disease. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) associated with HER2 overexpression was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.9 to 6.5; P = .09). After analysis was adjusted for pT1 stage, hormone receptor-positive disease with HER2-positive status was associated with a worse prognosis (HR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 25.7). OS in HER2-positive, pT1a-b, pN0 breast cancer was similar irrespective of the hormone receptor status (P = .93).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with node-negative, HER2 positive, pT1a-b breast cancer have a low risk of recurrence at 5 years of follow-up. In patients with hormone receptor-positive disease and pT1a-b, N0 tumors, HER2 overexpression was associated with a worse DFS.",

        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up after RT was 8.6 years for both groups. The pathologic T and N stage, race, estrogen and progesterone status, number of positive nodes, and RT were comparable between the two groups (all P >/= .08). More women age 49 years or younger and women who received chemotherapy were in the sequential group than the concurrent group (6% and 25%, respectively; P < .0001). The sequence of tamoxifen therapy did not influence 10-year local recurrence rates (sequential, 7%; concurrent, 3%; P = .52), overall survival (sequential, 86%; concurrent, 81%; P = .64), or relapse-free survival (sequential, 76%; concurrent, 85%; P = .35). When adjusting age and chemotherapy use in the multivariable Cox model, hazard ratios comparing sequential versus concurrent tamoxifen therapy were 1.56 (95% CI, 0.87 to 2.79), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.63 to 2.41), and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.33 to 4.49) for the overall survival, relapse-free survival, and local recurrence, respectively.",

Patients have HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive MBC/LABC and no prior systemic therapy with the exception of endocrine. Random assignment was 1:1 to intravenous pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks), and oral anastrozole (1 mg every day) or letrozole (2.5 mg every day), or trastuzumab and an AI. Induction intravenous docetaxel every 3 weeks or paclitaxel every week could be administered for 18 to 24 weeks at the investigator's discretion (decided before but given after random assignment).

        "Background/Purpose": "To analyze the stage-specific management of male breast cancer (MBC) with surgery and radiation therapy (RT) and relate them to outcomes and to female breast cancer (FBC).",
        "Methods": "The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for all primary invasive MBC and FBC diagnosed from 1973 to 2008. Analyzable data included age, race, registry, grade, stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, type of surgery, and use of RT. Stage was defined as localized (LocD): confined to the breast; regional (RegD): involving skin, chest wall, and/or regional lymph nodes; and distant: M1. The primary endpoint was cause-specific survival (CSS).",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 4276 cases of MBC and 718,587 cases of FBC were identified. Male breast cancer constituted 0.6% of all breast cancer. Comparing MBC with FBC, mastectomy (M) was used in 87.4% versus 38.3%, and breast-conserving surgery in 12.6% versus 52.6% (P<10(-4)). For males with LocD, CSS was not significantly different for the 4.6% treated with lumpectomy/RT versus the 70% treated with M alone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-3.61; P=.57). Postmastectomy RT was delivered in 33% of males with RegD and was not associated with an improvement in CSS (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.88-1.41; P=.37). There was a significant increase in the use of postmastectomy RT in MBC over time: 24.3%, 27.2%, and 36.8% for 1973-1987, 1988-1997, and 1998-2008, respectively (P<.0001). Cause-specific survival for MBC has improved: the largest significant change was identified for men diagnosed in 1998-2008 compared with 1973-1987 (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; P=.0004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Surgical management of MBC is dramatically different than for FBC. The majority of males with LocD receive M despite equivalent CSS with lumpectomy/RT. Postmastectomy RT is greatly underutilized in MBC with RegD, although a CSS benefit was not demonstrated. Outcomes for MBC are improving, attributable to improved therapy and its use in this unscreened population.",

        "Methods": "In EORTC trial 22881/10882, 5569 early-stage breast cancer patients were treated with tumorectomy and axillary dissection, followed by tangential fields irradiation of the breast to a dose of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, at 2 Gy per fraction. A total of 5318 patients, having a microscopically complete tumorectomy, were randomized between no further treatment and a boost of 16 Gy to the primary tumor bed. The cosmetic result at 3-year follow-up was assessed by a panel for 731 patients, and by digitizer measurements, measuring the displacement of the nipple, for 1141 patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the correlation between various patient, tumor, and treatment factors and cosmesis.",
        "Results/Findings": "The factors associated with a worsened cosmesis according to the panel evaluation were: an inferior tumor location, a large excision volume, the presence of postoperative breast complications, and the radiotherapy boost. According to the digitizer measurements, a central/superior tumor location, a large excision volume, an increased pathological tumor size, an increased radiation dose inhomogeneity, and an increased bra cup size resulted in an increased asymmetry in nipple position. It appeared that the evaluation of the nipple position (whether by panel or by digitizer) is only moderately representative of the overall cosmetic outcome.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "To achieve a good cosmesis, it is necessary to excise the tumor with a limited margin, to avoid postoperative complications, to assess the need for a boost in the individual patient, and to give the radiation dose as homogeneously as possible. As far as the method of evaluation is concerned, the panel evaluation is the most appropriate method for giving an overall impression of the cosmetic result after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). The use of the digitizer is recommended for comparing the cosmetic outcome of two different approaches to BCT or for analyzing cosmetic changes over time.",

HER2 status changed in hormone receptor-positive BC more frequently than in negative ones (P = 0.002). In addition, we evaluated HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy number by SISH in the 123 cases with unchanged HER2 status during progression. We found consistent HER2 gene copy number stability in the 100 nonamplified cases. Conversely, of the 23 amplified PBC, 13 (57%) demonstrated a significant increase in the HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy number in their paired metastases (P = 0.01), as defined by SISH (k = 0.54, P < 0.0001) and MLPA.

OS at 3 years for MBC and FBC was 85.6% and 90.4%, respectively (P=0.0002). MBC were more ductal, had higher grade, presented with more advanced stage and were often HR+/HER2- (each P<0.0001). MBC had worse OS than FBC in HR+/HER2- (Hazard ratio [HaR], 1.5; P=0.0005), HR+/HER2+ (HaR, 2.8; P<0.0001) and triple negative (HaR, 4.3; P<0.0001) (Pinteraction<0.02). MBC had significantly worse OS than FBC in stages I and II, but similar OS in stages III and IV (Pinteraction<0.01). In multivariate analysis, HR+/HER2+ was the only subtype with significant differences in OS between MBC and FBC (HaR, 2.0; P=0.002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "OS was significantly different in both groups. Men had worse OS in early stages while similar OS in stages III and IV. There were significant differences in OS according to tumor subtype; compared with women, men with HR+/HER2+ tumors had twice the risk of death.",

        "Methods": "After surgical treatment, 3,121 women with operable breast cancer and involved lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive a combination of cyclophosphamide (C), 600 mg/m(2), with one of three doses of doxorubicin (A), 60, 75, or 90 mg/m(2), for four cycles followed by either no further therapy or four cycles of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m(2). Tamoxifen was given to 94% of patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no evidence of a doxorubicin dose effect. At 5 years, disease-free survival was 69%, 66%, and 67% for patients randomly assigned to 60, 75, and 90 mg/m(2), respectively. The hazard reductions from adding paclitaxel to CA were 17% for recurrence (adjusted Wald chi(2) P =.0023; unadjusted Wilcoxon P =.0011) and 18% for death (adjusted P =.0064; unadjusted P =.0098). At 5 years, the disease-free survival (+/- SE) was 65% (+/- 1) and 70% (+/- 1), and overall survival was 77% (+/- 1) and 80% (+/- 1) after CA alone or CA plus paclitaxel, respectively. The effects of adding paclitaxel were not significantly different in subsets defined by the protocol, but in an unplanned subset analysis, the hazard ratio of CA plus paclitaxel versus CA alone was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.86) for those with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and only 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.07) for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, almost all of whom received adjuvant tamoxifen. The additional toxicity from adding four cycles of paclitaxel was generally modest.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of four cycles of paclitaxel after the completion of a standard course of CA improves the disease-free and overall survival of patients with early breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "A retrospective review of records for patients enrolled onto any of seven phase II and III trastuzumab clinical trials was performed. Predefined criteria were used for the diagnosis, and the New York Heart Association functional classification system was used to document CD severity. Product-limit estimates were used to summarize the cumulative anthracycline and trastuzumab doses at the time of CD onset.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients treated with trastuzumab were found to be at an increased risk for CD. The incidence was greatest in patients receiving concomitant trastuzumab and anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (27%). The risk was substantially lower in patients receiving paclitaxel and trastuzumab (13%) or trastuzumab alone (3% to 7%); however, most of these patients had received prior anthracycline therapy. CD was noted in 8% of patients receiving anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide and 1% receiving paclitaxel alone.

Patients (n = 829) completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B+4) and the Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at baseline (pre-surgery) and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-surgery. There were significant differences between treatment groups favouring the SNB group throughout the 18 months assessment. Patients in the standard treatment group showed a greater decline in Trial Outcome Index (TOI) scores (physical well-being, functional well-being and breast cancer concerns subscales in FACT-B+4) and recovered more slowly than patients in the SNB group (p < 0.01). The change in total FACT-B+4 scores (measuring global QOL) closely resembled the TOI results. 18 months post-surgery approximately twice as many patients in the standard group compared with the SNB group reported substantial arm swelling (14% versus 7%) (p = 0.002) or numbness (19% versus 8.7%) (p < 0.001). Despite the uncertainty about undergoing a relatively new procedure and the possible need for further surgery, there was no evidence of increased anxiety amongst patients randomised to SNB (p > 0.05). For 6 months post-surgery younger patients reported less favourable QOL scores (p < 0.001) and greater levels of anxiety (p < 0.01). In view of the benefits regarding arm functioning and quality of life, the data from this randomised study support the use of SNB in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "One hundred fifty-seven patients with assessable advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had received no prior chemotherapy were entered onto the study. They were stratified into five groups according to the main assessable tumor target: lung, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and others. One hundred forty-five patients were assessable for toxicity and response using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria; the 12 patients who were not evaluated were excluded because they were found not to meet the eligibility criteria. Navelbine was administered as a weekly 30-mg/m2 short IV infusion, and treatment was continued until disease progression.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall response rate (WHO criteria) was 41% (complete response [CR], 7%; partial response [PR], 34%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 33% to 49%). In addition, 30% of the patients had stable disease. The response rate according to target was lymph nodes (28 of 42), 67%; liver (nine of 39), 23%; lung (10 of 30), 33%; skin (21 of 30), 70%; primary tumor (10 of 16), 56%; and bone (three of 10), 30%. The median time to treatment failure was 6 months and the median survival was 18 months. A total of 1,673 cycles were given to 145 eligible patients. At least one episode of WHO grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 72% of the patients. Nausea and/or vomiting, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia were seen in less than 1% of cycles. Other side effects were rare, and additional toxicities were documented in the following proportions of patients: grade 2 to 3 alopecia, 8%; infectious episodes, 6%; and peripheral neuropathy, 3%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our data confirm that Navelbine has major single-agent antitumor activity as front-line therapy in advanced breast cancer.

        "Methods": "Whole-body FDG-PET imaging was performed on 57 patients with a previous history of breast carcinoma who were referred for a clinical suspicion of disease recurrence. Whole-body PET images were scored from 1 (definitely negative) to 5 (definitely positive) by three independent observers, and discrepancies were resolved by a fourth observer. Patients were clinically followed for up to 24 mo to assess the accuracy of PET diagnosis by biopsy, follow-up imaging and other diagnostic tests.",
        "Results/Findings": "PET scans showed that there were 41 sites indicating recurrent or metastatic disease in 29 patients. There were 38 sites in 28 patients that showed no evidence for malignant disease. On a patient basis, with scores 4 or 5 considered to be positive, sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 79%, respectively. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 82% and 92%. On a lesion basis, with scores 4 or 5 considered to be positive, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity 79%. The area index in receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.91 for patient-based analysis and 0.88 for lesion-based analysis. To determine the cause for false-negative and false-positive findings more precisely, false-negative lesions with scores of 3 or lower and false-positive lesions with scores of 4 or higher were analyzed. Bone metastases had a significantly larger proportion of false-negative lesions than other nonosseous malignant sites (p < 0.05). False-positive lesions were due to muscle uptake (n = 5), inflammation (n = 4), blood pool activity in the great vessels (n = 2), bowel uptake (n = 1) and unknown causes (n = 6).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The whole-body FDG-PET scan is a useful diagnostic test for detecting recurrent or metastatic lesions of breast carcinoma. However, the sensitivity for metastases to bone appears to be lower than that to other organs. Specificity may be improved by more strict attention to patient preparation and better recognition of physiologic skeletal muscle or artifactual uptakes.",

        "Methods": "The study is a population-based retrospective review of infant birth and death certificates and maternal and neonatal discharge records. Cases of malignant neoplasms associated with obstetrical delivery were attributed to 1 of 3 categories, depending on the earliest documented hospital discharge diagnosis, as follows: \"prenatal\" if the diagnosis was first documented by hospitalization within 9 months preceding delivery, \"at delivery\" if the diagnosis was established from the delivery hospitalization, or \"postpartum\" if the diagnosis was first documented by hospitalization within 12 months after delivery.",
        "Results/Findings": "Computer-linked infant birth and death certificates and maternal and neonatal discharge records were used to identify cases and outcomes. Cases of malignant neoplasms were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (140-208). Noninvasive neoplasms and carcinoma in situ neoplasms were excluded. In analysis of outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel estimate for adjusted odds ratios was used.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among 3,168,911 obstetrical deliveries over the 6-year span, a total of 2247 cases of primary malignancy were identified. The observed rate of occurrence for primary malignant neoplasms was 0.71 per 1000 live singleton births. Most cases (53.3%) were first documented in the postpartum period as follows: prenatal, 587 cases (0.18 per 1000); at delivery, 462 cases (0.15 per 1000); and postpartum, 1198 cases (0.38 per 1000). The most frequently documented primary malignant neoplasms associated with obstetrical delivery were breast cancer (423 cases, 0.13 per 1000), thyroid cancer (389 cases, 0.12 per 1000), cervical cancer (266 cases, 0.08 per 1000), Hodgkin's disease (172 cases, 0.05 per 1000), and ovarian cancer (123 cases, 0.04 per 1000). Odds ratios for a variety of demographic factors identified maternal age as the most significant risk factor for development of malignant neoplasms (age greater than 40 vs 20-25, odds ratio 5.7, CI 4.6-6.9). Age-adjusted odds ratios for maternal cancer of any type suggested significantly elevated risks for cesarean delivery (odds ratio 1.4, CI 1.3-1.6), blood transfusion (odds ratio 6.2, CI 4.5-8.5), hysterectomy (odds ratio 27.4, CI 20.8-36.1), and maternal postpartum hospital stay greater than 5 days (odds ratio 30.6, CI 27.9-33.6), but not for postpartum maternal death (odds ratio 0.8, CI 0.6-1.0). Odds ratios also suggested significantly elevated risks for premature newborn (odds ratio 2.0, CI 1.8-2.2), very low birth weight (odds ratio 2.9, CI 2.2-3.8), and newborn hospital stay longer than 5 days (odds ratio 2.6, CI 2.4-3.0), but not for neonatal death (odds ratio 1.6, CI 0.8-3.1) or infant death (odds ratio 1.2, CI 0.5-3.3). However, several types of malignant neoplasms did confer significant elevations in risk for neonatal death. Hospital charges for both maternal and neonatal care were significantly elevated in the maternal malignant neoplasm group.",

        "Background/Purpose": "This report presents the results of a survival update based on the combined data from two studies that compared the efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole (1 or 10 mg once daily), a selective, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor administered orally, and megestrol acetate (40 mg 4 times daily) in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast carcinoma whose disease had progressed after treatment with tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "Two randomized, parallel-group, multicenter trials were conducted, involving a total of 764 patients. The two trials were identical in design; both were double blind for anastrozole and open label for megestrol acetate. Overview analyses were conducted with the intent of strengthening the interpretation of results from each trial. The median follow-up duration for this survival update was 31 months.",
        "Results/Findings": "At the clinical dose of 1 mg daily, anastrozole demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage over megestrol acetate, with a hazard ratio of 0.78 (P < 0.025)(0.60 < 97.5% confidence interval [CI] <1.0). The 1 mg anastrozole group also had a longer median time to death (26.7 months) compared with 22.5 months for the megestrol acetate group. The 10 mg anastrozole group also had a survival benefit over the megestrol acetate group, with a hazard ratio of 0.83 (P=0.09, not significant)(0.64 < 97.5% CI < 1.1). Higher 2-year survival rates were observed for both anastrozole treatment groups than for the megestrol acetate group (56.1%, 54.6%, and 46.3% for the groups given 1 mg anastrozole, 10 mg anastrozole, and megestrol acetate, respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This combined analysis of two trials of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast carcinoma has clearly demonstrated that, after disease progression with tamoxifen, treatment with anastrozole 1 mg once daily results in a statistically and clinically significant advantage over a standard treatment, megestrol acetate. This important benefit, in addition to the good tolerability profile of anastrozole, supports the use of this drug as a valuable new treatment option for this patient population.",

NVB patients also had significantly longer time to treatment failure than ALK patients, with a median 12 weeks versus 8 weeks, respectively (P < .001). The effect of NVB on survival was also statistically significant (P = .034): 1-year survival rates were 35.7% with NVB and 21.7% with ALK and the median survival rate was 35 weeks and 31 weeks, respectively. In total, 46.5% of NVB patients and 28.2% of ALK patients achieved an objective response or stabilization of disease (P = .06). No intergroup differences were noted in patient-assessed QL and cancer-related symptoms. The most common toxicities were hematologic, including granulocytopenia with NVB and thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia with ALK. Both drugs were generally well tolerated, and no septic deaths were reported.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This randomized trial demonstrates a survival benefit in anthracycline-refractory ABC. NVB was well tolerated and demonstrated activity superior to ALK in anthracycline-refractory ABC, without compromising QL. Based on activity of single-agent NVB in this difficult-to-treat patient population, investigations of NVB in combination with other anticancer drugs are warranted.",

        "Methods": "Patients were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to chemotherapy plus BV or chemotherapy plus placebo. Before random assignment, investigators chose capecitabine (Cape; 2,000 mg/m(2) for 14 days), taxane (Tax) -based (nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m(2)), or anthracycline (Anthra) -based (doxorubicin or epirubicin combinations [doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, or fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide]) chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. BV or placebo was administered at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), 1-year survival rate, objective response rate, duration of objective response, and safety. Two independently powered cohorts defined by the choice of chemotherapy (Cape patients or pooled Tax/Anthra patients) were analyzed in parallel.",
        "Results/Findings": "RIBBON-1 (Regimens in Bevacizumab for Breast Oncology) enrolled 1,237 patients (Cape cohort, n = 615; Tax/Anthra cohort, n = 622).

        "Background/Purpose": "This investigation was undertaken to assess the risk to the embryo/fetus associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymphoscintigraphy of the breast performed in pregnant patients. Approximately 92.5 MBq (2.5 mCi) of filtered Tc-99m sulfur colloid was injected peritumorally the day before surgery in two nonpregnant women with breast cancer. The whole-body distribution of the radiopharmaceutical was evaluated using a gamma camera 1 hour after injection. We then calculated the absorbed dose to the embryo/fetus for three theoretical extreme scenarios of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics: 1) all of the injected radiopharmaceutical remains in the breast and is eliminated only by physical decay; 2) all of the injected radiopharmaceutical is instantaneously transported to the urinary bladder, where it remains and is eliminated only by physical decay; and 3) the injected radiopharmaceutical behaves as though it were administered intravenously, that is, it has the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of Tc-99m sulfur colloid injected for a liver/spleen or bone marrow scan. The fetal radiation absorbed dose was then estimated for two Tc-99m dosages: 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) and 92.5 MBq (2.5 mCi). The Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD) program was used to estimate the absorbed doses to the embryo/fetus for the first two scenarios. Published data were used to calculate the doses for the third scenario. A single breast is not among the source organs in the MIRD program, so the heart was used as a surrogate in the first scenario. In the two breast cancer patients, whole-body gamma-camera images obtained 1 hour after radiopharmaceutical injection revealed no radioactivity except in the vicinity of the injection site. In the theoretical scenarios, with 92.5 MBq, the highest absorbed doses to the embryo/fetus were as follows: scenario 1, 7.74 x 10(-2) mGy at 9 months of pregnancy; scenario 2, 4.26 mGy during early pregnancy; and scenario 3, 0.342 mGy at 9 months of pregnancy. The maximum absorbed dose to the fetus of 4.3 mGy calculated for the worst-case scenario is well below the 50 mGy that is believed to be the threshold absorbed dose for adverse effects. Thus breast lymphoscintigraphy during pregnancy appears to present a very low risk to the embryo/fetus.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.",
        "Methods": "In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS. Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten). All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours. All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals. This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed). Median follow-up was 7·2 years (IQR 5·6-8·9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded. We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·64-1·23]). The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1·25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0·49). A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·58-1·50], p=0·78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other. The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments. Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.

        "Background/Purpose": "There is no consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin in patients receiving breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and postoperative radiation therapy (RT) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Inadequate margins may result in high local recurrence, and excessively large resections may lead to poor cosmetic outcome without oncologic benefit.",
        "Methods": "A comprehensive search for published trials that examined outcomes after adjuvant RT after BCS for DCIS was performed using MEDLINE and cross referencing available data. Reviews of each study were conducted, and data were extracted. Primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) related to surgical margins.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 4,660 patients were identified from trials examining BCS and RT for DCIS. Patients with negative margins were significantly less likely to experience recurrence than patients with positive margins after RT (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.47). A negative margin significantly reduced the risk of IBTR when compared with a close (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83) or unknown margin (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.87). When specific margin thresholds were examined, a 2-mm margin was superior to a margin less than 2 mm (OR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.96); however, we saw no significant difference in the rate of IBTR with margins between 2 mm and more than 5 mm (OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 0.51 to 5.0; P > .05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Surgical margins negative for DCIS should be obtained after BCS for DCIS. A margin threshold of 2 mm seems to be as good as a larger margin when BCS for DCIS is combined with RT.",

        "Background/Purpose": "There is controversy and confusion regarding therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. The Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) was developed to aid in the complex treatment selection process.",
        "Methods": "The VNPI combines three significant predictors of local recurrence: tumor size, margin width, and pathologic classification. Scores of 1 (best) to 3 (worst) were assigned for each of the 3 predictors and then totaled to give an overall VNPI score ranging from 3 to 9. Three hundred thirty-three patients with pure DCIS treated with breast preservation (195 by excision only and 138 by excision plus radiation therapy) were studied with detection of local recurrence as the end point.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no statistical difference in the 8 year local recurrence free survival in patients with VNPI scores of 3 or 4, regardless of whether or not radiation therapy was used (100% vs. 97%; P = not significant). Patients with VNPI scores of 5, 6, or 7 received a statistically significant 17% local recurrence free survival benefit when treated with radiation therapy (85% vs. 68%; P = 0.017). Patients with scores of 8 or 9, although showing the greatest relative benefit from radiation therapy, experienced local recurrence rates in excess of 60% at 8 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "DCIS patients with VNPI scores of 3 or 4 can be considered for treatment with excision only. Patients with intermediate scores (5, 6, or 7) show a 17% decrease in local recurrence rates with radiation therapy. Patients with VNPI scores of 8 or 9 exhibit extremely high local recurrence rates, regardless of irradiation, and should be considered for mastectomy.",

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of the novel antineoplastic, the epothilone B analog ixabepilone, in patients with MBC previously treated with an adjuvant anthracycline.",
        "Methods": "Patients were age >or= 18 years and had received a prior anthracycline-based regimen as adjuvant treatment. Ixabepilone as first-line metastatic chemotherapy was administered as a 40 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion during 3 hours every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary efficacy end points included duration of response, time to response, time to progression, and survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "All 65 patients were assessable for response. Their median age was 52 years (range, 33 to 80 years). ORR was 41.5% (95% CI, 29.4% to 54.4%), median duration of response was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 10.2 months), and median time to response was 6 weeks (range, 5 to 17 weeks). Median survival was 22.0 months (95% CI, 15.6 to 27.0 months). Treatment-related adverse events were manageable and mostly grades 1/2: the most common of these (other than alopecia) was mild to moderate neuropathy, which was primarily sensory and mostly reversible in nature.",

Here, we formally compare the efficacy of these regimens in a phase III trial.",
        "Methods": "Patients with stage IV/locally recurrent TNBC who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for mTNBC were randomly allocated to gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) and carboplatin area under the curve 2 (days 1 and 8) alone or GC plus iniparib 5.6 mg/kg (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) every 3 weeks.

        "Results/Findings": "Five hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned (261 GCI; 258 GC). In the primary analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.12; P = .28) nor PFS (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; P = .027).

        "Background/Purpose": "There have been many randomised trials of adjuvant tamoxifen among women with early breast cancer, and an updated overview of their results is presented.",
        "Methods": "In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen before recurrence. Information was obtained and analysed centrally on each of 37000 women in 55 such trials, comprising about 87% of the worldwide evidence. Compared with the previous such overview, this approximately doubles the amount of evidence from trials of about 5 years of tamoxifen and, taking all trials together, on events occurring more than 5 years after randomisation.",
        "Results/Findings": "Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (SD 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (chi2(1)=52.0, 2p<0.00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (chi2(1) = 8.8, 2p=0.003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10.9% (SD 2.5) for node-positive (61.4% vs 50.5% survival, 2p<0.00001) and 5.6% (SD 1.3) for node-negative (78.9% vs 73.3% survival, 2p<0.00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied (ie, including those with \"ER-poor\" tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13% (SD 13), 26% (SD 9), and 47% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0.99 [SD 0.05]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments.",

        "Background/Purpose": "There have been many randomised trials of adjuvant prolonged polychemotherapy among women with early breast cancer, and an updated overview of their results is presented.",
        "Methods": "In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 and involved treatment groups that differed only with respect to the chemotherapy regimens that were being compared. Analyses involved about 18,000 women in 47 trials of prolonged polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy, about 6000 in 11 trials of longer versus shorter polychemotherapy, and about 6000 in 11 trials of anthracycline-containing regimens versus CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil).",
        "Results/Findings": "For recurrence, polychemotherapy produced substantial and highly significant proportional reductions both among women aged under 50 at randomisation (35% [SD 4] reduction; 2p<0.00001) and among those aged 50-69 (20% [SD 3] reduction; 2p<0.00001); few women aged 70 or over had been studied. For mortality, the reductions were also significant both among women aged under 50 (27% [SD 5] reduction; 2p<0.00001) and among those aged 50-69 (11% [SD 3] reduction; 2p=0.0001). The recurrence reductions emerged chiefly during the first 5 years of follow-up, whereas the difference in survival grew throughout the first 10 years. After standardisation for age and time since randomisation, the proportional reductions in risk were similar for women with node-negative and node-positive disease. Applying the proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged under 50 at randomisation would typically change a 10-year survival of 71% for those with node-negative disease to 78% (an absolute benefit of 7%), and of 42% for those with node-positive disease to 53% (an absolute benefit of 11%). The smaller proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged 50-69 at randomisation would translate into smaller absolute benefits, changing a 10-year survival of 67% for those with node-negative disease to 69% (an absolute gain of 2%) and of 46% for those with node-positive disease to 49% (an absolute gain of 3%). The age-specific benefits of polychemotherapy appeared to be largely irrespective of menopausal status at presentation, oestrogen receptor status of the primary tumour, and of whether adjuvant tamoxifen had been given. In terms of other outcomes, there was a reduction of about one-fifth (2p=0.05) in contralateral breast cancer, which has already been included in the analyses of recurrence, and no apparent adverse effect on deaths from causes other than breast cancer (death rate ratio 0.89 [SD 0.09]). The directly randomised comparisons of longer versus shorter durations of polychemotherapy did not indicate any survival advantage with the use of more than about 3-6 months of polychemotherapy. By contrast, directly randomised comparisons did suggest that, compared with CMF alone, the anthracycline-containing regimens studied produced somewhat greater effects on recurrence (2p=0.006) and mortality (69% vs 72% 5-year survival; log-rank 2p=0.02). But this comparison is one of many that could have been selected for emphasis, the 99% CI reaches zero, and the results of several of the relevant trials are not yet available.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Some months of adjuvant polychemotherapy (eg, with CMF or an anthracycline-containing regimen) typically produces an absolute improvement of about 7-11% in 10-year survival for women aged under 50 at presentation with early breast cancer, and of about 2-3% for those aged 50-69 (unless their prognosis is likely to be extremely good even without such treatment). Treatment decisions involve consideration not only of improvements in cancer recurrence and survival but also of adverse side-effects of treatment, and this report makes no recommendations as to who should or should not be treated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "There are few randomized controlled trial data to confirm that improved homogeneity with simple intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) decreases late breast tissue toxicity. The Cambridge Breast IMRT trial investigated this hypothesis, and the 5-year results are reported.",
        "Methods": "Standard tangential plans of 1,145 trial patients were analyzed; 815 patients had inhomogeneous plans (≥ 2 cm(3) receiving 107% of prescribed dose: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) and were randomly assigned to standard radiotherapy (RT) or replanned with simple IMRT; 330 patients with satisfactory dose homogeneity were treated with standard RT and underwent the same follow-up as the randomly assigned patients. Breast tissue toxicities were assessed at 5 years using validated methods: photographic assessment (overall cosmesis and breast shrinkage compared with baseline pre-RT photographs) and clinical assessment (telangiectasia, induration, edema, and pigmentation). Comparisons between different groups were analyzed using polychotomous logistic regression.",
        "Results/Findings": "On univariate analysis, compared with standard RT, fewer patients in the simple IMRT group developed suboptimal overall cosmesis (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.96; P = .027) and skin telangiectasia (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.92; P = .021). No evidence of difference was seen for breast shrinkage, breast edema, tumor bed induration, or pigmentation. The benefit of IMRT was maintained on multivariate analysis for both overall cosmesis (P = .038) and skin telangiectasia (P = .031).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Improved dose homogeneity with simple IMRT translates into superior overall cosmesis and reduces the risk of skin telangiectasia. These results are practice changing and should encourage centers still using two-dimensional RT to implement simple breast IMRT.",

Additional analyses of the hot flash score over the full 12 weeks of treatment were performed.",
        "Methods": "In all, 102 patients with a history of breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to venlafaxine 75 mg, clonidine 0.1 mg, or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Questionnaires at baseline and during treatment assessed daily hot flash scores, sexual function, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression.",
        "Results/Findings": "After 12 weeks, a total of 80 patients were evaluable for the primary end point. During week 12, hot flash scores were significantly lower in the clonidine group versus placebo (P = .03); for venlafaxine versus placebo, the difference was borderline not significant (P = .07). However, hot flash scores were equal in the clonidine and venlafaxine groups. Over the course of 12 weeks, the differences between both treatments and placebo were significant (P <.001 for venlafaxine v placebo; P = .045 for clonidine v placebo). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse effects of nausea (P = .02), constipation (P = .04), and severe appetite loss were higher in the venlafaxine group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Venlafaxine and clonidine are effective treatments in the management of hot flashes in patients with breast cancer.

        "Background/Purpose": "The Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) is a simple score for predicting the risk of local recurrence (LR) in patients with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) conservatively treated. This score combines three independent predictors of Local Recurrence. The VNPI has recently been updated with the addition of age as a fourth parameter into the scoring system (University of Southern California/ VNPI).",
        "Methods": "Our database consisted of 408 women with DCIS. Applying the USC/VNPI we reviewed retrospectively 259 patients who were treated with breast conserving surgery with or without radiotherapy (RT). Of these patients 63.5% had a low VNPI score, 32% intermediate and 4.5% a high score. In the low score group, the majority of the patients underwent Conservative Surgery (CS) without RT while in the intermediate group, almost half of the patients received RT. Eighty-three percent (83%) of the patients with high VNPI were treated with Conservative Surgery plus RT. Nodal assessment by Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy was obtained in 32 patients since 2002.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-one Local Recurrences were observed (8%) with a mean follow up of 130 months: sixteen were invasive. No statistically significant differences in Disease Free Survival were reached in all groups of VNPI score between patients treated with Conservative Surgery or Conservative Surgery plus RT. However it was noted that the higher the VNPI score, the lower was the risk of local recurrence in the group treated additionally with RT, even though it was not statistically significant. Further analysis included those patients treated with Conservative Surgery alone and followed up. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years was 94% with low VNPI and 83% in both intermediate and high score (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the subgroups of VNPI. The Local Relapse rate after Conservative Surgery alone, increased with tumor size, margin width, and pathology classification (P < 0,05), while age was not found to be a significant factor. Lesions with only mammographic appearances are associated with lower DFS but it did not reach significance (P = ns), while assumption of estrogenic hormones and familial history of breast cancer are significant factors associated with a higher risk of local recurrence. After multivariate analysis including seven clinical and pathological factors, the only significant predictors of local recurrence remained margin width of surgical excision, previous therapy with estrogens (contraceptives or Hormone Replacement Therapy) and the Van Nuys pathologic classification. The overall survival breast cancer specific was 99% and no differences were observed between groups (P = ns). The comparison of patients treated with a total mastectomy and those conservatively treated showed a significantly better local relapse free survival rate obtained with mastectomy (98.2% vs. 89.7% at 10 years P = 0.02). However, the overall cause-specific survival did not prove any better outcome (98.7% in both groups). Of the 32 patients who underwent a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy, four were found to have micrometastases and all of them had a previous Directional Vacuum Assisted Biopsy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although in our series there is not a significant difference in LR rates by the parameter of age, the new USC/VNPI is still a simple and reliable scoring system for therapeutic management of DCIS. We did not find any statistically significant advantage in groups treated with the addition of RT. Obtaining wide surgical margins appears to be the strongest prognostic factor for local recurrence, regardless of other pathological factors or the addition of adjuvant radiation therapy. However, only prospective randomized studies can precisely predict the risk of LR of conservatively treated DCIS. The clinical significance of Sentinel Lymph Nodes micrometastases Immuno-Histo-Chemistry-detected found in DCIS patients remains uncertain. However, we hypothesize that the anatomical disruption after preoperative biopsy procedures increases the likelihood of epithelial cell displacement and the frequency of IHC-positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes, both of which are directly proportional to the degree of manipulation.",

Given the limited events after WBRT, an a priori power analysis was conducted to estimate the DCIS sample size needed to detect the anticipated benefit of the boost. Data were uniformly recoded at the host institution and underwent primary and secondary reviews before analysis. Sample size calculations (ratio of patients who received the boost dose to those who did not, 2:1; α = .05; power = 80%) estimated that 2982 cases were needed to detect a difference of at least 3%.

        "Background/Purpose": "The treatment of inflammatory breast cancer includes preoperative anthracycline-based chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. In the past few years, taxanes, mainly paclitaxel, have been frequently used for preoperative chemotherapy, usually in sequence with anthracyclines. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to determine how adding paclitaxel to anthracycline-based regimens affects prognosis. A total of 240 patients treated in 6 consecutive trials between 1973 and 2000 were included in the analysis. Group 1 (N = 178) consisted of patients treated in the first 4 trials (1973-1993) with FAC (5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) based regimens. Group 2 (N = 62) consisted of patients treated in the last 2 trials (1994-2000) with FAC followed by paclitaxel given every 3 weeks or given in a high-dose weekly schedule. The 2 groups differed with respect to median follow-up durations, which were 148 months (range, 85-283 months) in group 1 and 45 months (range, 21-99 months) in group 2. Estrogen receptor (ER) status was negative in 58 cases (33%) in group 1 and 40 cases (65%) in group 2. There was no difference in median age between the groups. The objective response rates (complete and partial) were similar (group 1, 74%; group 2, 82%). The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were better in the patients treated with paclitaxel, and these differences reached statistical significance in the patients with ER-negative disease (median OS: group 1, 32 months; group 2, 54 months; P = 0.03; median PFS: group 1, 18 months; group 2, 27 months; P = 0.04). It may be concluded that the addition of paclitaxel to anthracycline-based therapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in outcome in patients with ER-negative inflammatory breast cancer.",

The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). A fulvestrant loading-dose (LD) regimen was used: 500 mg intramuscularly on day 0, 250 mg on days 14, 28, and 250 mg every 28 days thereafter. Exemestane 25 mg orally was administered once daily.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 693 women were randomly assigned to fulvestrant (n = 351) or exemestane (n = 342). Approximately 60% of patients had received at least two prior endocrine therapies. Median TTP was 3.7 months in both groups (hazard ratio = 0.963; 95% CI, 0.819 to 1.133; P = .6531). The overall response rate (7.4% v 6.7%; P = .736) and clinical benefit rate (32.2% v 31.5%; P = .853) were similar between fulvestrant and exemestane respectively. Median duration of clinical benefit was 9.3 and 8.3 months, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events or quality of life. Pharmacokinetic data confirm that steady-state was reached within 1 month with the LD schedule of fulvestrant.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The study aims to evaluate the survival and prognosis of patients with malignant phyllodes tumor. Between 1982 and 1998, 37 women with malignant phyllodes tumor were treated at the Regional Cancer Center, Trivandrum. Twelve patients were recurrent. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patient, disease, and treatment factors were compared using log-rank test. The Cox-proportional hazard model was employed to identify the prognostic factors. Thirty-six patients had surgery. Twenty-five patients received postoperative radiotherapy, and 2 received chemotherapy in addition. The median follow-up was 43 months (range 1-170 months). Eight patients failed locally, and 7 of these were successfully salvaged by surgery. The 5-year overall survival was 74.2% (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.89), whereas 5-year disease-free survival was 59.6% (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.7). The margin of surgical excision was found to be the only independent prognostic factor (p=0.003). However, patients with tumor size more than 5 cm (hazard ratio 2.9) were found to have increased hazard, whereas those receiving adjuvant radiotherapy (hazard ratio 0.6), married women (hazard ratio 0.4), and those women over the age of 35 years (hazard ratio 0.7) showed a decreased hazards. Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a rare malignancy of the female breast. Surgery with adequate margins is the primary treatment. Adjuvant radiotherapy appears to improve the disease-free survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The status of the gene encoding human EGF-like receptor 2 (HER2) is an important prognostic and predictive marker in breast cancer. Only breast cancers with HER2 amplification respond to the targeted therapy with trastuzumab. It is controversial to what degree the primary tumour is representative of distant metastases in terms of HER2 status. Discrepancies in HER2 status between primary tumours and distant metastases have been described, but their reasons remain unclear. Here, we compared HER2 status on cytological specimens of distant metastases with the result from the primary carcinomas, and explored the prevalence of and the reasons for discrepant results.",
        "Methods": "HER2 status was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. HER2 gene amplification was defined as a HER2/chromosome 17 signal ratio of 2 or more. HER2 results from cytological specimens of matched distant metastases were compared with the results from the corresponding primary tumours (n = 105 patients). In addition, lymph node metastases were analysed in 31 of these patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER2 amplification was found in 20% of distant metastases. HER2 status was discordant between the primary tumour and distant metastasis in 7.6% of the 105 patients. Re-evaluation revealed that in five patients (4.7%), discrepancies were due to interpretational difficulties. In two of these patients, focal amplification had initially been overlooked as a result of heterogeneity in the primary tumours or in the metastases, respectively. A further three patients had borderline amplification with a ratio close to 2. Discrepancy remained unexplained in three patients (2.9%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "HER2 gene status remains highly conserved as breast cancers metastasise. However, discrepant results do occur because of interpretational difficulties and heterogeneity of HER2 amplification. Cytological specimens from distant metastases are well suited for HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The standard local management for Paget's disease of the nipple is currently mastectomy although this may well represent overtreatment. The place of breast conserving surgery is somewhat uncertain. We have reviewed the casenotes of 146 patients with Paget's disease of the nipple, and compared the mortality and recurrence rates between 74 women who had undergone mastectomy and 31 women who had breast conserving surgery. There was no significant difference in either local or overall treatment failure rates between these two treatment groups. We conclude that breast conserving treatment maybe an appropriate alternative to mastectomy for the management of Paget's disease, where clear margins of excision can be achieved.

        "Background/Purpose": "The standard adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive localised breast cancer is 5 years of tamoxifen, but recurrences and side-effects restrict its usefulness. The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was compared with tamoxifen for 5 years in 9366 postmenopausal women with localised breast cancer. After a median follow-up of 68 months, anastrozole significantly prolonged disease-free survival (575 events with anastrozole vs 651 with tamoxifen, hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97, p=0.01) and time-to-recurrence (402 vs 498, 0.79, 0.70-0.90, p=0.0005), and significantly reduced distant metastases (324 vs 375, 0.86, 0.74-0.99, p=0.04) and contralateral breast cancers (35 vs 59, 42% reduction, 12-62, p=0.01). Almost all patients have completed their scheduled treatment, and fewer withdrawals occurred with anastrozole than with tamoxifen. Anastrozole was also associated with fewer side-effects than tamoxifen, especially gynaecological problems and vascular events, but arthralgia and fractures were increased. Anastrozole should be the preferred initial treatment for postmenopausal women with localised hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The spectrum and frequency of cancers associated with germline TP53 mutations are uncertain. To address this issue a cohort of individuals from 28 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, segregating germline TP53 mutations was established. Predicted cancers were estimated by applying age, morphology, site and sex-specific UK cancer statistics to person-years at risk. Observed and predicted cancers were compared and two-sided P-values calculated. Cancer types occurring to excess and showing P-values <0.02, were designated strongly associated with germline TP53 mutations. These were removed from the data and a second round of analyses performed. Cancer types with P-values <0.02 and 0.02-0.05 in the second round analyses were considered moderately and weakly associated respectively. Strongly associated cancers were: breast carcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcoma, brain tumours, adrenocortical carcinoma, Wilms' tumour and phyllodes tumour. Carcinoma of pancreas was moderately associated. Leukaemia and neuroblastoma were weakly associated. Other common carcinomas including lung, colon, bladder, prostate, cervix and ovary did not occur to excess. Although breast carcinoma and sarcomas were numerically most frequent, the greatest increases relative to general population rates were in adrenocortical carcinoma and phyllodes tumour. We conclude that germline TP53 mutations do not simply increase general cancer risk. There are tissue-specific effects.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen has been used for more than three decades for the treatment, and more recently prevention, of breast cancer in women of all ages. The conversion of tamoxifen to active metabolites involves several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. CYP2D6 is the key enzyme responsible for the conversion of N-desmethyl tamoxifen to endoxifen. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene are not uncommon, and some alleles code for enzymes with reduced, null, or increased activity. Multiple studies suggest that women who carry one or two variant CYP2D6 alleles that encode enzymes with null or reduced activity may have an inferior breast cancer outcome when treated with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting compared to women carrying two alleles encoding an enzyme with normal activity. Unfortunately, the data are not uniformly concordant, and definitive evidence that would change routine clinical practice is not yet available. CYP2D6 activity can also be reduced by concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the enzyme, including antidepressants used for psychiatric conditions or to relieve hot flashes, and these should be avoided in tamoxifen users whenever possible. Emerging data suggest that host factors may also predict interpatient variability in response to aromatase inhibitors.",

Primary tumor characteristics influencing occult nipple malignancy were tumor-nipple distance less than 2 cm, grade, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-negative, tumor size greater than 5 cm, retroareolar/central location, and multicentric tumors. The overall nipple recurrence rate considered significant was 0.9 percent, and the skin flap recurrence rate was 4.2 percent. Full- and partial-thickness nipple necrosis rates were 2.9 and 6.3 percent, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Nipple-sparing mastectomy for primary breast cancer is appropriate in carefully selected patients. All patients should have retroareolar sampling. There is strong evidence to suggest that suitable cases are well circumscribed single or multifocal lesions that have a tumor-to-nipple distance greater than 2 cm. Tumors should be grade 1 to 2 and not have lymphovascular invasion, axillary node metastasis, or human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positivity.",

        "Methods": "Retrospective chart review comparing women treated for DCIS who did and did not undergo MRI for preoperative planning. End points included number of additional biopsies prompted by MRI, surgical reexcision rates, weight of excisions, mastectomy rates, and conversion to mastectomy after attempted breast conservation.",
        "Results/Findings": "218 patients met study criteria. Sixty-four patients did not undergo preoperative MRI, and 154 patients did. There was no statistically significant difference (P = not significant, NS) in reexcision rates between the 34.1 % (42/123) of women who did and 20/51 (39.2 %) women who did not undergo MRI. Despite use of preoperative MRI, 11/123 women (8.9 %) were converted to mastectomy due to positive margins compared with 4/51 (7.8 %) in the women who did not undergo MRI (P = NS). In women undergoing MRI, average weight of excision at definitive surgery was 49.5 g, while in women who did not undergo MRI, average weight of excision at definitive surgery was 48.7 g.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our data show that MRI does not significantly decrease reexcision rates or conversion to mastectomy after attempted breast-conservation surgery. Based on our findings, we do not believe preoperative MRI adds benefit to the care of this patient population.

        "Background/Purpose": "The role of locoregional treatment in women with metastatic breast cancer at first presentation is unclear. Preclinical evidence suggests that such treatment might help the growth of metastatic disease, whereas many retrospective analyses in clinical cohorts have suggested a favourable effect of locoregional treatment in these patients. We aimed to compare the effect of locoregional treatment with no treatment on outcome in women with metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation.",
        "Methods": "In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited previously untreated patients (≤65 years of age with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at least 1 year) presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast tumour and axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, by a computer-generated block randomisation sequence (block size of four). Randomisation was stratified by site of distant metastases, number of metastatic lesions, and hormone receptor status. Patients with resectable primary tumour in the breast that could be treated with endocrine therapy were randomly assigned upfront, whereas those with an unresectable primary tumour were planned for chemotherapy before randomisation. Of the patients who had chemotherapy before randomisation, we randomly assigned patients who had an objective tumour response after six to eight cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 7, 2005, and Jan 18, 2013, of the 716 women presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, we randomly assigned 350 patients: 173 to locoregional treatment and 177 to no locoregional treatment. At data cut-off of Nov 1, 2013, median follow-up was 23 months (IQR 12·2-38·7) with 235 deaths (locoregional treatment n=118, no locoregional treatment n=117). Median overall survival was 19·2 months (95% CI 15·98-22·46) in the locoregional treatment group and 20·5 months (16·96-23·98) in the no-locoregional treatment group (HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·81-1·34; p=0·79), and the corresponding 2-year overall survival was 41·9% (95% CI 33·9-49·7) in the locoregional treatment group and 43·0% (35·2-50·8) in the no locoregional treatment group. The only adverse event noted was wound infection related to surgery in one patient in the locoregional treatment group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "There is no evidence to suggest that locoregional treatment of the primary tumour affects overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation who have responded to front-line chemotherapy, and this procedure should not be part of routine practice.",

This retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed registry evaluated treatments/outcomes in node-positive breast cancer patients who were Recurrence Score-tested through Clalit Health Services from 1/2006 through 12/2011 (  = 709). Medical records were reviewed to verify treatments/recurrences/survival. Median follow-up, 5.9 years; median age, 62 years; 53.9% grade 2; 69.8% tumors ≤ 2 cm; 84.5% invasive ductal carcinoma; 42.0% N1mi, and 37.2%/15.5%/5.2% with 1/2/3 positive nodes; 53.4% Recurrence Score < 18, 36.4% Recurrence Score 18-30, and 10.2% Recurrence Score ≥ 31. Overall, 26.9% received adjuvant chemotherapy: 7.1%, 39.5%, and 86.1% in the Recurrence Score < 18, 18-30, and ≥ 31 group, respectively. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for distant recurrence were 3.2%, 6.3%, and 16.9% for these respective groups and the corresponding 5-year breast cancer death estimates were 0.5%, 3.4%, and 5.7%. In Recurrence Score < 18 patients, 5-year distant-recurrence rates for N1mi/1 positive node/2-3 positive nodes were 1.2%/4.4%/5.4%. As patients were not randomized to treatment and treatment decision is heavily influenced by Recurrence Score, analysis of 5-year distant recurrence by chemotherapy use was exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously: In Recurrence Score < 18, recurrence rate was 7.7% in chemotherapy-treated (  = 27) and 2.9% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (  = 352);   = 0.245. In Recurrence Score 18-30, recurrence rate in chemotherapy-treated patients (  = 102) was significantly lower than in untreated patients (  = 156) (1.0% vs. 9.7%   = 0.019); in Recurrence Score ≤ 25 (the RxPONDER study cutoff), recurrence rate was 2.3% in chemotherapy-treated (  = 89) and 4.4% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (  = 488);   = 0.521. In conclusion, our findings support using endocrine therapy alone in ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer patients with micrometastases/1-3 positive nodes and Recurrence Score < 18.",

The primary objective was to determine the effect of chemotherapy on invasive disease-free survival and whether the effect was influenced by the recurrence score. Secondary end points included distant relapse-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 5083 women (33.2% premenopausal and 66.8% postmenopausal) underwent randomization, and 5018 participated in the trial. At the prespecified third interim analysis, the chemotherapy benefit with respect to increasing invasive disease-free survival differed according to menopausal status (P = 0.008 for the comparison of chemotherapy benefit in premenopausal and postmenopausal participants), and separate prespecified analyses were conducted. Among postmenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.9% in the endocrine-only group and 91.3% in the chemoendocrine group, with no chemotherapy benefit (hazard ratio for invasive disease recurrence, new primary cancer [breast cancer or another type], or death, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.26; P = 0.89). Among premenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 89.0% with endocrine-only therapy and 93.9% with chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.83; P = 0.002), with a similar increase in distant relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87; P = 0.009).

The first pre-specified interim analysis (IA) previously demonstrated statistically significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS). The olaparib group had fewer deaths than the placebo group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance for overall survival (OS). We now report the pre-specified second IA of OS with updates of IDFS, DDFS, and safety.",
        "Methods": "One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to olaparib or placebo following (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy if indicated.

Four-year OS was 89.8% in the olaparib group and 86.4% in the placebo group (Δ 3.4%, 95% CI -0.1% to 6.8%). Four-year IDFS for the olaparib group versus placebo group was 82.7% versus 75.4% (Δ 7.3%, 95% CI 3.0% to 11.5%) and 4-year DDFS was 86.5% versus 79.1% (Δ 7.4%, 95% CI 3.6% to 11.3%), respectively.

At 7 years, the LF rate was 0.9% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.2%) in the RT arm versus 6.7% (95% CI, 3.2% to 9.6%) in the observation arm (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.47; P < .001). Grade 1 to 2 acute toxicities occurred in 30% and 76% of patients in the observation and RT arms, respectively; grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in 4.0% and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Late RT toxicity was grade 1 in 30%, grade 2 in 4.6%, and grade 3 in 0.7% of patients.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this good-risk subset of patients with DCIS, with a median follow-up of 7 years, the LF rate was low with observation but was decreased significantly with the addition of RT. Longer follow-up is planned because the timeline for LF in this setting seems protracted.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of this study was to identify the axillary lymph nodes on pretreatment diagnostic computed tomography (CT) of the chest to determine their position relative to the anatomic axillary borders as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) breast cancer atlas for radiation therapy planning.",
        "Methods": "Pretreatment diagnostic CT chest scans available for 30 breast cancer patients with clinically involved lymph nodes were fused with simulation CT. Contouring of axillary levels I, II, and III according to the RTOG guidelines was performed. Measurements were made from the area of distal tumor to the anatomic borders in 6 dimensions for each level.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 30 patients, 100%, 93%, and 37% had clinical involvement of levels I, II, and III, respectively. The mean number of lymph nodes dissected was 13.6. The mean size of the largest lymph node was 2.4 cm. Extracapsular extension was seen in 23% of patients. In 97% of patients, an aspect of the involved lymph node lay outside of the anatomic border of a level. In 80% and 83% of patients, tumor extension was seen outside the cranial (1.78 ± 1.0 cm; range, 0.28-3.58 cm) and anterior (1.27 ± 0.92 cm; range, 0.24-3.58 cm) borders of level I, respectively. In 80% of patients, tumor extension was seen outside the caudal border of level II (1.36 ± 1.0 cm, range, 0.27-3.86 cm), and 0% to 33% of patients had tumor extension outside the remaining borders of all levels.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "To cover 95% of lymph nodes at the cranial and anterior borders of level I, an additional clinical target volume margin of 3.78 cm and 3.11 cm, respectively, is necessary. The RTOG guidelines may be insufficient for coverage of axillary disease in patients with clinical nodal involvement who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, incomplete axillary dissection, or treatment with intensity modulated radiation therapy. In patients with pretreatment diagnostic CT chest scans, fusion with simulation CT should be considered for tumor delineation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of breast-conserving therapy involving limited surgery and definitive radiotherapy as a treatment for Paget's disease, and to determine the disease free and overall survival associated with this approach.",
        "Methods": "The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients treated during the period 1980-1994 for Paget's disease of the breast who did not present with a palpable mass or mammographic density. Through a collaborative review, 30 cases were identified. A biopsy confirming the presence of typical Paget's cells was performed on all patients. All patients received external beam radiotherapy to the breast, with a median dose of 50 gray (Gy). Ninety-seven percent received a boost to the remaining nipple or tumor bed, with a median dose to the tumor bed of 61.5 Gy.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up for surviving patients was 62 months. Three patients (10%) developed a recurrence in the breast as the only site of first failure, and 2 additional patients (7%) experienced failure in the breast as a component of first failure. The median time to local failure was 69 months. The 5- and 8-year actuarial estimates of local failure as the only site of first failure were 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-20%) and 16% (95% CI, 0-31%), respectively. Of the 5 patients with local failures, 3 were among 22 patients (14%) who underwent complete resection of the nipple or nipple-areola complex, compared with 2 failures among 6 patients (33%) after partial resection (P = 0.29). There were no failures among 2 patients who had a biopsy only. Four of 5 local failures were salvaged by mastectomy, and 3 of these patients were free of disease after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5- and 8-year estimates of disease free survival for the overall series were both 95% (95% CI, 87-100%); cause specific overall survival was 100% at 8 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast-conserving therapy involving complete resection of the nipple-areola complex followed by definitive radiotherapy is a viable alternative to mastectomy in the treatment of Paget's disease. High rates of disease free and cause specific survival, in addition to adequate local control, justify consideration of a conservative approach.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) for sentinel lymph node (SNL) mapping in a woman with a breast mass presents an unacceptable risk to her fetus. We assessed radiation-absorbed dose to various organs from 99mTc-sulfur colloid (TSC) LSG using standard internal absorbed dose assessment methodologies for both reference phantoms as well as for phantom models using the specific patient population characteristics such as total body and injected organ mass. The study also projected the radiation-absorbed dose to the fetus from LSG for SLN mapping.",
        "Methods": "Data from 1,021 nonpregnant women with early-stage breast cancer who underwent SLN mapping and biopsy procedures were analyzed. Patients had a single-site intradermal injection of unfiltered TSC in 0.05 mL normal saline: 3.7 MBq (0.1 mCi) on the morning of surgery (1-d protocol) or 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) on the afternoon before surgery (2-d protocol). A standard internal dose calculation methodology was used to calculate absorbed doses to various organs and to a modeled fetus at 3-, 6-, and 9-mo gestation from the injection site as well as from systemic activity.",
        "Results/Findings": "The highest estimated absorbed doses were observed for the reference 9-mo-pregnant model under the 2-d protocol. Absorbed doses of 14.9, 0.214, 0.062, 0.151, 0.004, 0.163, 0.075, and 0.014 mGy were received by the injected breast, heart, liver, lung, ovaries, thymus, total body, and fetus, respectively. Effective doses from the 2-d protocol were estimated to be 0.460, 0.186, and 0.245 mSv for the reference population, the total Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) study patient population, and childbearing-age MSKCC patient population (i.e., <45 y old), respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SLN procedures lead to a negligible dose to the fetus of 0.014 mGy or less. This is much less than the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements limit to a pregnant woman.

The majority of patients (97%) presented without an associated palpable mass. At histologic examination, the majority (93%%) of patients had an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); in the remaining 7%, only Paget disease was found. Treatment was comprised of a complete excision of the nipple-areolar complex including the underlying breast tissue with tumor free margins, followed by external irradiation to the whole breast (50 gray in 25 fractions). The primary endpoint was local recurrence.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 4 of the 61 patients developed a recurrence in the treated breast (1 patient with DCIS and 3 patients with invasive disease). One patient with an invasive local recurrence died of disseminated breast carcinoma. The 5-year local recurrence rate was 5.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.8-14.1%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast-conserving therapy is a feasible alternative for patients with Paget disease and a limited extent of underlying DCIS.

        "Background/Purpose": "The purpose of axillary surgery in breast cancer is to provide prognostic information to guide the choice of adjuvant systemic therapy. Axillary surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was abandoned in the 1980s because of the extremely low risk of lymph node metastases and high survival rates. Most women with metastases probably harbored an unrecognized focus of invasion or had metastases subsequent to an invasive local recurrence. Increased use of the less morbid sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for axillary staging of invasive cancer and the recognition that many patients will harbor micrometastases in nodes only recognized by cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC) led two groups to perform SNB with IHC in women with DCIS. One group included all subtypes of DCIS and found metastases in 13% (half of which were detected only on IHC). The other group studied only patients with \"high-risk\" DCIS. They found metastases in 12% (7 of 9 by IHC only). These groups recommend SNB for women with DCIS. However, the use of SNB in DCIS should be tempered by the uncertainty of the prognostic significance of IHC-detected metastases, the conflicting results of these 2 studies, and the real potential to cause more harm than good from the morbidity of the procedure, the application of unnecessary axillary dissection, and the use of unwarranted adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. These results should be used to generate hypotheses for clinical trials addressing these problems. However, SNB for DCIS remains investigational and should not be generally applied.",

Patients with RS ≥ 12, pN2-3, or HR-negative/HER2-negative disease were randomised to anthracycline-containing or anthracycline-free chemotherapy. Primary endpoint: disease-free survival (DFS). PlanB Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:  .",
        "Results/Findings": "From 2009 to 2011, PlanB enrolled 3198 patients (central tumour bank, n = 3073) with the median age of 56 years, 41.1% pN+, and 32.5% grade 3 EBC. Chemotherapy was omitted in 348/404 (86.1%) eligible RS ≤ 11 patients. After 55 months of median follow-up, five-year DFS in ET-treated RS ≤ 11 patients was 94% (in both pN0 and pN1) versus 94% (RS 12-25) and 84% (RS > 25) in chemotherapy-treated patients (p < 0.001); five-year overall survival (OS) was 99 versus 97% and 93%, respectively (p < 0.001). Nodal status, central/local grade, tumour size, continuous Ki-67, progesterone receptor (PR), IHC4, and RS were univariate prognostic factors for DFS. In a multivariate analysis including all univariate prognostic markers, only pN2-3, central and local grade 3, tumour size >2 cm, and RS, but not IHC4 or Ki-67 were independent adverse factors. If RS was excluded, IHC4 or both Ki-67 and PR entered the model. The impact of RS was particularly pronounced in patients with intermediate Ki-67 (>10%, <40%) tumours.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The excellent five-year outcomes in clinically high-risk, genomically low-risk (RS ≤ 11) pN0-1 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy support using RS with standardised pathology for treatment decisions in HR+ HER2-negative EBC. Ki-67 has the potential to support patient selection for genomic testing.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With a median follow-up of 94.8 months, nine recurrences were reported. Neither univariate nor multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between HER-2/neu expression and disease recurrence or the time to disease recurrence. Although HER-2/neu expression demonstrated a significant association with high nuclear grade (P < 0.0001) and comedo subtype (P < 0.0001), there was no correlation between these histologic features and recurrence rate. The correlation between high nuclear grade and disease recurrence approached statistical significance (P = 0.07).",

        "Methods": "Between August 1995 and May 1998, 3,060 patients were randomly assigned (AC, 1,529; AC followed by PTX [AC --> PTX], 1,531). Patients > or = 50 years and those younger than 50 years with estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) -positive tumors also received tamoxifen for 5 years, starting with the first dose of AC. Postlumpectomy radiotherapy was mandated. Postmastectomy or regional radiotherapy was prohibited. Median follow-up is 64.6 months.",
        "Results/Findings": "The addition of PTX to AC significantly reduced the hazard for DFS event by 17% (relative risk [RR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.95; P = .006). Five-year DFS was 76% +/- 2% for patients randomly assigned to AC --> PTX compared with 72% +/- 2% for those randomly assigned to AC. Improvement in OS was small and not statistically significant (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.12; P = .46). Five-year OS was 85% +/- 2% for both groups. Subset analysis of the effect of paclitaxel according to hormone receptors or tamoxifen administration did not reveal statistically significant interaction (for DFS, P = .30 and P = .44, respectively). Toxicity with the AC --> PTX regimen was acceptable for the adjuvant setting.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of PTX to AC resulted in significant improvement in DFS but no significant improvement in OS with acceptable toxicity. No significant interaction between treatment effect and receptor status or tamoxifen administration was observed.",

The median age was 52+/-11 years (range 32-79 years). All PET studies results were correlated with follow-up surgical pathology results.

        "Results/Findings": "Of 116 breast lesions, 85 were malignant and 31 were benign on histopathology. Of the 85 malignant lesions, 41 were true positive (TP) and 44 were FN. Among the 31 benign lesions, 30 were true negative and one was false positive. There was significant difference in the tumor size (p=0.003) and tumor grade (p=0.001) in patients with TP and FN PET results. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that tumor size (< or =10 mm) and low tumor grade were independently associated with FN results. No significant relationship of FN PET results was found with age, menopausal status, tumor type, c-erbB-2, estrogen and progesterone receptors, sentinel lymph node or distant metastasis, parenchymal density and multifocality of primary breast tumor.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In present study, tumor size and tumor grade are independent factors that predict FDG-PET results. Smaller tumors (< or =10 mm) and low-grade tumors are strong predictor of FN FDG-PET results.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The preponderance of evidence states that, in adult men, estradiol (E2) inhibits LH secretion by decreasing pulse amplitude and responsiveness to GnRH consistent with a pituitary site of action. However, this conclusion is based on studies that employed pharmacologic doses of sex steroids, used nonselective aromatase inhibitors, and/or were performed in normal (NL) men, a model in which endogenous counterregulatory adaptations to physiologic perturbations confound interpretation of the results. In addition, studies in which estrogen antagonists were administered to NL men demonstrated an increase in LH pulse frequency, suggesting a potential additional hypothalamic site of E2 feedback. To reconcile these conflicting data, we used a selective aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, to examine the impact of E2 suppression on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in the male. Parallel studies of NL men and men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), whose pituitary-gonadal axis had been normalized with long-term GnRH therapy, were performed to permit precise localization of the site of E2 feedback. In this so-called tandem model, a hypothalamic site of action of sex steroids can thus be inferred whenever there is a difference in the gonadotropin responses of NL and IHH men to alterations in their sex steroid milieu. A selective GnRH antagonist was also used to provide a semiquantitative estimate of endogenous GnRH secretion before and after E2 suppression. Fourteen NL men and seven IHH men were studied. In Exp 1, nine NL and seven IHH men received anastrozole (10 mg/day po x 7 days). Blood samples were drawn daily between 0800 and 1000 h in the NL men and immediately before a GnRH bolus dose in the IHH men. In Exp 2, blood was drawn (every 10 min x 12 h) from nine NL men at baseline and on day 7 of anastrozole. In a subset of five NL men, 5 microg/kg of the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist was administered on completion of frequent blood sampling, then sampling continued every 20 min for a further 8 h. Anastrozole suppressed E2 equivalently in the NL (136 +/- 10 to 52 +/-2 pmol/L, P < 0.005) and IHH men (118 +/- 23 to 60 +/- 5 pmol/L, P < 0.005). Testosterone levels rose significantly (P < 0.005), with a mean increase of 53 +/- 6% in NL vs. 56 +/- 7% in IHH men. Despite these similar changes in sex steroids, the increase in gonadotropins was greater in NL than in IHH men (100 +/- 9 vs. 58 +/- 6% for LH, P = 0.07; and 85 +/- 6 vs. 41 +/- 4% for FSH, P < 0.002). Frequent sampling studies in the NL men demonstrated that this rise in mean LH levels, after aromatase blockade, reflected an increase in both LH pulse frequency (10.2 +/- 0.9 to 14.0 +/- 1.0 pulses/24 h, P < 0.05) and pulse amplitude (5.7 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 0.7 IU/L, P < 0.001). Percent LH inhibition after acute GnRH receptor blockade was similar at baseline and after E2 suppression (69.2 +/- 2.4 vs. 70 +/- 1.9%), suggesting that there was no change in the quantity of endogenous GnRH secreted. From these data, we conclude that in the human male, estrogen has dual sites of negative feedback, acting at the hypothalamus to decrease GnRH pulse frequency and at the pituitary to decrease responsiveness to GnRH.",

The effect of preoperative endocrine therapy in patients scheduled for mastectomy or with inoperable tumors at baseline was also investigated.",
        "Methods": "Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer received anastrozole (n = 228) or tamoxifen (n = 223) with or without chemotherapy for 12 weeks before primary surgery.",
        "Results/Findings": "Objective responses for anastrozole and tamoxifen occurred in 39.5% and 35.4% of patients, respectively (ultrasound measurements), and 50.0% and 46.2% of patients, respectively (caliper measurements). In hormonal therapy-only patients (n = 314), feasible surgery at baseline improved after 3 months in 43.0% of patients receiving anastrozole and 30.8% receiving tamoxifen (P = .04). In the intent-to-treat population, improvement in feasible surgery at baseline to actual surgery at 3 months was found to be numerically higher in the anastrozole group compared with the tamoxifen group, although this difference did not reach significance. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 20.2% and 18.1% of patients, respectively, in the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole is an effective and well-tolerated preoperative therapy, producing clinically beneficial tumor downstaging and reductions in tumor volume. These effects enable more minimal surgical interventions in patients scheduled for mastectomy, and mastectomy in patients with previously inoperable tumors.

MONARCH 1 was a phase II single-arm open-label study. Women with HR /HER2  MBC who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy and had 1 or 2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting were eligible. Abemaciclib 200 mg was administered orally on a continuous schedule every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of MONARCH 1 was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). Other endpoints included clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).  Patients (  = 132) had a median of 3 (range, 1-8) lines of prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting, 90.2% had visceral disease, and 50.8% had ≥3 metastatic sites. At the 12-month final analysis, the primary objective of confirmed objective response rate was 19.7% (95% CI, 13.3-27.5; 15% not excluded); clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD≥6 months) was 42.4%, median progression-free survival was 6.0 months, and median overall survival was 17.7 months. The most common treatment-emergent AEs of any grade were diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea; discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent (7.6%).

        "Background/Purpose": "The past few years have witnessed an exponential increase in studies trying to identify molecular markers in patients with breast tumours that might predict for the success or failure of hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. HER2, a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, has been the most widely studied marker in this respect. This paper attempts to critically review to what extent HER2 may improve 'treatment individualisation' for the breast cancer patient.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The optimum timing of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain. The SENTINA (SENTinel NeoAdjuvant) study was designed to evaluate a specific algorithm for timing of a standardised sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure in patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "SENTINA is a four-arm, prospective, multicentre cohort study undertaken at 103 institutions in Germany and Austria. Women with breast cancer who were scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled into the study. Patients with clinically node-negative disease (cN0) underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm A). If the sentinel node was positive (pN1), a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure was done after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B). Women with clinically node-positive disease (cN+) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those who converted to clinically node-negative disease after chemotherapy (ycN0; arm C) were treated with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and axillary dissection. Only patients whose clinical nodal status remained positive (ycN1) underwent axillary dissection without sentinel-lymph-node biopsy (arm D). The primary endpoint was accuracy (false-negative rate) of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients who converted from cN1 to ycN0 disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm C). Secondary endpoints included comparison of the detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and also the false-negative rate and detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after removal of the sentinel lymph node. Analyses were done according to treatment received (per protocol).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1737 patients who received treatment, 1022 women underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arms A and B), with a detection rate of 99.1% (95% CI 98.3-99.6; 1013 of 1022). In patients who converted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from cN+ to ycN0 (arm C), the detection rate was 80.1% (95% CI 76.6-83.2; 474 of 592) and false-negative rate was 14.2% (95% CI 9.9-19.4; 32 of 226). The false-negative rate was 24.3% (17 of 70) for women who had one node removed and 18.5% (10 of 54) for those who had two sentinel nodes removed (arm C). In patients who had a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B), the detection rate was 60.8% (95% CI 55.6-65.9; 219 of 360) and the false-negative rate was 51.6% (95% CI 38.7-64.2; 33 of 64).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is a reliable diagnostic method before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After systemic treatment or early sentinel-lymph-node biopsy, the procedure has a lower detection rate and a higher false-negative rate compared with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy done before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These limitations should be considered if biopsy is planned after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The optimum endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has progressed on non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) is unclear. The aim of the SoFEA trial was to assess a maximum double endocrine targeting approach with the steroidal anti-oestrogen fulvestrant in combination with continued oestrogen deprivation.",
        "Methods": "In a composite, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial done in the UK and South Korea, postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer (oestrogen receptor [ER] positive, progesterone receptor [PR] positive, or both) were eligible if they had relapsed or progressed with locally advanced or metastatic disease on an NSAI (given as adjuvant for at least 12 months or as first-line treatment for at least 6 months). Additionally, patients had to have adequate organ function and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular injection on day 1, followed by 250 mg doses on days 15 and 29, and then every 28 days) plus daily oral anastrozole (1 mg); fulvestrant plus anastrozole-matched placebo; or daily oral exemestane (25 mg). Randomisation was done with computer-generated permuted blocks, and stratification was by centre and previous use of an NSAI as adjuvant treatment or for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Participants and investigators were aware of assignment to fulvestrant or exemestane, but not of assignment to anastrozole or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers   (UK) and   (South Korea).",
        "Results/Findings": "Between March 26, 2004, and Aug 6, 2010, 723 patients underwent randomisation: 243 were assigned to receive fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 231 to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 249 to exemestane. Median PFS was 4·4 months (95% CI 3·4-5·4) in patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 4·8 months (3·6-5·5) in those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 3·4 months (3·0-4·6) in those assigned to exemestane. No difference was recorded between the patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole and fulvestrant plus placebo (hazard ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·83-1·21; log-rank p=0·98), or between those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo and exemestane (0·95, 0·79-1·14; log-rank p=0·56). 87 serious adverse events were reported: 36 in patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 22 in those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 29 in those assigned to exemestane. Grade 3-4 adverse events were rare; the most frequent were arthralgia (three in the group assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole; seven in that assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo; eight in that assigned to exemestane), lethargy (three; 11; 11), and nausea or vomiting (five; two; eight).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After loss of response to NSAIs in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, maximum double endocrine treatment with 250 mg fulvestrant combined with oestrogen deprivation is no better than either fulvestrant alone or exemestane.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The optimal timing and technique of breast reconstruction in patients who may require postmastectomy radiation therapy are controversial. To help surgeons make the best decisions, the authors reviewed the recent literature on this topic.",
        "Methods": "The authors searched the MEDLINE database for studies of radiation therapy and breast reconstruction with most patients treated after 1985 and mean follow-up of more than 1 year. Forty-nine articles were reviewed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Even with the latest prosthetic materials and modern radiation delivery techniques, the complication rate for implant-based breast reconstruction in patients undergoing postmastectomy radiation therapy is greater than 40 percent, and the extrusion rate is 15 percent. Modified sequencing of two-stage implant reconstruction, such that the expander is exchanged for the permanent implant before postmastectomy radiation therapy, results in higher rates of capsular contracture and is not generally feasible after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Current evidence suggests that postmastectomy radiation therapy also adversely affects autologous tissue reconstruction. Even with modern radiation delivery techniques, immediate implant-based or autologous tissue breast reconstruction can distort the chest wall and limit the ability to treat the targeted tissues without excessive exposure of the heart and lungs. In patients for whom postmastectomy radiation therapy appears likely but may not be required, \"delayed-immediate reconstruction,\" in which tissue expanders are placed at mastectomy, avoids the difficulties associated with radiation delivery after immediate reconstruction and preserves the opportunity for the aesthetic benefits of skin-sparing mastectomy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients who will receive or have already received postmastectomy radiation therapy, the optimal approach is delayed autologous tissue reconstruction after postmastectomy radiation therapy.

        "Background/Purpose": "The optimal surgical management of Paget's disease of the breast remains to be defined. Mastectomy has been the standard of care, but several institutions have recently advocated breast-conserving surgery, particularly for patients with minimal disease. In an effort to develop rational treatment guidelines, we examined our institutional experience with Paget's disease of the breast.",
        "Methods": "Patients with Paget's disease of the breast who had surgical therapy at our institution between 1949 and 1993 were reviewed. In addition to patient and tumor characteristics, charts were reviewed for treatment modalities, locoregional recurrence patterns, and survival. Subgroups were compared for differences in survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 104 patients met the study criteria. The most common presenting symptoms were nipple discharge and eczematous changes of the nipple/areola complex. Ninety-seven patients (93.2%) had an underlying invasive or noninvasive cancer associated with Paget's disease. Ninety-two patients (88.5%) underwent mastectomy, and 12 (11.5%) had a breast-conserving procedure. On univariate analysis, patients with age <60 years at diagnosis, stage II disease, positive lymph nodes, invasive disease, or a palpable mass had significantly lower 10-year disease-specific and recurrence-free survival. There were four locoregional recurrences (three after mastectomy and one after breast conservation). There were no significant differences in overall, disease-specific, or recurrence-free survival according to the type of surgery.",

The primary end point was disease free survival (DFS), and secondary end points were overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free interval (DMFi), new primary breast cancer, and safety. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined using Cox regression analysis. All analyses were by intention-to-treat principle.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1824 patients were assigned to either 2.5 years (n = 909) or five years (n = 915) of letrozole, with a median follow-up of 6.6 years. A DFS event occurred in 152 patients in the five-year group, compared with 163 patients in the 2.5-year group (HR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 1.16). OS (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.38) and DMFi (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.45) were not different between both groups. A reduction in occurrence of second primary breast cancer was observed with five years of treatment (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.81). Subgroup analysis did not identify patients who benefit from five-year extended therapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study showed no superiority of five years over 2.5 years of extended adjuvant letrozole after an initial five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.",

We recruited patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly allocated using central randomisation software (1:1 ratio) with minimisation without a random component, stratified by tumour stage, nodal stage, oestrogen receptor status, and age, to receive 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m ), epirubicin (90 mg/m ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m ) every 3 weeks for three cycles followed by paclitaxel (80 mg/m  on days 1 and 8) and carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL per min on day 1 or optionally, as per hospital preference, AUC 3 mg/mL per min on days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks for six cycles, or to receive nine cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin at the same dose and schedule as in the anthracycline group. Patients in both study groups received trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, loading dose 8 mg/kg) and pertuzumab (420 mg, loading dose 840 mg) concurrently with all chemotherapy cycles.

The median follow-up for all patients was 19 months (IQR 16-23 months). A pathological complete response was recorded in 141 (67%, 95% CI 60-73) of 212 patients in the anthracycline group and in 140 (68%, 61-74) of 206 in the non-anthracycline group (p=0·95). One patient randomly allocated to the non-anthracycline group did receive anthracyclines and was thus included in the anthracycline group for safety analyses; therefore, for the safety analyses there were 220 patients in the anthracycline group and 218 in the non-anthracycline group. Serious adverse events were reported in 61 (28%) of 220 patients in the anthracycline group and in 49 (22%) of 218 in the non-anthracycline group. The most common adverse events of any cause were grade 3 or worse neutropenia (in 131 [60%] of 220 patients in the anthracycline group vs 118 [54%] of 218 in the non-anthracycline group), grade 3 or worse diarrhoea (26 [12%] vs 37 [18%]), and grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy (66 [30%] vs 68 [31%]), with no substantial differences between the groups. Grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia was more common in the anthracycline group than in the non-anthracycline group (23 [10%] vs three [1%], p<0·0001). Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was rare in both groups (two [1%] of 220 vs 0 of 218). One patient in the anthracycline group died because of a pulmonary embolism, which was possibly treatment related.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In view of the high proportion of pathological complete responses recorded in both groups and the fact that febrile neutropenia was more frequent in the anthracycline group, omitting anthracyclines from neoadjuvant treatment regimens might be a preferred approach in the presence of dual HER2 blockade in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer.

        "Background/Purpose": "The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is a validated genomic predictor of outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer. Adjuvant! was developed using SEER registry data and results from the Early Breast Cancer Clinical Trialists' overview analyses to estimate outcome and benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. In this report we compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer. RS and Adjuvant! results were available from 668 tamoxifen-treated NSABP B-14 patients, 227 tamoxifen-treated NSABP B-20 patients, and 424 chemotherapy plus tamoxifen-treated B-20 patients. Adjuvant! results were also available from 1952 B-20 patients. The primary endpoint was distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the prognostic and predictive utility of RS and Adjuvant!. Both RS (P < 0.001) and Adjuvant! (P = 0.002) provided strong independent prognostic information in tamoxifen-treated patients. Combining RS and individual clinicopathologic characteristics provided greater prognostic discrimination than combining RS and the composite Adjuvant!. In the B-20 cohort with RS results (n = 651), RS was significantly predictive of chemotherapy benefit (interaction P = 0.031 for DRFI, P = 0.011 for overall survival [OS], P = 0.082 for disease-free survival [DFS]), but Adjuvant! was not (interaction P = 0.99, P = 0.311, and P = 0.357, respectively). However, in the larger B-20 sub-cohort (n = 1952), Adjuvant! was significantly predictive of chemotherapy benefit for OS (interaction P = 0.009) but not for DRFI (P = 0.219) or DFS (P = 0.099). Prognostic estimates can be optimized by combining RS and clinicopathologic information instead of simply combining RS and Adjuvant!. RS should be used for estimating relative chemotherapy benefit.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 989 patients (mean age, 54.6 years) with available RS who underwent NCT were identified. RS were low in 227 (23.0%) patients, intermediate in 450 (45.5%) patients, and high in 312 (31.5%) patients. Most patients had a T1 (431 [43.6%]) or T2 tumor (451 [45.6%]). Most had N0 disease (757 [76.5%]). Tumor grades were 1 (123 [12.4%]), 2 (517 [52.3%]), or 3 (349 [35.3%]). pCR was achieved by 42 (4.3%) patients.

For all patients, RS was associated with TTP (P = .01) and 2-year OS (P = .04). In multivariable Cox regression models among 69 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative cancer, RS was independently prognostic for TTP (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.86; P = .02) and 2-year OS (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.95; P = .013).",

        "Background/Purpose": "The objective is to prospectively determine the factors responsible for reconstruction failure and capsular contracture in mastectomized breast cancer patients who underwent immediate two-stage breast reconstruction with a tissue expander and implant, followed by radiotherapy. This is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized study. Between February 1998 and September 2006, we prospectively examined 141 consecutive patients, each of which received an implant after mastectomy, followed by chest wall radiotherapy at 46-50 Gy in 23-25 fractions. Radiotherapy was delivered during immediate post-mastectomy reconstruction. Patients were evaluated by both a radiation oncologist and a surgeon 24-36 months after treatment. The median follow-up duration was 37 months. According to Baker's classification, capsular contracture was grade 0, 1, or 2 in 67.5% of cases; it was grade 3 or 4 in 32.5% of cases. In total, 32 breast reconstruction failures required surgery. In univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with Baker grade 3 and 4 capsular contraction: adjuvant hormone therapy (P = 0.02), the surgeon (P = 0.04), and smoking (P = 0.05). Only one factor was significant in multivariate analysis: the surgeon (P = 0.009). Three factors were associated with immediate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction failure in multiple logistic regression analysis: T3 or T4 tumors (P = 0.0005), smoking (P = 0.001), and pN+ axillary status (P = 0.004). Patients with none, 1, 2, or all 3 factors have a probability of failure equal to 7, 15.7, 48.3, and 100%, respectively (P = 3.6 x 10(-6)). The model accurately predicts 80% of failures. Mastectomy, immediate reconstruction (expander followed by implant), and radiotherapy should be considered when conservative surgery is contraindicated. Three factors may be used to select patients likely to benefit from this technique with a low failure rate.",

The primary aims of the trial are to determine if removal of only SNs provides survival and regional control equivalent to those of axillary dissection, while diminishing the magnitude of surgically related side effects. In order to ensure consistency of the outcomes for this trial, a standardized method of SN surgery has been utilized for all cases. A secondary aim of the B32 trial is to evaluate whether patients with \"occult\" metastases in the SNs have worse survival. Accrual is taking place at 73 institutions in North America, and 217 surgeons are enrolling patients.",

Patients were enrolled without knowledge of hormone receptor status. The current study retrospectively evaluated the relationship between receptors and response to tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "Estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) were evaluated in 732 patients with DCIS (41% of original study population). An experienced central laboratory determined receptor status in all patient cases with available paraffin blocks (n = 449) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using comprehensively validated assays. Results for additional patients (n = 283) determined by various methods (primarily IHC) were available from enrolling institutions. Combined results were evaluated for benefit of tamoxifen by receptor status at 10 years and overall follow-up (median, 14.5 years).",
        "Results/Findings": "ER was positive in 76% of patients. Patients with ER-positive DCIS treated with tamoxifen (v placebo) showed significant decreases in subsequent breast cancer at 10 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; P < .001) and overall follow-up (HR, 0.60; P = .003), which remained significant in multivariable analysis (overall HR, 0.64; P = .003). Results were similar, but less significant, when subsequent ipsilateral and contralateral, invasive and noninvasive, breast cancers were considered separately. No significant benefit was observed in ER-negative DCIS. PgR and either receptor were positive in 66% and 79% of patients, respectively, and in general, neither was more predictive than ER alone.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients in NSABP B-24 with ER-positive DCIS receiving adjuvant tamoxifen after standard therapy showed significant reductions in subsequent breast cancer. The use of adjuvant tamoxifen should be considered for patients with DCIS.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The NCCN Task Force on Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor Testing in Breast Cancer by Immunohistochemistry was convened to critically evaluate the extent to which the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) biomarkers in breast cancer serve as prognostic and predictive factors in the adjuvant and metastatic settings, and the ability of immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of ER and PgR to provide an accurate assessment of the expression of these biomarkers in breast cancer tumor tissue. The task force is a multidisciplinary panel of 13 experts in breast cancer who are affiliated with NCCN member institutions and represent the disciplines of pathology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, and biostatistics. The main overall conclusions of the task force are ER is a strong predictor of response to endocrine therapy; ER status of all samples of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) should be evaluated by IHC; IHC measurements of PgR, although not as important clinically as ER, can provide useful information and should also be performed on all samples of invasive breast cancer or DCIS; IHC is the main testing strategy for evaluating ER and PgR in breast cancer and priority should be given to improve the quality of IHC testing methodologies; all laboratories performing IHC assays of ER and PgR should undertake formal validation studies to show both technical and clinical validation of the assay in use; and all laboratories performing IHC assays of hormone receptors in breast cancer should follow additional quality control and assurance measures as outlined in the upcoming guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists.",

        "Methods": "Patients (N = 2,305) were randomized to receive either four courses of standard AC therapy (group 1); intensified therapy, in which the same total dose of cyclophosphamide was administered in two courses (group 2); or intensified and increased therapy, in which the total dose of cyclophosphamide was doubled (group 3). The dose and intensity of doxorubicin were similar in all groups. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were determined using life-table estimates.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no significant difference in DFS (P = .30) or overall survival (P = .95) among the groups through 5 years. At 5 years, the DFS of women in group 1 was similar to that of women in group 2 (62% v 60%, respectively; P = .43) and to that of women in group 3 (62% v 64%, respectively; P = .59). The 5-year survival of women in group 1 was similar to that of women in group 2 (78% v 77%, respectively; P = .86) and to that of women in group 3 (78% v 77%, respectively; P = .82). Grade 4 toxicity increased in groups 2 and 3. Failure to note a difference in outcome among the groups was unrelated to either differences in amount and intensity of cyclophosphamide or to dose delays and intervals between courses of therapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Intensifying or intensifying and increasing the total dose of cyclophosphamide failed to significantly improve either DFS or overall survival in any group.

        "Background/Purpose": "The National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research commissioned a structured literature review on the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as a background article for the State of the Science Conference on Diagnosis and Management of DCIS.",
        "Methods": "Published studies were identified and abstracted from MEDLINE and other sources. We include articles published between 1965 and January 31, 2009; 374 publications were identified that addressed DCIS incidence, staging, treatment, and outcomes in adult women.",
        "Results/Findings": "In the United States, DCIS incidence rose from 1.87 per 100 000 in 1973-1975 to 32.5 in 2004. Incidence increased in all ages but more so in women older than 50 years. Increased use of mammography explains some but not all of the increased incidence. Risk factors for incident DCIS include older age and family history. Although tamoxifen treatment prevented both invasive breast cancer and DCIS, raloxifene treatment decreased incidence of invasive breast cancer but not DCIS. Among patients with DCIS, magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than mammography for detecting multicentric disease and estimating tumor size. Because about 15% of patients with DCIS identified on core needle biopsy are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after excision or mastectomy, the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy after excision is relevant to surgical management of DCIS. Most studies demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy is feasible after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Younger age, positive surgical margins, tumor size and grade, and comedo necrosis were consistently related to DCIS recurrence. DCIS outcomes after either mastectomy or BCS plus radiation therapy were superior to BCS alone. Tamoxifen treatment after DCIS diagnosis reduced risk of recurrent disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Scientific questions deserving further investigation include the relationship between mammography use and DCIS incidence and whether imaging technologies and treatment guidelines can be modified to focus on lesions that are most likely to become clinically problematic.",

The OTOASOR (Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla - Surgery Or Radiotherapy) trial compares completion of axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) to regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis (pN1sn) in stage I-II breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Patients with primary invasive breast cancer (cN0 and cT ≤ 3 cm) were randomized before surgery for cALND (standard treatment) or RNI (investigational treatment). Sentinel lymph nodes (SN) were investigated with serial sectioning at 0.5 mm levels by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Investigational treatment arm patients received 50 Gy RNI instead of cALND. Adjuvant treatment and follow up were performed according to the actual guidelines. Between August 2002 and June 2009, 1054 patients were randomized for cALND and 1052 patients for RNI. SN was evaluated in 2073 patients and was positive in 526 patients (25.4%). 474 cases were evaluable (244 in the cALND and 230 in the RNI arm), and in the cALND group 94 of 244 patients (38.5%) who underwent completion axillary surgery has additional positive nodes. The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors. Primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).",
        "Results/Findings": "Mean follow-up was 97 months (Q1-Q3: 80-120). Axillary recurrence was 2.0% in cALND arm vs. 1.7% in RNI arm (p = 1.00). OS at 8 years was 77.9% vs. 84.8% (p = 0.060), and DFS was 72.1% in cALND arm and 77.4% after RNI (p = 0.51). The results show that RNI is statistically not inferior to cALND treatment.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The long term follow-up results of this prospective-randomized trial suggest that RNI without cALND does not increase the risk of axillary failure in selected patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (cT ≤ 3 cm, cN0) and pN1(sn).

        "Results/Findings": "There were 1,579 women in the PLAC-LET group (median time from tamoxifen, 2.8 years) and 804 in the PLAC-PLAC group. Patients in the PLAC-LET group were younger; had a better performance status; and were more likely to have had node-positive disease, axillary dissection, and adjuvant chemotherapy than those in the PLAC-PLAC group. At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, disease-free survival (DFS; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.61; P < .0001) and distant DFS (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.74; P = .004) were superior in the PLAC-LET group. More self-reported new diagnoses of osteoporosis and significantly more clinical fractures occurred in the women who took LET (5.2% v 3.1%, P = .02).",

        "Methods": "MINDACT was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 112 academic and community hospitals in nine European countries. Patients aged 18-70 years, with histologically confirmed primary invasive breast cancer (stage T1, T2, or operable T3) with up to three positive lymph nodes, no distant metastases, and a WHO performance status of 0-1 were enrolled and their genomic risk (using the MammaPrint 70-gene signature) and clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online) were determined. Patients with low clinical and low genomic risk results did not receive chemotherapy, and patients with high clinical and high genomic risk did receive chemotherapy (mostly anthracycline-based or taxane-based, or a combination thereof). Patients with discordant risk results (ie, patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, and those with low clinical risk but high genomic risk) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy or not based on either the clinical risk or the genomic risk. Randomisation was done centrally and used a minimisation technique that was stratified by institution, risk group, and clinical-pathological characteristics. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was to test whether the distant metastasis-free survival rate at 5 years in patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk not receiving chemotherapy had a lower boundary of the 95% CI above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%. In the primary test population of patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who adhered to the treatment allocation of no chemotherapy and had no change in risk post-enrolment. Here, we present updated follow-up as well as an exploratory analysis of a potential age effect (≤50 years vs >50 years) and an analysis by nodal status for patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative disease. These analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and the European Clinical Trials database, EudraCT2005-002625-31. Recruitment is complete and further long-term follow-up is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 8, 2007, and July 11, 2011, 6693 patients were enrolled. On Feb 26, 2020, median follow-up was 8·7 years (IQR 7·8-9·7). The updated 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate for patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk receiving no chemotherapy (primary test population, n=644) was 95·1% (95% CI 93·1-96·6), which is above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%, supporting the previous analysis and proving MINDACT as a positive de-escalation trial. Patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (n=749) or not (n=748); this was the intention-to-treat population. The 8-year estimates for distant metastasis-free survival in the intention-to-treat population were 92·0% (95% CI 89·6-93·8) for chemotherapy versus 89·4% (86·8-91·5) for no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0·66; 95% CI 0·48-0·92). An exploratory analysis confined to the subset of patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease (1358 [90.7%] of 1497 randomly assigned patients, of whom 676 received chemotherapy and 682 did not) shows different effects of chemotherapy administration on 8-year distant metastasis-free survival according to age: 93·6% (95% CI 89·3-96·3) with chemotherapy versus 88·6% (83·5-92·3) without chemotherapy in 464 women aged 50 years or younger (absolute difference 5·0 percentage points [SE 2·8, 95% CI -0·5 to 10·4]) and 90·2% (86·8-92·7) versus 90·0% (86·6-92·6) in 894 women older than 50 years (absolute difference 0·2 percentage points [2·1, -4·0 to 4·4]). The 8-year distant metastasis-free survival in the exploratory analysis by nodal status in these patients was 91·7% (95% CI 88·1-94·3) with chemotherapy and 89·2% (85·2-92·2) without chemotherapy in 699 node-negative patients (absolute difference 2·5 percentage points [SE 2·3, 95% CI -2·1 to 7·2]) and 91·2% (87·2-94·0) versus 89·9% (85·8-92·8) for 658 patients with one to three positive nodes (absolute difference 1·3 percentage points [2·4, -3·5 to 6·1]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With a more mature follow-up approaching 9 years, the 70-gene signature shows an intact ability of identifying among women with high clinical risk, a subgroup, namely patients with a low genomic risk, with an excellent distant metastasis-free survival when treated with endocrine therapy alone. For these women the magnitude of the benefit from adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy remains small (2·6 percentage points) and is not enhanced by nodal positivity. However, in an underpowered exploratory analysis this benefit appears to be age-dependent, as it is only seen in women younger than 50 years where it reaches a clinically relevant threshold of 5 percentage points. Although, possibly due to chemotherapy-induced ovarian function suppression, it should be part of informed, shared decision making. Further study is needed in younger women, who might need reinforced endocrine therapy to forego chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "At initial diagnosis, patients were randomized 1:1 to either the LRT or ST group. All the patients were given ST either immediately after randomization or after surgical resection of the intact primary tumor.",
        "Results/Findings": "The trial enrolled 274 patients: 138 in the LRT group and 136 in the ST group. Hazard of death was 34% lower in the LRT group than in the ST group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.88; p = 0.005). Unplanned subgroup analyses showed that the risk of death was statistically lower in the LRT group than in the ST group with respect to estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)(+) (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46-0.91; p = 0.01), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)/neu(-) (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.91; p = 0.01), patients younger than 55 years (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.38-0.86; p = 0.007), and patients with solitary bone-only metastases (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23-0.98; p = 0.04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In the current trial, improvement in 36-month survival was not observed with upfront surgery for stage IV breast cancer patients. However, a longer follow-up study (median, 40 months) showed statistically significant improvement in median survival. When locoregional treatment in de novo stage IV BC is discussed with the patient as an option, practitioners must consider age, performance status, comorbidities, tumor type, and metastatic disease burden.",

Studies from our institution have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of treating women with adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. However, the literature regarding the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in a pregnant patient is scarce. In this article, we describe the successful treatment of a woman at 27 weeks of pregnancy with recurrent HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer who was symptomatic from multiple liver metastases. Per our review of the literature and to our knowledge, she is the first patient to be treated with weekly vinorelbine plus trastuzumab. Our patient had near complete resolution of her disease and delivered a healthy male infant at 34 weeks of gestation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The major prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer is the presence of metastases in axillary lymph nodes. The authors developed a mathematical model, based on 1446 complete axillary dissections performed in Milan between 1983 and 1986, and determined the following: (1) the sample size from Level I necessary for a 90% certainty degree of N0 axillary status; (2) the probability of residual tumor in the axilla after axillary sampling from Level I; and (3) the maximum number of involved axillary nodes in Levels I, II, and III to be expected (90% certainty) after sampling from Level I. Thus, this model permitted the determination of the cutoff level for a true N0 axillary status when only a few nodes are sampled from Level I. The cutoff level for a T1 primary tumor is ten axillary nodes removed and found uninvolved. Also, this model provides guidance in managing possible residual tumor after an incomplete axillary dissection. This information is important in indicating adjuvant axillary radiation therapy and chemotherapy or hormone therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The main objective of the present study aims at comparing the long-term efficacy of breast conserving surgery (BCS) vs. mastectomy (M) based on a randomized design. The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) conducted the trial (DBCG-82TM) from January 1983 to March 1989 recruiting 1154 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Follow-up time ended 1(st) May 2006 with a median follow-up time of 19.6 years (time span 17.1-23.3 years). Eligibility criteria included a one-sided, unifocal, primary operable breast carcinoma, patient age below 70 years, probability of satisfactory cosmetic outcome with BCS, and no evidence of disseminated disease. The patients accrued were grouped into three subsets: correctly randomized, suspicion of randomization error, and declining randomization. The main analyses focus on the subgroup of 793 correctly randomized patients representing 70% of the complete series. 10-year recurrence free survival (RFS) and 20-year overall survival (OS) based on intent to treat did not reveal significant differences in outcome between breast conserving surgery vs. mastectomy, p=0.95 and p=0.10, respectively. Including the complete series comprising 1133 eligible patients based on treatment in fact given similarly no significant difference between surgical options could be traced in outcome of 10-year RFS and 20-year OS, p=0.94 and p=0.24, respectively. The pattern of recurrences as a first event in breast conservation vs. mastectomy did not differ significantly irrespective of site, p=0.27. Looking into the type of local relapse, viz., new primaries vs. true recurrences, it appeared that new primaries were significantly associated to BCS, while true recurrences dominated among M treated patients (p<0.001). In conclusion, long-term data indicate that BCS in eligible patients proves as effective as mastectomy both regarding local tumour control, RFS and OS. Local failures as a first event consistent with new primaries are strongly associated with BCS, whereas true recurrence predominates after mastectomy.",

The median time to recurrence was 25 months (range, 3 to 98 months). Fourteen patients were treated with a combination of surgery and systemic therapy. Resection of the reconstructed breast was performed in only three patients. Complete local control of the recurrent disease was achieved in 17 patients (74%). Nine patients (39%) developed distant metastatic disease. At a median follow-up of 26 months, 14 of 23 patients (61%) are alive without evidence of disease, and 7 (30%) have died from breast cancer.",

The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient.",
        "Results/Findings": "Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were 51, 22, and 27 percent, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 6.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.6), 14.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.3 to 20.3), and 30.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.6 to 37.4). The rate in the low-risk group was significantly lower than that in the high-risk group (P<0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, the recurrence score provided significant predictive power that was independent of age and tumor size (P<0.001). The recurrence score was also predictive of overall survival (P<0.001) and could be used as a continuous function to predict distant recurrence in individual patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The late effects of cancer treatment have recently gained a worldwide ubiquitous interest among reproductive endocrinologists, oncologists, and all health care providers. Despite many publications on this subject, there are many equivocal issues necessitating summary. The case for and against using GnRH-agonist for fertility preservation is summarized with the rationale that preventing ovarian failure may be better than treating it.",
        "Methods": "We searched Medline in the last 10 years using terms: 'fertility preservation', 'female chemotherapy', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues', 'GnRH agonists' 'gonadotoxicity', and 'cancer treatment'. We included mainly publications from the past 7 years, but did not exclude previous, commonly referenced publications. Here, we summarize the various methods available for fertility preservation and minimizing chemotherapy induced gonadotoxicity.",
        "Results/Findings": "Until now, 20 studies (15 retrospective and 5 randomized controlled trial) have reported on 2038 patients treated with GnRH-a in parallel to chemotherapy, showing a significant decrease in premature ovarian failure (POF) rate in survivors versus 8 studies reporting on 509 patients, with negative results. Patients treated with GnRH-a in parallel to chemotherapy preserved their cyclic ovarian function in 91% of cases as compared to 41% of controls, with a pregnancy rate of 19 - 71% in the treated patients. Furthermore, over 10 recent meta-analyses have concluded that GnRH-a are beneficial and may decrease the risk of POF in survivors. Because most of the methods involving ovarian or egg cryopreservation are not yet clinically established and unequivocally successful, these young patients deserve to be informed with all the various modalities to minimize gonadal damage and preserve ovarian function and future fertility. Combining the various modalities for a specific patient may increase the odds of preservation of future fertility.",

We aimed to test the benefits of radiotherapy schedules using fraction sizes larger than 2.0 Gy in terms of local-regional tumour control, normal tissue responses, quality of life, and economic consequences in women prescribed post-operative radiotherapy.",
        "Methods": "Between 1999 and 2001, 2215 women with early breast cancer (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) at 23 centres in the UK were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy over 5 weeks or 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2.67 Gy over 3 weeks. Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged over 18 years, did not have an immediate reconstruction, and were available for follow-up.

        "Results/Findings": "1105 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group and 1110 to the 40 Gy group. After a median follow up of 6.0 years (IQR 5.0-6.2) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 2.2% (95% CI 1.3-3.1) in the 40 Gy group and 3.3% (95% CI 2.2 to 4.5) in the 50 Gy group, representing an absolute difference of -0.7% (95% CI -1.7% to 0.9%)--ie, the absolute difference in local-regional relapse could be up to 1.7% better and at most 1% worse after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments indicated lower rates of late adverse effects after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy.",

After a median follow up of 5.1 years (IQR 4.4-6.0) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 3.6% (95% CI 2.2-5.1) after 50 Gy, 3.5% (95% CI 2.1-4.3) after 41.6 Gy, and 5.2% (95% CI 3.5-6.9) after 39 Gy. The estimated absolute differences in 5-year local-regional relapse rates compared with 50 Gy were 0.2% (95% CI -1.3% to 2.6%) after 41.6 Gy and 0.9% (95% CI -0.8% to 3.7%) after 39 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments suggested lower rates of late adverse effects after 39 Gy than with 50 Gy, with an HR for late change in breast appearance (photographic) of 0.69 (95% CI 0.52-0.91, p=0.01). From a planned meta-analysis with the pilot trial, the adjusted estimates of alpha/beta value for tumour control was 4.6 Gy (95% CI 1.1-8.1) and for late change in breast appearance (photographic) was 3.4 Gy (95% CI 2.3-4.5).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The data are consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancer and the dose-limiting normal tissues respond similarly to change in radiotherapy fraction size. 41.6 Gy in 13 fractions was similar to the control regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions in terms of local-regional tumour control and late normal tissue effects, a result consistent with the result of START Trial B. A lower total dose in a smaller number of fractions could offer similar rates of tumour control and normal tissue damage as the international standard fractionation schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions.",

Longer-term efficacy of letrozole, especially survival, was of particular interest because the median follow-up of the first interim analysis was only 2.5 years. Efficacy was difficult to assess because more than 60% of placebo patients crossed over to letrozole after being unblinded.",
        "Methods": "Two statistical approaches were used to adjust for the potential effects of treatment crossover: one was based on the inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) Cox model and the other on a Cox model with time-dependent covariates.",
        "Results/Findings": "With a median follow-up of 64 months, the hazard ratios (HRs) of letrozole and placebo from the IPCW analyses were HR of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.61; P < .001) for DFS, HR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.61; P < .001) for distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and HR of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.71; P < .001) for overall survival (OS). The results from the analyses based on the Cox model with time-dependent covariates were similar for letrozole and placebo: HR of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.72; P < .001) for DFS, HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88; P = .004) for DDFS, and HR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.96; P = .02) for OS.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Exploratory analyses based on longer follow-up and adjusting for treatment crossover suggest that extended adjuvant letrozole was superior to placebo in DFS, DDFS, and OS.",

        "Methods": "Four hundred sixty-six women ages 20 to 45 years at the time of diagnosis of a stage I to III breast cancer were recruited between January 1998 and July 2002. Patients completed monthly bleeding calendars from the time of study recruitment. Updated medical history data were obtained at 6-month intervals.",
        "Results/Findings": "Most women received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC); doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (ACT); or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Approximately 41% of women experienced an initial 6 months of CIA, and an additional 29% had at least 1 year of CIA. Approximately half of the women with 6 months of CIA and 29% of those with 1 year of CIA resumed bleeding within the subsequent 3 years, usually in the year after their amenorrheic episode. Resumption of bleeding differed significantly by treatment regimen after 6 months of CIA (P = .002; 68% with AC, 57% with ACT, and 23% with CMF), but not after 1 year of CIA (P = .5). Of the 23% of women who experienced an initial 2-year period of CIA, 10% resumed bleeding within the ensuing 3 years after their amenorrheic episode, but none had regular menses.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A considerable proportion of women treated with chemotherapy will experience periods of CIA, but many will resume bleeding. Newer treatment regimens such as ACT appear to have a higher resumption of bleeding compared with CMF. This finding may have implications for choice of anti-estrogen treatment and for future potential pregnancies/fertility.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The impact of treatment on subsequent fertility and the safety of childbearing are major complicating factors for young women diagnosed with breast cancer. As national data indicate women are postponing first pregnancy to older ages; therefore, many young patients are seeking clinical guidance regarding the safety of conception and treatment options that may not prevent subsequent pregnancy. Newly developed chemotherapy protocols of brief duration have improved life expectancy enabling some women to consider childbearing. This study was conducted to compare prognosis among breast cancer patients with and without a subsequent pregnancy. Medical record review of female members of a Northern California prepaid health care plan enabled the identification of 107 women with one or more subsequent pregnancies and 344 cases without a pregnancy, who were diagnosed between 1968 and 1995. Sets were matched on age, year and stage at diagnosis, months of survival and recurrence status at conception. Among the matched sets, neither risk of recurrence nor death differed significantly by subsequent pregnancy history during an average 12 years of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] recurrence: 1.2 [0.8, 2.0]; adjusted HR death: 1.0 [0.6, 1.9]). Women interested in preserving their fertility and considering pregnancy are a self-selected population; therefore, to reduce potential bias, cases were matched on recurrence status at time of conception. Although the number of cases was limited, subgroup analyzes indicated a small, nonsignificant adverse effect among women who conceived within 12 months of diagnosis. This analysis of carefully matched cases provides reassurance that long-term prognosis was not adversely affected by subsequent pregnancy.",

        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women with ER-positive, invasive, nonmetastatic, and operable or locally advanced potentially operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant tamoxifen (20 mg daily), anastrozole (1 mg daily), or a combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole for 3 months. The tumor objective response (OR) was assessed by both caliper and ultrasound. Comparisons were also made of clinical response with ultrasound response, actual and feasible surgery with feasible surgery at baseline, OR in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers, and tolerability.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were no significant differences in OR in the intent-to-treat population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination. In patients who were assessed as requiring mastectomy at baseline (n = 124), 44% of patients received breast-conserving surgery (BCS) after anastrozole compared with 31% of patients after tamoxifen (P = .23); this difference became significant for patients who were deemed feasible for BCS by their surgeon (46% v 22%, respectively; P = .03). The OR for patients with HER2-positive cancer (n = 34) was 58% for anastrozole compared with 22% for tamoxifen (P = .18). All treatments were well tolerated.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neoadjuvant anastrozole is as effective and well tolerated as tamoxifen in ER-positive operable breast cancer in postmenopausal women, but the hypothesis that clinical outcome might predict for long-term outcome in adjuvant therapy was not fulfilled.",

Secondary and exploratory end points included toxicity assessment, RR in cisplatin versus carboplatin, and RR in molecularly defined subgroups, including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients (N = 86; 69 as first-line therapy) received cisplatin (n = 43) or carboplatin (n = 43). RR was 25.6% (95% CI, 16.8% to 36%) and was numerically higher with cisplatin (32.6%) than with carboplatin (18.7%). RR was 54.5% in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 11). In patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 66), exploratory analyses showed that a BRCA-like genomic instability signature (n = 32) discriminated responding and nonresponding tumors (mean homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity/homologous recombination deficiency-large-scale state transitions [HRD-LOH/HRD-LST] scores were 12.68 and 5.11, respectively), whereas predefined analysis by p63/p73 expression status (n = 61), p53 and PIK3CA mutation status (n = 53), or PAM50 gene expression subtype (n = 55) did not.

In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The free muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (MS-TRAM) and deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps involve transferring skin and subcutaneous tissue from the lower abdominal area and have many features that make them well suited for breast reconstruction. The robust blood supply of the free flap reduces the risk of fat necrosis and also enables aggressive shaping of the flap for breast reconstruction to optimize the aesthetic outcome. In addition, the free MS-TRAM flap and DIEP flap require minimal donor-site sacrifice in most cases. With proper patient selection and safe surgical technique, the free MS-TRAM flap and DIEP flap can transfer the lower abdominal skin and subcutaneous tissue to provide an aesthetically pleasing breast reconstruction with minimal donor-site morbidity.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The first reported effective adjuvant combination regimen for patients with operable breast cancer comprised oral cyclophosphamide (C) days 1-14 with intravenous methotrexate (M) and fluorouracil (F) on days 1 and 8, repeated every 28 days ('classical' CMF). These drugs have since been extensively used with or without endocrine therapies and/or other cytotoxics, as well as with radiation therapy to the chest wall yielding conflicting results. Although doses and schedules have varied widely, the combination of these three drugs has been generically referred to as CMF. Evidence exists that reducing the dose and/or altering the schedule of CMF ('modified' CMF) have compromised its efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. Reduction below standard dose of a similar regimen also gave inferior results in the adjuvant setting. In fact, the recently reported improved outcome of adding radiation therapy to CMF was only demonstrated in comparisons with a 'modified' CMF. Furthermore, trials in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which did not demonstrate any significant benefit for the addition of adjuvant CMF to tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone, also used 'modified' CMF. Therefore, adherence to the 'classical' dose and schedule is recommended when CMF is used in adjuvant therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The finding of a decrease in contralateral breast cancer incidence following tamoxifen administration for adjuvant therapy led to the concept that the drug might play a role in breast cancer prevention. To test this hypothesis, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) in 1992.",
        "Methods": "Women (N=13388) at increased risk for breast cancer because they 1) were 60 years of age or older, 2) were 35-59 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1.66%, or 3) had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=6707) or 20 mg/day tamoxifen (n=6681) for 5 years. Gail's algorithm, based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors, was used to estimate the probability (risk) of occurrence of breast cancer over time.",
        "Results/Findings": "Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two-sided P<.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger (44%), 50-59 years (51%), and 60 years or older (55%); risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002). Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors was seen. Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles'), and spine fractures was observed. The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older. All endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group were stage I (localized disease); no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group. No liver cancers or increase in colon, rectal, ovarian, or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group. The rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group; these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer. Despite side effects resulting from administration of tamoxifen, its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease.",

A complete mastectomy may be performed using modified skin incisions to avoid the sacrifice of unnecessary breast skin. The type of skin-sparing incision used varies based on the exact location of the tumor and the size of the breast, but it always includes the nipple-areola complex and the biopsy site. The presence of local recurrence, distant disease, or death was determined in 50 consecutive patients who had skin-sparing mastectomies and immediate breast reconstruction between 1985 and 1991 to ascertain the safety of the procedure. The period of follow-up ranged from 23 to 121 months, with a mean of 57 months and a median of 51.5 months. There was no local recurrence, active distant disease was present in five patients, two patients died of distant disease, and there were two unrelated deaths.",

        "Methods": "Tumor response at surgery and its association with long-term outcome of 6,377 patients with primary breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy in seven randomized trials were analyzed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly superior in patients with no invasive and no in situ residuals in breast or nodes (n = 955) compared with patients with residual ductal carcinoma in situ only (n = 309), no invasive residuals in breast but involved nodes (n = 186), only focal-invasive disease in the breast (n = 478), and gross invasive residual disease (n = 4,449; P < .001). Hazard ratios for DFS comparing patients with or without pCR were lowest when defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals (0.446) and increased monotonously when in situ residuals (0.523), no invasive breast residuals but involved nodes (0.623), and focal-invasive disease (0.727) were included in the definition. pCR was associated with improved DFS in luminal B/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative (P = .005), HER2-positive/nonluminal (P < .001), and triple-negative (P < .001) tumors but not in luminal A (P = .39) or luminal B/HER2-positive (P = .45) breast cancer. pCR in HER2-positive (nonluminal) and triple-negative tumors was associated with excellent prognosis.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "pCR defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals in breast and nodes can best discriminate between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes.

We analyzed the efficacy of RT with 10 years follow-up on both the overall risk of local recurrence (LR) and related to clinical, histologic, and treatment factors.",
        "Methods": "After complete LE, women with DCIS were randomly assigned to no further treatment or RT (50 Gy). One thousand ten women with mostly (71%) mammographically detected DCIS were included. The median follow-up was 10.5 years.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 10-year LR-free rate was 74% in the group treated with LE alone compared with 85% in the women treated by LE plus RT (log-rank P < .0001; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53). The risk of DCIS and invasive LR was reduced by 48% (P = .0011) and 42% (P = .0065) respectively. Both groups had similar low risks of metastases and death. At multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with an increased LR risk were young age (< or = 40 years; HR = 1.89), symptomatic detection (HR = 1.55), intermediately or poorly differentiated DCIS (as opposed to well-differentiated DCIS; HR = 1.85 and HR = 1.61 respectively), cribriform or solid growth pattern (as opposed to clinging/micropapillary subtypes; HR = 2.39 and HR = 2.25 respectively), doubtful margins (HR = 1.84), and treatment by LE alone (HR = 1.82). The effect of RT was homogeneous across all assessed risk factors.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With long-term follow-up, RT after LE for DCIS continued to reduce the risk of LR, with a 47% reduction at 10 years. All patient subgroups benefited from RT.",

Compared with BCT, MRM resulted in better local control, but did not affect overall survival or time to distant metastases. We report 20-year follow-up results.",
        "Methods": "The EORTC 10801 trial was open for accrual between 1980 and 1986 in eight centres in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, and South Africa. 448 patients were randomised to BCT and 420 to MRM. Randomisation was done centrally, stratifying patients by institute, carcinoma stage (I or II), and menopausal status. BCT comprised of lumpectomy and complete axillary clearance, followed by breast radiotherapy and a tumour-bed boost. The primary endpoint was time to distant metastasis. This analysis was done on all eligible patients, as they were randomised.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 22·1 years (IQR 18·5-23·8), 175 patients (42%) had distant metastases in the MRM group versus 207 (46%) in the BCT group. Furthermore, 506 patients (58%) died (232 [55%] in the MRM group and 274 [61%] in the BCT group). No significant difference was observed between BCT and MRM for time to distant metastases (hazard ratio 1·13, 95% CI 0·92-1·38; p=0·23) or for time to death (1·11, 0·94-1·33; 0·23). Cumulative incidence of distant metastases at 20 years was 42·6% (95% CI 37·8-47·5) in the MRM group and 46·9% (42·2-51·6) in the BCT group. 20-year overall survival was estimated to be 44·5% (95% CI 39·3-49·5) in the MRM group and 39·1% (34·4-43·9) in the BCT group. There was no difference between the groups in time to distant metastases or overall survival by age (time to distant metastases: <50 years 1·09 [95% CI 0·79-1·51] vs ≥50 years 1·16 [0·90-1·50]; overall survival <50 years 1·17 [0·86-1·59] vs ≥50 years 1·10 [0·89-1·37]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "BCT, including radiotherapy, offered as standard care to patients with early breast cancer seems to be justified, since long-term follow-up in this trial showed similar survival to that after mastectomy.",

Plasma concentrations of the active tamoxifen metabolite endoxifen are associated with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype. We examined the effects of concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, which are CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors commonly prescribed to treat hot flashes in women who take tamoxifen, and genotypes for genes that encode tamoxifen-metabolizing enzymes on plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites.",
        "Methods": "Eighty patients with newly diagnosed with breast cancer who were beginning tamoxifen therapy (20 mg/day orally), 24 of whom were taking CYP2D6 inhibitors, were genotyped for common alleles of the CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A5, and sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 genes. Plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites were measured after 1 and 4 months of tamoxifen therapy. Differences in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites between genotype groups were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among all women, plasma endoxifen concentrations after 4 months of tamoxifen therapy were statistically significantly lower in subjects with a CYP2D6 homozygous variant genotype (20.0 nM, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.1 to 28.9 nM) or a heterozygous genotype (43.1 nM, 95% CI = 33.3 to 52.9 nM) than in those with a homozygous wild-type genotype (78.0 nM, 95%CI = 65.9 to 90.1 nM) (both P = .003). Among subjects who carried a homozygous wild-type genotype, the mean plasma endoxifen concentration for those who were using CYP2D6 inhibitors was 58% lower than that for those who were not (38.6 nM versus 91.4 nM, difference = -52.8 nM, 95% CI = -86.1 to -19.5 nM, P = .0025). The plasma endoxifen concentration was slightly reduced in women taking venlafaxine, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, whereas the plasma endoxifen concentration was reduced substantially in subjects who took paroxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6). Genetic variations of CYP2C9, CYP3A5, or SULT1A1 had no statistically significant associations with plasma concentrations of tamoxifen or its metabolites.",

Anastrozole had a significant advantage over tamoxifen in terms of TTP (median TTP of 11.1 and 5.6 months for anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively; two-sided P =.005). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 1.44 (lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 1.16). Both treatments were well tolerated. However, thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients who received anastrozole compared with those who received tamoxifen (4.1% v 8.2% [thromboembolic events] and 1.2% v 3.8% [vaginal bleeding], respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole satisfied the predefined criteria for equivalence to tamoxifen. Furthermore, we observed both a significant increase in TTP and a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding with anastrozole.

        "Background/Purpose": "The efficacy and side-effects of megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were compared in a prospectively randomized study. The dosage of MA was 2 X 80 mg p.o. or MPA 2 X 500 mg p.o. daily, given as a secondary hormonal treatment, mostly after previous treatment with tamoxifen. Ninety-eight patients entered the study and 92 were evaluable for effect, 48 patients on MA and 44 on MPA. Age, main tumor site and prior treatment were not different, but there was a preponderance of ER-negative tumors in the MA group. Responses appeared to be more frequent in the MPA-treated group (25% vs. 43%), predominantly in bone lesions, 12% for MA and 45% for MPA. Median progression-free survival was comparable, 15 vs. 10 months, and overall survival was not different (20 vs. 16 months). Toxicity was frequent, occurring in 83% vs. 74% of patients: increased appetite, nausea and dizziness in more than 20%, and a preponderance of pyrosis and breathlessness on MA and hot flashes, sweating and tremors on MPA. Cushingoid symptoms were present in about a quarter of the patients treated for more than 3 months. The occurrence of thrombo-embolic episodes and cardiovascular events was evenly distributed. Patients on MPA had more often increase in body weight, systolic blood pressure and serum creatinine than those treated with MA. It is concluded that MPA may be more effective for treatment of bone metastases, at the expense of more progestational side-effects. The occurrence of Cushingoid effects is frequent but similar in both arms, while the incidence of cardiovascular or thrombo-embolic events cannot be related to the use of either compound.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The discordance in oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status between primary and recurrent breast cancer is being intensively investigated and a large amount of data have been produced. However, results from different studies are heterogeneous and often conflicting. To highlight this issue, a meta-analysis of published data was performed.",
        "Methods": "A literature search was performed using Medline, and all the studies published from 1983 to 2011 comparing changes in ER, PgR and/or HER2 status in patients with matched breast primary and recurrent tumours were included. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled discordance proportions.",
        "Results/Findings": "We selected 48 articles, mostly reporting retrospective studies. Thirty-three, 24 and 31 articles were focused on ER, PgR and HER2 changes, respectively. A total of 4200, 2739 and 2987 tumours were evaluated for ER, PgR and HER2 discordance, respectively. The heterogeneity between study-specific discordance proportions was high for ER (I(2)=91%, p<0.0001), PgR (I(2)=79%, p<0.0001) and HER2 (I(2)=77%, p<0.0001). Pooled discordance proportions were 20% (95% confidence interval (CI): 16-35%) for ER, 33% (95% CI: 29-38%) for PgR and 8% (95% CI: 6-10%) for HER2. Pooled proportions of tumours shifting from positive to negative and from negative to positive were 24% and 14% for ER (p=0.0183), respectively. The same figures were 46% and 15% for PgR (p<0.0001), and 13% and 5% for HER2 (p=0.0004).",

        "Background/Purpose": "The diagnosis of breast cancer or melanoma in a pregnant patient presents some unique and difficult challenges for both patients and providers. Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become an attractive alternative to elective lymphadenectomy procedures for patients with breast cancer and melanoma. However, there is no data on the safety or utility of sentinel node mapping in pregnant patients. Therefore, we reviewed our experience with mapping in gravid patients. Academic institutions throughout North Carolina were asked to contribute cases of mapping performed during pregnancy. A total of nine women underwent sentinel node mapping during pregnancy. All nine were Caucasian with an average age of 32. SLN were found in all cases and mapping procedures were for breast cancer (three), and melanoma (six). There were no adverse reactions to the SLN procedures and one patient developed a seroma at a biopsy site. All went on to have term deliveries without known adverse effects. This limited experience shows that SLN mapping procedures are feasible in pregnant patients. However, this is not a general endorsement of such procedures in pregnant patients. We suggest that potential risks of vital dye or radioactive tracers be clearly explained to the parents when the mother is a candidate for a mapping procedure, and be balanced against the risk of delaying therapy or omitting nodal staging.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The Danish Breast Cancer Group Internal Mammary Node study demonstrated improved 8-year overall survival (OS) with internal mammary node irradiation (IMNI) in patients with node-positive early breast cancer. Here, we present long-term results from the Danish Breast Cancer Group Internal Mammary Node study cohort.",
        "Methods": "This nationwide, prospective cohort study allocated patients with node-positive early breast cancer to adjuvant radiotherapy with or without IMNI depending on cancer laterality. Patients with right-sided cancer received IMNI. Patients with left-sided cancer were treated without IMNI because of risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Other treatment was independent of laterality. The primary study end point was OS. Secondary end points were distant recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Analyses were by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "During 2003-2007, 3,089 women were allocated to IMNI (right-sided, n = 1,491) or no IMNI (left-sided, n = 1,598). With a median follow-up of 14.8 years, 589 patients with and 701 patients without IMNI had died. The corresponding 15-year OS rates were 60.1% and 55.4%. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.96;   = .007) in favor of IMNI. The 15-year risk of developing distant recurrence was 35.6% (523 recurrences) and 38.6% (602 recurrences) with vs. without IMNI (adjusted HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99;   = .04]). The 15-year breast cancer mortality with IMNI was 31.7% (467 deaths) compared with 33.9% (537 deaths) without IMNI (adjusted HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.00;   = .05]). The distribution of other deaths was similar across groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients with node-positive early breast cancer treated with IMNI or without IMNI depending on breast cancer laterality, IMNI reduced the risk of distant recurrence and death from breast cancer, thereby improving long-term survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The current paper reviews the literature regarding psychosocial issues confronting young women with breast cancer. The findings indicate that younger women with breast cancer experience a lower quality of life after cancer compared to older women. In part, this lower quality of life results from the effects of medical treatment. The effects of surgery and removal of the breast result in more negative feelings regarding body image, particularly for young women. With systemic treatment, many younger women experience the sudden onset of menopause, with the attendant symptoms of hot flashes, decreased sexual desire, and vaginal dryness. These physical effects along with a variety of relationship issues contribute to a high level of sexual concerns for young women. From a psychosocial perspective, breast cancer affects both females and their male partners. Both partners experience psychological distress including depression and anxiety. Within the relationship, emotional support from the partner is important in women's adjustment. In terms of psychosocial interventions for breast cancer, findings suggest that the most frequently employed interventions, which treat the woman without her partner, are not optimal. Initial findings provide encouraging evidence that couple-based psychosocial interventions for women and their partners might be of particular assistance to both partners.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab resulted in a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 50% in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer whose disease progressed during prior trastuzumab-based therapy. To define whether this previously observed encouraging activity was a result of the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab or of pertuzumab alone, we recruited a third cohort of patients who received pertuzumab without trastuzumab. We then investigated the impact of reintroducing trastuzumab to patients whose disease progressed on pertuzumab monotherapy.",
        "Methods": "Twenty-nine patients with HER2-positive breast cancer whose disease progressed during prior trastuzumab-based therapy received pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks) until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Seventeen patients with disease progression continued to receive pertuzumab (at the same dose), with the addition of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose and then 2 mg/kg weekly or 8 mg/kg loading dose and then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks).",
        "Results/Findings": "All 29 patients enrolled for pertuzumab monotherapy experienced disease progression. The objective response rate (ORR) and CBR were 3.4% and 10.3%, respectively, during pertuzumab monotherapy. With the addition of trastuzumab, the ORR and CBR were 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively. Progression-free survival was longer with combination therapy than pertuzumab monotherapy (17.4 v 7.1 weeks, respectively). Treatment was well tolerated with minimal cardiac dysfunction.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although pertuzumab has some activity in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that progressed during therapy with trastuzumab, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab seems to be more active than monotherapy.",

The purpose of this study was to clarify risk factors of IBTR and the impact of IBTR on development of distant metastases in this ethnic group.",
        "Methods": "Patients (N = 1901)with unilateral breast cancer < or = 3 cm in diameter who underwent BCT at 18 Japanese major breast cancer treatment institutes from 1986 to 1993 were registered in this study. Survival rates, the incidences of IBTR and distant metastases, and annual rates of IBTR and distant metastases after primary operation were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risks of IBTR and distant metastases. A Cox model was also used to estimate the risks of distant metastases after IBTR in the group of IBTR.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up time of 107 months, the 10-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 83.9% and 77.8%, respectively. The 10-year cumulative rates of IBTR were 8.5% in the patients with postoperative irradiation and 17.2% in the patients without irradiation. The 10-year cumulative distant metastasis rate was 10.9%. On multivariate analysis, young age, positive surgical margin, and omission of radiation therapy were significant predictors of IBTR. In addition, IBTR significantly correlated with subsequent distant metastases (hazard ratio, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 2.676-5.771; P < 0.0001). Among patients who developed IBTR, initial lymph node metastases and short interval to IBTR were significant risk factors for subsequent distant metastasis.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Young age, positive surgical margin, and omission of radiation therapy seemed to be important factors in relation to local control. The authors' results also indicated that IBTR is significantly associated with subsequent distant metastasis. Patients with positive nodal status at primary operation or with short interval from primary operation to IBTR are at especially high risk of distant metastasis. It remains unclear, however, whether IBTR is an indicator or a cause of subsequent distant metastases.",

This review will endeavor to address the diagnosis, staging, and subsequent treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy. The limited information available for this group of women on the outcomes of labor, delivery, and neonatal health will also be reviewed. This review will not specifically address pregnancy that occurs after diagnosis and subsequent treatment for breast cancer.

        "Results/Findings": "Among 577 patients, 130 had pretreatment MRIs. MRI use increased from 2004 (referent, 13%) versus 2005 (24%, p=0.014) and 2006 (27%, p=0.002). Patients having MRIs were younger (52.5 versus 59.0 years, p < 0.001), but its use was not associated with preoperative chemotherapy, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, presentation, or tumor features. MRI was associated with a 22.4-day delay in pretreatment evaluation (p=0.011). Breast conserving therapy (BCT) was attempted in 320 of 419 patients with complete surgical data. The odds ratio for mastectomy, controlling for T size and stage, was 1.80 after MRI versus no MRI (p=0.024). Patients having MRIs did not have fewer positive margins at lumpectomy (21.6% MRI versus 13.8% no MRI, p=0.20), or conversions from BCT to mastectomy (9.8% MRI versus 5.9% no MRI, p=0.35).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI use was not confined to any particular patient group. MRI use was not associated with improved margin status or BCT attempts, but was associated with a treatment delay and increased mastectomy rate. Without evidence of improved oncologic outcomes as a result, our study does not support the routine use of MRI to select patients or facilitate the performance of BCT.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The authors describe 11 patients with occult breast carcinoma, who initially presented with axillary nodal metastases of unknown origin. In all 11 cases, physical examination and mammography results were normal. Steroid hormone receptor studies were done on tissue from all 11 axillary masses and 2 masses underwent lactalbumin staining as well. In 8 of the 11 patients these studies were positive, suggesting breast as the primary tumor site. Estrogen (30 to 445 fmol/g) or progesterone (30 to 1059 fmol/g) receptors, or both, were positive in seven cases. Although a breast carcinoma was subsequently found in all 11 patients, receptor studies on the primary tumor could not be done in every instance. The authors concluded that performing steroid hormone receptor assays on axillary metastases from occult tumors not only may provide information regarding the identity of the primary tumor but also may be the sole opportunity to determine its hormone receptor status.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The ATEMPT trial was designed to determine if treatment with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) caused less toxicity than paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (TH) and yielded clinically acceptable invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) among patients with stage I human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC).",
        "Methods": "Patients with stage I centrally confirmed HER2+ BC were randomly assigned 3:1 to T-DM1 or TH and received T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 17 cycles or T 80 mg/m  IV with H once every week × 12 weeks (4 mg/kg load →2 mg/kg), followed by H × 39 weeks (6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks). The co-primary objectives were to compare the incidence of clinically relevant toxicities (CRTs) in patients treated with T-DM1 versus TH and to evaluate iDFS in patients receiving T-DM1.",
        "Results/Findings": "The analysis population includes all 497 patients who initiated protocol therapy (383 T-DM1 and 114 TH). CRTs were experienced by 46% of patients on T-DM1 and 47% of patients on TH (  = .83). The 3-year iDFS for T-DM1 was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.3 to 99.3), which rejected the null hypothesis (  < .0001). Serially collected patient-reported outcomes indicated that patients treated with T-DM1 had less neuropathy and alopecia and better work productivity compared with patients on TH.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with stage I HER2+ BC, one year of adjuvant T-DM1 was associated with excellent 3-year iDFS, but was not associated with fewer CRT compared with TH.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The ATAC trial evaluates in a randomized, double-blind design, Arimidextrade mark (anastrozole) alone or in combination with tamoxifen, relative to tamoxifen alone as 5-year adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Patients included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-protocol had been in ATAC for > or =3 months, taking their medication in the morning and were 100% compliant for the preceding 14 days. Blood samples were collected 24 +/- 4 h after last dose. Trough (C(min)) plasma concentrations of anastrozole, tamoxifen and desmethyltamoxifen (DMT) were measured by validated methods. The PK results were based on a total of 347 patients (131 anastrozole (1 mg o.d.), 111 tamoxifen (20 mg o.d.), 105 anastrozole and tamoxifen (1 and 20 mg o.d. respectively)). The geometric mean steady-state trough plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and DMT were statistically equivalent in patients receiving tamoxifen alone or in combination with anastrozole: geometric mean tamoxifen = 94.8 ng ml(-1)and 95.3 ng ml(-1)in tamoxifen alone and combination groups, respectively; geometric mean DMT = 265.1 and 277.6 ng ml(-1)in the tamoxifen and anastrozole and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The geometric mean anastrozole levels were 27% lower (90% Cl 20-33%;P< 0.001) in the presence of tamoxifen than with anastrozole alone. Baseline plasma oestradiol levels were not obtained in the PK sub-protocol, however, such information was available from a similar ATAC sub-protocol, which evaluated bone mineral density. Mean oestradiol levels were 21.3, 19.3, and 21.6 pmol l(-1)prior to treatment and 3.7, 20.9 and 3.6 pmol l(-1)after 3 months in the anastrozole, tamoxifen, and combination groups, respectively (n = 167). On-treatment values were below the detection limit (3 pmol l(-1)) in 43.6 and 38.5% of the anastrozole alone and anastrozole in combination with tamoxifen groups, respectively. As a result of (a) the lack of effect of anastrozole on tamoxifen and DMT levels and (b) the observed fall in blood anastrozole levels having no significant effect on oestradiol suppression by anastrozole, we conclude that the observed reduction in anastrozole levels by tamoxifen is unlikely to be of clinical significance when anastrozole and tamoxifen are administered together.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole inhibits estrogen synthesis. Fulvestrant binds and accelerates degradation of estrogen receptors. We hypothesized that these two agents in combination might be more effective than anastrozole alone in patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women with previously untreated metastatic disease were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 1 mg of anastrozole orally every day (group 1), with crossover to fulvestrant alone strongly encouraged if the disease progressed, or anastrozole and fulvestrant in combination (group 2). Patients were stratified according to prior or no prior receipt of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Fulvestrant was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly thereafter. The primary end point was progression-free survival, with overall survival designated as a prespecified secondary outcome.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median progression-free survival was 13.5 months in group 1 and 15.0 months in group 2 (hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.94; P=0.007 by the log-rank test). The combination therapy was generally more effective than anastrozole alone in all subgroups, with no significant interactions. Overall survival was also longer with combination therapy (median, 41.3 months in group 1 and 47.7 months in group 2; hazard ratio for death, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00; P=0.05 by the log-rank test), despite the fact that 41% of the patients in group 1 crossed over to fulvestrant after progression. Three deaths that were possibly associated with treatment occurred in group 2. The rates of grade 3 to 5 toxic effects did not differ significantly between the two groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The combination of anastrozole and fulvestrant was superior to anastrozole alone or sequential anastrozole and fulvestrant for the treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast cancer, despite the use of a dose of fulvestrant that was below the current standard.

        "Background/Purpose": "The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial (median follow-up, 68 months) has shown that adjuvant anastrozole has superior efficacy and better tolerability than tamoxifen. However, anastrozole reduces circulating estrogen, and low estradiol levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. It is therefore important to understand the effects of long-term aromatase inhibitor therapy on BMD.",
        "Methods": "This prospective substudy of the ATAC trial assessed BMD changes in postmenopausal women with invasive primary breast cancer receiving anastrozole (1 mg/d) or tamoxifen (20 mg/d) as adjuvant therapy for 5 years. Lumbar spine and total hip BMD were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, and 5 years.",
        "Results/Findings": "One hundred ninety-seven women from the monotherapy arms of the ATAC trial were recruited onto the bone substudy, and 108 were included in the primary analysis. Among anastrozole-treated patients, there was a decrease in median BMD from baseline to 5 years in lumbar spine (-6.08%) and total hip (-7.24%) compared with the tamoxifen group (lumbar spine, +2.77%; total hip, +0.74%). No patients with normal BMD at baseline became osteoporotic at 5 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole is associated with accelerated bone loss over the 5-year treatment period. However, although patients with pre-existing osteopenia are likely to require monitoring and bone-protection strategies, patients with normal BMD would not appear to require monitoring beyond the recommendation for healthy postmenopausal women. The effect of anastrozole on bone should be weighed against its superior efficacy and better tolerability profile versus tamoxifen in the main ATAC trial.",

Clip placement in the biopsy-proven node at diagnosis and evaluation of resected specimens for the clipped node should be considered when conducting SLN surgery in this setting.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z0011 was a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial comparing overall survival between patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) who did and did not undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The current study compares complications associated with SLN dissection (SLND) plus ALND, versus SLND alone.",
        "Methods": "From May 1999 to December 2004, 891 patients were randomly assigned to SLND + ALND (n = 445) or SLND alone (n = 446). Information on wound infection, axillary seroma, paresthesia, brachial plexus injury (BPI), and lymphedema was available for 821 patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "Adverse surgical effects were reported in 70% (278 of 399) of patients after SLND + ALND and 25% (103 of 411) after SLND alone (P <or= .001). Patients in the SLND + ALND group had more wound infections (P <or= .0016), seromas (P <or= .0001), and paresthesias (P <or= .0001) than those in the SLND-alone group. At 1 year, lymphedema was reported subjectively by 13% (37 of 288) of patients after SLND + ALND and 2% (six of 268) after SLND alone (P <or= .0001). The difference between the two groups' lymphedema, assessed by arm measurements at 30 days (P = .36), 6 months (P = .22), and 1 year (P = .078), although close to the cutoff for significance at 1 year, was not significant. BPIs occurred in less than 1% of patients.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In trial Z0011, the use of SLND + ALND resulted in more wound infections, axillary seromas, and paresthesias than SLND alone. Lymphedema was more common after SLND + ALND but was significantly different only by subjective report. The use of SLND alone resulted in fewer complications.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the prognosis after treatment for loco-regional recurrences (LR) after (modified) radical mastectomy (MRM) or breast conserving therapy (BCT), in terms of overall survival and time to subsequent LR, in patients originally treated in two European randomised trials. In EORTC trial 10801 and DBCG trial 82-TM, 1,807 patients with stage I and II breast cancer were randomised to receive MRM or BCT from 1980 to 1989. All patients with a LR in these trials were analysed for survival and time to subsequent LR after salvage treatment. Of these, 133 patients had their LR as a first event, the majority within 5 years after initial treatment. The prognostic significance for survival and time to subsequent LR after salvage treatment was analysed in uni-, and multivariate analyses for a number of original tumour- and recurrence-related variables. After salvage treatment of LR after MRM or BCT, actuarial survival curves and the actuarial locoregional control curves were similar. The 5-year survival rates were 58% and 59% and the 5-year subsequent loco-regional control rates 62% and 63%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, pN category (P = 0.03), pT category (P = 0.01) and vascular invasion (P = 0.02) of the primary tumour were the only independent prognostic factors for survival, whereas extensive LR (P < 0.001), interval < or = 2 years (P < 0.002) and pN+ at primary treatment (P = 0.004) were significant predictive factors for time to subsequent LR. The type of original treatment (MRM or BCT) did not have any prognostic impact. It is concluded that the survival and time to subsequent LR after treatment for an early loco-regional recurrence after MRM or BCT was similar in these two European randomised trials. This suggests that both after MRM and BCT an early LR is an indicator of a biologically aggressive tumour; early loco-regional relapse carries a poor prognosis and salvage treatment only cures a limited number of patients, whether treated by MRM or BCT originally.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aim of this meta analysis was to evaluate the benefit of adding concomitant trastuzumab to neoadjuvant(anthracycline and taxane-based) chemotherapy, which was assessed based on two published randomized controlled trials. The eligible patients were randomized to receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent administration of trastuzumab. Relative risks(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals of pathologically complete response in breast and nodes, relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cardiotoxicity were calculated.The RR of obtaining a pathologically complete response in breast and nodes was 2.07 in the experimental arms(1.41–3.03; P = 0.0002; P for heterogeneity 0.63; fixed effect model). The RR of being disease free was 0.67 in favor of the experimental arms (0.48–0.94; P = 0.02; P for heterogeneity 0.22; fixed affect model). The RR of being alive was 0.67 in favor of the experimental arms (0.39–1.15;P= 0.15). The RR of a cardiac event was 1.09 in the arms treated with chemotherapy and concomitant trastuzumab, but that is not significant (0.6–1.98; P =0.77). The addition of concomitant trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy doubles the risk of obtaining a pathologically complete response in both breast and nodes compared with controls. Trastuzumab significantly reduces the risk of relapse and does not increase the risk of cardiotoxicity,despite being associated with anthracyclines. The largest benefit was observed in a locally advanced patient study.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and outcomes in breast cancer patients with tamoxifen treatment. We evaluated the CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms in 766 breast cancer patients. Among them, 110 patients whose samples were prospectively collected before surgery and treated with tamoxifen were included to evaluate the association between CYP2D6 and outcomes. The genotypes of CYP2D6 were categorized as extensive metabolizer (EM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM) according to the activity score. The clinicopathologic features of 110 patients were not significantly different among the three groups except for the T-stage and nodal status. The high T-stage and axillary metastasis were more frequent in the PM group. While recurrence-free and overall survival in the PM group was poorer than the other groups, there was no significant difference between the EM and the IM group. The difference between the PM and the other groups on univariate analysis disappeared on multivariate analysis. These conflicting results suggest that the clinical value of CYP2D6 polymorphisms is still unclear and more large-sized and comprehensively designed trials are necessary.",

This study sought to establish rates of documentation of discussion of risk of infertility, fertility preservation (FP) options, and referrals to fertility specialists in AYA patients' medical records at four cancer centers.",
        "Methods": "All centers reviewed randomized records within the top four AYA disease sites (breast, leukemia/lymphoma, sarcoma, and testicular). Eligible records included those of patients: diagnosed in 2011, with no prior receipt of gonadotoxic therapy; age 18 to 45 years; with no multiple primary cancers; and for whom record was not second opinion. Quality Oncology Practice Initiative methods were used to evaluate documentation of discussion of risk of infertility, discussion of FP options, and referral to a fertility specialist.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 231 records, 26% documented infertility risk discussion, 24% documented FP option discussion, and 13% documented referral to a fertility specialist. Records were less likely to contain evidence of infertility risk and FP option discussions for female patients (P = .030 and .004, respectively) and those with breast cancer (P = .021 and < .001, respectively). Records for Hispanic/Latino patients were less likely to contain evidence of infertility risk discussion (P = .037). Records were less likely to document infertility risk discussion, FP option discussion, and fertility specialist referral for patients age ≥ 40 years (P < .001, < .001, and .002, respectively) and those who already had children (all P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The overall rate of documentation of discussion of FP is low, and results show disparities among specific groups. Although greater numbers of discussions may be occurring, there is a need to create interventions to improve documentation.",

The primary results regarding event-free survival in this trial have not been reported.",
        "Methods": "We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, patients with previously untreated stage II or III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo plus doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo (placebo-chemotherapy group) every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were pathological complete response (the results for which have been reported previously) and event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, occurrence of a second primary cancer, or death from any cause. Safety was also assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 1174 patients who underwent randomization, 784 were assigned to the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 390 to the placebo-chemotherapy group. The median follow-up at this fourth planned interim analysis (data cutoff, March 23, 2021) was 39.1 months. The estimated event-free survival at 36 months was 84.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.7 to 86.9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group, as compared with 76.8% (95% CI, 72.2 to 80.7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.82; P<0.001). Adverse events occurred predominantly during the neoadjuvant phase and were consistent with the established safety profiles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "The study enrolled 622 women with clinical stage 2 or 3 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC. Cohort A comprised 377 patients, and cohort B had 245 patients. The analysis cohort consisted of 509 patients after exclusion of patients who did not meet the trial eligibility criteria, switched to NCT or surgery due to 4-week Ki67 greater than 10%, or withdrew before surgery. Distribution of time to local-regional recurrence (LRR) was estimated using the competing-risk approach, in which distant recurrence and second primaries were considered to be competing-risk events. Patients who died without LRR, distant recurrence, or a second primary were censored at the last evaluation.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 509 patients, 342 (67.2%) had breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Of 221 patients thought to require mastectomy at presentation, 50% were able to have BCS. Five (1%) patients had no residual disease in the breast or nodes at surgery. Among 382 women alive at this writing, 90% have been followed longer than 5 years. The 5-year cumulative incidence rate for LRR is estimated to be 1.53% (95% confidence interval 0.7-3.0%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Rarely does NAI result in pCR for patients with stage 2 or 3 ER+ BC. However, a significant proportion will have downstaged to allow for BCS. Local-regional recurrence after surgery is uncommon (1.5% at 5 years), supporting the use of BCS after NAI.",

Optional tumour banking yielded specimens for determination of recurrence score by RT-PCR. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed the effect of recurrence score on disease-free survival by treatment group (tamoxifen vs CAF-T) using Cox regression, adjusting for number of positive nodes.",

The recurrence score was prognostic in the tamoxifen-alone group (p=0.006; hazard ratio [HR] 2.64, 95% CI 1.33-5.27, for a 50-point difference in recurrence score). There was no benefit of CAF in patients with a low recurrence score (score <18; log-rank p=0.97; HR 1.02, 0.54-1.93), but an improvement in disease-free survival for those with a high recurrence score (score > or =31; log-rank p=0.033; HR 0.59, 0.35-1.01), after adjustment for number of positive nodes. The recurrence score by treatment interaction was significant in the first 5 years (p=0.029), with no additional prediction beyond 5 years (p=0.58), although the cumulative benefit remained at 10 years.

Patients with low-RS (< 18) tumors derived minimal, if any, benefit from chemotherapy treatment (relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.46 to 3.78; absolute decrease in distant recurrence rate at 10 years: mean, -1.1%; SE, 2.2%). Patients with intermediate-RS tumors did not appear to have a large benefit, but the uncertainty in the estimate can not exclude a clinically important benefit.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The RS assay not only quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, but also predicts the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) assay is a validated prognostic/predictive tool in early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (BC); however, only a few prospective outcome results have been available so far. In the phase III PlanB trial, RS was prospectively used to define a subset of patients who received only endocrine therapy. We present 3-year outcome data and concordance analysis (among biomarkers/RS).",
        "Methods": "Central tumor bank was established prospectively from PlanB (intermediate and high-risk, locally human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BC). After an early amendment, HR-positive, pN0-1 patients with RS ≤ 11 were recommended to omit chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "From 2009 to 2011, PlanB enrolled 3,198 patients with a median age of 56 years; 41.1% had node-positive and 32.5% grade 3 disease. In 348 patients (15.3%), chemotherapy was omitted based on RS ≤ 11. After 35 months median follow-up, 3-year disease-free survival in patients with RS ≤ 11 and endocrine therapy alone was 98% versus 92% and 98% in RS > 25 and RS 12 to 25 in chemotherapy-treated patients, respectively. Nodal status, central and local grade, the Ki-67 protein encoded by the MKI67 gene, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, tumor size, and RS were univariate prognostic factors for disease-free survival; only nodal status, both central and local grade, and RS were independent multivariate factors. Histologic grade was discordant between central and local laboratories in 44%. RS was positively but moderately correlated with the Ki-67 protein encoded by the MKI67 gene and grade and negatively correlated with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this prospective trial, patients with enhanced clinical risk and omitted chemotherapy on the basis of RS ≤ 11 had excellent 3-year survival. The substantial discordance observed between traditional prognostic markers and RS emphasizes the need for standardized assessment and supports the potential integration of standardized, well-validated genomic assays such as RS with clinicopathologic prognostic factors for chemotherapy indication in early hormone receptor-positive BC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "The 21-gene OncotypeDX recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies the risk of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. We investigated the association between RS and risk for locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer from two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials (NSABP B-14 and B-20).",
        "Methods": "RS was available for 895 tamoxifen-treated patients (from both trials), 355 placebo-treated patients (from B-14), and 424 chemotherapy plus tamoxifen-treated patients (from B-20). The primary end point was time to first LRR. Distant metastases, second primary cancers, and deaths before LRR were censored.",
        "Results/Findings": "In tamoxifen-treated patients, LRR was significantly associated with RS risk groups (P < .001). The 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of LRR was 4.% (95% CI, 2.3% to 6.3%) for patients with a low RS (< 18), 7.2% (95% CI, 3.4% to 11.0%) for those with intermediate RS (18-30), and 15.8% (95% CI, 10.4% to 21.2%) for those with a high RS (> 30). There were also significant associations between RS and LRR in placebo-treated patients from B-14 (P = .022) and in chemotherapy plus tamoxifen-treated patients from B-20 (P = .028). In multivariate analysis, RS was an independent significant predictor of LRR along with age and type of initial treatment.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Similar to the association between RS and risk for distant recurrence, a significant association exists between RS and risk for LRR.

        "Background/Purpose": "Taxanes have been extensively tested in patients with advanced breast cancer, but it is unclear whether their weekly use might offer any benefits against standard every three weeks administration. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared weekly and every three weeks taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "The endpoints that we assessed were objective response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Efficacy data for paclitaxel and docetaxel were separately analyzed. Trials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library searches and abstracts of major international conferences.",
        "Results/Findings": "Omicronbjective response rate was notably better when paclitaxel was used as every three weeks regimen (7 studies, 1772 patients, fixed effect model pooled RR 1.20 95%CI 1.08-1.32 p<0.001). No difference were found for PFS (6 studies, 1610 patients, random effect model HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.81-1.30 p=0.860); while OS was statistically higher among patients receiving weekly paclitaxel (5 studies, 1471 patients, fixed effect model pooled HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67-0.89 p=0.001). No differences were observed for the weekly compared to the every three weeks use of docetaxel either for objective response, PFS and OS. Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events, neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and peripheral neuropathy were significantly lower in weekly taxanes schedules. The incidence of nail changes and epiphora were significantly lower in the every three weeks docetaxel regimens.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Use of paclitaxel in weekly regimen give overall survival advantages compared with the standard every three weeks regimen. The observed survival benefit does not seem to stem from an increased potency of the drug with weekly regimens. The use of weekly paclitaxel regimens is therefore recommended for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tamoxifen reduces recurrence risk among women treated for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Its effectiveness partly depends on metabolic activation via cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Some medications compromise CYP2D6 activity and may lower plasma concentrations of active tamoxifen metabolites. We studied the association between concurrent use of tamoxifen and CYP2D6-inhibiting medications and breast cancer recurrence among Danish women diagnosed with early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Using the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Registry, we identified 366 cases with local or distant breast cancer recurrence and 366 matched breast cancer controls. We ascertained concurrent prescription of CYP2D6-inhibiting medications during tamoxifen treatment by linking to the national prescription database covering all Danish pharmacies. We computed the breast cancer recurrence odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for each medication. The pooled recurrence OR was null (OR, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.3); recurrence ORs for individual drugs ranged from 0.3 to 3.4. The individual ORs followed the pattern expected under a null-centered Gaussian distribution. Null associations were apparent for all drugs after empirical Bayes adjustment for multiple comparisons. Together, these results provide evidence for a null association between drug-compromised CYP2D6 activity and breast cancer recurrence among tamoxifen-treated women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tamoxifen is standard adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. We assessed the benefit of adding chemotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen and whether tamoxifen should be given concurrently or after chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "We undertook a phase 3, parallel, randomised trial (SWOG-8814, INT-0100) in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer to test two major objectives: whether the primary outcome, disease-free survival, was longer with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) given every 4 weeks for six cycles plus 5 years of daily tamoxifen than with tamoxifen alone; and whether disease-free survival was longer with CAF followed by tamoxifen (CAF-T) than with CAF plus concurrent tamoxifen (CAFT). Overall survival and toxicity were predefined, important secondary outcomes for each objective. Patients in this open-label trial were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm in a 2:3:3 ratio (tamoxifen:CAF-T:CAFT) and analysis was by intention to treat of eligible patients. Groups were compared by stratified log-rank tests, followed by Cox regression analyses adjusted for significant prognostic factors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1558 randomised women, 1477 (95%) were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. After a maximum of 13 years of follow-up (median 8.94 years), 637 women had a disease-free survival event (tamoxifen, 179 events in 361 patients; CAF-T, 216 events in 566 patients; CAFT, 242 events in 550 patients). For the first objective, therapy with the CAF plus tamoxifen groups combined (CAFT or CAF-T) was superior to tamoxifen alone for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (adjusted Cox regression hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.91; p=0.002) but only marginally for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (HR 0.83, 0.68-1.01; p=0.057). For the second objective, the adjusted HRs favoured CAF-T over CAFT but did not reach significance for disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 0.70-1.01; p=0.061) or overall survival (HR 0.90, 0.73-1.10; p=0.30). Neutropenia, stomatitis, thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and leukaemia were more frequent in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Chemotherapy with CAF plus tamoxifen given sequentially is more effective adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer than is tamoxifen alone. However, it might be possible to identify some subgroups that do not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite positive nodes.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tamoxifen has been the standard adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer for more than 20 years. However, the third-generation aromatase inhibitor anastrozole has proven efficacy and tolerability benefits compared with tamoxifen when used as initial adjuvant therapy. We investigate whether women who have received a period of adjuvant tamoxifen would benefit from being switched to anastrozole.",
        "Methods": "We present a combined analysis of data from two prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label trials with nearly identical inclusion criteria. Postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer who had completed 2 years' adjuvant oral tamoxifen (20 or 30 mg daily) were randomised to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole (n=1618) or 20 or 30 mg tamoxifen (n=1606) daily for the remainder of their adjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, with an event defined as local or distant metastasis, or contralateral breast cancer. Analysis was by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "3224 patients were included in analyses. At a median follow-up of 28 months, we noted a 40% decrease in the risk for an event in the anastrozole group as compared with the tamoxifen group (67 events with anastrozole vs 110 with tamoxifen, hazard ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.81, p=0.0009). Both study treatments were well tolerated. There were significantly more fractures (p=0.015) and significantly fewer thromboses (p=0.034) in patients treated with anastrozole than in those on tamoxifen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tamoxifen administered for 5 years at 20 mg/d is effective in breast cancer treatment and prevention, but toxicity has limited its broad use. Biomarker trials showed that 5 mg/d is not inferior to 20 mg/d in decreasing breast cancer proliferation. We hypothesized that a lower dose given for a shorter period could be as effective in preventing recurrence from breast intraepithelial neoplasia but have a lower toxicity than the standard dose.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a multicenter randomized trial of tamoxifen, 5 mg/d or placebo administered for 3 years after surgery in women with hormone-sensitive or unknown breast intraepithelial neoplasia, including atypical ductal hyperplasia and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ. The primary end point was the incidence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.",
        "Results/Findings": "Five hundred women 75 years of age or younger were included. After a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 3.9-6.3 years), there were 14 neoplastic events with tamoxifen and 28 with placebo (11.6   23.9 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.92;   = .02), which resulted in a 5-year number needed to treat of 22 (95% CI, 20 to 27). Tamoxifen decreased contralateral breast events by 75% (three   12 events; hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88;   = .02). Patient-reported outcomes were not different between arms except for a slight increase in frequency of daily hot flashes with tamoxifen (  = .02). There were 12 serious adverse events with tamoxifen and 16 with placebo, including one deep vein thrombosis and one stage I endometrial cancer with tamoxifen and one pulmonary embolism with placebo.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tamoxifen at 5 mg/d for 3 years can halve the recurrence of breast intraepithelial neoplasia with a limited toxicity, which provides a new treatment option in these disorders.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is thought to exert a cytostatic effect on hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells. Some preclinical studies show reduced radiosensitivity in irradiated malignant mammary epithelial cells when pretreated with TAM; other studies refute these results. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest an antagonistic effect of TAM on cytotoxic therapy, with improved disease-free survival (DFS) with sequential versus concurrent TAM. An exploratory analysis was undertaken to evaluate the optimal sequencing of TAM and radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery.",
        "Methods": "Southwest Oncology Group trial 8897 (Intergroup 0102) randomly assigned node-negative women with T1-3 breast cancers to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil (CAF); CAF --> TAM; cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF); and CMF --> TAM. For this analysis, data are reported only in the TAM groups. RT was allowed either before adjuvant therapy (sequential [SEQ] RT; 107 patients) or after chemotherapy but concurrent with TAM (concurrent [CONC] RT; 202 patients). Survival data were adjusted for receptor status, age, and tumor size.",
        "Results/Findings": "With a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 10-year DFS values were 83% and 83% for CONC versus SEQ RT groups (log-rank P = .73; P = .76 adjusted for patient characteristics), and 10-year overall survivals were 88% and 90%, respectively (log-rank P = .59; adjusted P = .65). Patterns of failure showed no increase in in-breast recurrence rates between CONC RT and SEQ RT groups, with 10-year local recurrence rates of 7% for CONC RT and 5% for SEQ RT (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.26 to 2.04; P = .54).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The current analysis does not suggest an adverse effect on local or systemic control with CONC versus SEQ TAM and RT in node-negative breast cancer. A randomized trial is encouraged to validate these results.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Survival rates for people treated for breast or prostate cancer have increased steadily since 2000, which has been attributed to advances in early detection and improvements in treatments. However, breast and prostate cancer therapies that target estrogen and testosterone production are associated with hormone-deprivation symptoms--most commonly hot flashes--that may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Compared to the healthy population, hot flashes occur most often in these two groups, so the authors conducted a literature search specifically for evidence-based interventions to manage hot flashes experienced by women treated for breast cancer and men treated for prostate cancer. The interventions reviewed were divided into two broad categories--pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions--and categorized according to Oncology Nursing Society weights of evidence. Most of the interventions were rated effectiveness not established or lower; however, two drugs, venlafaxine and gabapentin, were rated likely to be effective. In addition, the placebo effect was noted to produce a high percentage of positive results in mitigating hot flashes.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Surgical treatment of breast cancer has evolved from radical mastectomy with routine removal of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) to breast conservative therapy with preservation of the breast and NAC. When breast conservation is not appropriate or the patient desires mastectomy for risk reduction, conventional therapy still consists of mastectomy with removal of the NAC, followed by reconstruction. Rising interest in improved cosmesis has led to the introduction of the skin-sparing and nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) as potential alternatives to mastectomy. There has been much controversy regarding the oncologic safety of these procedures, and the NSM has also introduced a set of complications, such as nipple and areolar necrosis, that are not a concern with total mastectomy. From our review of the literature, we feel that NSM may be a viable option in the appropriate setting, and that its risks and complications are acceptable when compared to the traditional surgical treatment of breast cancer.",

        "Results/Findings": "Women who had complete excision of the primary breast tumor with negative surgical margins had a 40% reduced risk of death as a result of breast cancer (multiadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.0) compared with women who did not have surgery (P = .049). This mortality reduction was not significantly different among patients with different sites of metastasis, but in the stratified analysis the effect was particularly evident for women with bone metastasis only (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P = .001).

        "Background/Purpose": "Success achieved with skin-sparing mastectomy has led surgeons to reconsider the necessity of nipple-areola complex removal. This study reports our short- and mid-term postoperative outcomes with nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and an updated review of reported literature. Data were retrospectively abstracted from medical records at our institution. Patients underwent NSM based on patient preference, oncologic criteria, and cosmesis. A literature review was undertaken through a PUBMED search and selected based on title and abstract relevance. Twenty-five patients underwent 42 NSMs at our institution from July 2000 to October 2005. Patient mean age was 44 years (29-59 years). Indications for mastectomy were: 34 (81%) for prophylaxis, 5 (12%) for invasive ductal carcinoma, 2 (5%) for ductal carcinoma in situ, and 1 (2%) for a malignant phyllodes tumor. One prophylactic mastectomy specimen showed ductal carcinoma in situ in the retroareolar tissue, and the nipple-areola complex was removed at a second operation. Mean tumor size in cases with invasive carcinoma (n = 5) was 1.9 cm (0.7-2.5 cm). All tumors were peripherally located, and no cases showed occult nipple involvement. The nipple-areola complex was entirely preserved in 39 (93%) mastectomies. One nipple-areola complex was surgically removed, and two (5%) cases had partial loss due to infection or ischemia. Cosmetic result from surgeon's assessment was excellent in 30 mastectomies, good in 7, acceptable in 3, and poor in 2, with slight nipple asymmetry in 8 cases. At a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range, 0.4-56.4 months), the 39 nipple-areola complexes were intact and there were no local or systemic recurrences in cases treated for cancer. NSM represented approximately 1% of all mastectomies performed at our institution during the reported period. It was mostly used for prophylaxis and for the treatment of malignant tumors in few selected cases. NSM can be performed with a high success rate of nipple-areola complex preservation. Conclusions about the oncologic safety of this procedure cannot be drawn from our study due to small size series and short follow-up. However, available published data show that NSM can be safely performed for breast cancer treatment in carefully selected cases. Further studies and longer follow-up are necessary to refine selection criteria for NSM.",

        "Results/Findings": "Of 417 eligible patients, 107 were randomly assigned to group A, 107 to group B, 107 to group C, and 96 to group D. Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a significantly improved pathological complete response rate (49 of 107 patients; 45·8% [95% CI 36·1-55·7]) compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group A; 31 of 107; 29·0% [20·6-38·5]; p=0·0141). 23 of 96 (24·0% [15·8-33·7]) women given pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D) had a pathological complete response, as did 18 of 107 (16·8% [10·3-25·3]) given pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (61 of 107 women in group A, 48 of 107 in group B, one of 108 in group C, and 52 of 94 in group D), febrile neutropenia (eight, nine, none, and seven, respectively), and leucopenia (13, five, none, and seven, respectively). The number of serious adverse events was similar in groups A, B, and D (15-20 serious adverse events per group in 10-17% of patients) but lower in group C (four serious adverse events in 4% of patients).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a significantly improved pathological complete response rate compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel, without substantial differences in tolerability. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy eradicated tumours in a proportion of women and showed a favourable safety profile. These findings justify further exploration in adjuvant trials and support the neoadjuvant approach for accelerating drug assessment in early breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study, treatment-naive women with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally and stratified by operable, locally advanced, and inflammatory breast cancer, and by hormone receptor expression to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of: trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2), escalating, if tolerated, to 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks; group A) or pertuzumab (loading dose 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) or pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C) or pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D). The primary endpoint, examined in the intention-to-treat population, was pathological complete response in the breast. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 417 eligible patients, 107 were randomly assigned to group A, 107 to group B, 107 to group C, and 96 to group D. Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a significantly improved pathological complete response rate (49 of 107 patients; 45·8% [95% CI 36·1-55·7]) compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group A; 31 of 107; 29·0% [20·6-38·5]; p=0·0141). 23 of 96 (24·0% [15·8-33·7]) women given pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D) had a pathological complete response, as did 18 of 107 (16·8% [10·3-25·3]) given pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (61 of 107 women in group A, 48 of 107 in group B, one of 108 in group C, and 52 of 94 in group D), febrile neutropenia (eight, nine, none, and seven, respectively), and leucopenia (13, five, none, and seven, respectively). The number of serious adverse events was similar in groups A, B, and D (15-20 serious adverse events per group in 10-17% of patients) but lower in group C (four serious adverse events in 4% of patients).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a significantly improved pathological complete response rate compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel, without substantial differences in tolerability. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy eradicated tumours in a proportion of women and showed a favourable safety profile. These findings justify further exploration in adjuvant trials and support the neoadjuvant approach for accelerating drug assessment in early breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Studies have failed to identify characteristics of women who have been diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and have a high or low risk of subsequent invasive cancer.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a nested case-control study in a population-based cohort of 1162 women who were diagnosed with DCIS and treated by lumpectomy alone from 1983 to 1994. We collected clinical characteristics and information on subsequent tumors, defined as invasive breast cancer or DCIS diagnosed in the ipsilateral breast containing the initial DCIS lesion or at a regional or distant site greater than 6 months after initial treatment of DCIS (N = 324). We also conducted standardized pathology reviews and immunohistochemical staining for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, Ki67 antigen, p53, p16, epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ERBB2, HER2/neu oncoprotein), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) on the initial paraffin-embedded DCIS tissue. Competing risk models were used to determine factors associated with risk of subsequent invasive cancer vs DCIS, and cumulative incidence survival functions were used to estimate 8-year risk.",
        "Results/Findings": "Factors associated with subsequent invasive cancer differed from those associated with subsequent DCIS. Eight-year risk of subsequent invasive cancer was statistically significantly (P = .018) higher for women with initial DCIS lesions that were detected by palpation or that were p16, COX-2, and Ki67 triple positive (p16(+)COX-2(+)Ki67(+)) (19.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.0% to 21.3%) than for women with initial lesions that were detected by mammography and were p16, COX-2, and Ki67 triple negative (p16(-)COX-2(-)Ki67(-)) (4.1%, 95% CI = 3.4% to 5.0%). In a multivariable model, DCIS lesions that were p16(+)COX-2(+)Ki67(+) or those detected by palpation were statistically significantly associated with subsequent invasive cancer, but nuclear grade was not. Eight-year risk of subsequent DCIS was highest for women with DCIS lesions that had disease-free margins of 1 mm or greater combined with either ER(-)ERBB2(+)Ki67(+) or p16(+)COX-2(-)Ki67(+) status (23.6%, 95% CI = 18.1% to 34.0%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Biomarkers can identify which women who were initially diagnosed with DCIS are at high or low risk of subsequent invasive cancer, whereas histopathology information cannot.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Standard curative schedules of radiotherapy to the breast deliver 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy over 5 weeks. In a randomised trial, we tested whether fewer, larger fractions were at least as safe and as effective as standard regimens. In this analysis, we assessed the long-term results of tumour control in the same population.",
        "Methods": "In 1986-98, we randomly assigned 1410 women with invasive breast cancer (tumour stage 1-3 with a maximum of one positive node and no metastasis) who had had local tumour excision of early stage breast cancer to receive 50 Gy radiotherapy given in 25 fractions, 39 Gy given in 13 fractions, or 42.9 Gy given in 13 fractions, all given over 5 weeks. The primary endpoint was late change in breast appearance, which has been reported elsewhere. Here, we report ipsilateral tumour relapse, one of the secondary endpoints. Relapse was defined as any appearance of cancer in the irradiated breast. Analysis was by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 9.7 years (IQR 7.8-11.8) for the 838 (95%) patients who survived, the risk of ipsilateral tumour relapse after 10 years was 12.1% (95% CI 8.8-15.5) in the 50 Gy group, 14.8% (11.2-18.3) in the 39 Gy group, and 9.6% (6.7-12.6) in the 42.9 Gy group (difference between 39 Gy and 42.9 Gy groups, chi2 test, p=0.027). The sensitivity of breast cancer to dose per fraction was estimated to be 4.0 Gy (95% CI 1.0-7.8), similar to that estimated for the late adverse effects in healthy tissue from breast radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer tissue is probably just as sensitive to fraction size as dose-limiting healthy tissues. If this finding is confirmed, radiotherapy schedules can be greatly simplified by the delivery of fewer, larger fractions without compromising effectiveness or safety, and possibly improving both.",

Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines a humanized monoclonal antibody, which targets the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), with SN-38, which is conjugated to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy enables delivery of high concentrations of SN-38 to tumors.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a phase 1/2 single-group, multicenter trial involving patients with advanced epithelial cancers who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. A total of 108 patients received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight after receiving at least two previous anticancer therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in ≥10% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Staging procedures used to detect metastatic breast cancer at the time of diagnosis are bone scan (BS), chest X-ray (CXR), liver ultrasonography (LUS) and laboratory parameters (LP). These procedures are expensive and not all patients need them. We aimed to identify groups of patients with different risks for metastatic disease.",
        "Methods": "We reviewed data from 1,218 consecutive cases of breast cancer. Pathological and biological parameters and instrumental procedures performed at the time of diagnosis and during 6 months of follow-up were recorded. True positive and negative, false positive and negative cases were evaluated. All cases were grouped on the basis of tumour size, nodal involvement, biological characteristics, menopausal status and age.",
        "Results/Findings": "We observed 46 (3.8%) true positive cases with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Documentation relating to BS, CXR and LUS was available for 1,193, 1,206 and 1,206 patients, respectively, with 37 (3.1%), 8 (0.7%) and 10 (0.8%) true positive tests. Logistic regression analysis showed significant odds ratio estimates for pT status and nodal status, thus highlighting the role of these morphological data. These findings suggest that breast cancer patients can be divided into two subgroups: first group pT1-3N0-1. with < or = 3 involved nodes, and second group pT1-3N1 with > or = 4 involved nodes, pT4 and pN2 (metastases detection rate 1.46 and 10.68%, respectively). In the former group the appropriate procedures of staging would only be laboratory parameters, whereas in the latter group BS, CXR, LUS, LP and tumour markers CEA and CA 15.3 would.be necessary.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The standard staging procedures to detect metastatic disease at breast cancer diagnosis require modification. On the basis of the literature data and our findings, the full staging procedure is appropriate in the second group of patients.",

        "Methods": "Data were collected from young cancer survivors aged over 13 years at diagnosis, attending support group conferences held in 2004 and 2011. Data were collected anonymously using remote handsets in response to questions projected on the screen during plenary sessions.",

In both years, most males reported fertility discussions taking place before treatment started and they were generally satisfied with it. However in both years, fewer females recall a discussion about fertility and they were generally less satisfied. Although in 2011 more females reported a fertility discussion prior to the beginning of treatment, they were no more satisfied than the females in 2004 whose fertility discussion were more likely to take place after treatment had started.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Whilst male cancer survivors in the UK are generally satisfied about the frequency and timing of discussions about fertility, females are not. Although in 2011 fertility discussions with females more often took place before treatment began, they were no more satisfied than females in 2004. This may reflect the approach by professionals or the absence of effective fertility preservation strategies for them.",

        "Methods": "A retrospective review was performed that included 38 consecutive patients with high-risk breast carcinoma who underwent SSM and immediate reconstruction (between July 1996 and January 2002). Tumor characteristics, type of reconstruction, margin status, timing of adjuvant therapy, postoperative complications, and incidence of recurrence were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "High-risk patients (Stage IIA [n=4 patients] Stage IIB [n=23 patients] Stage IIIA [n=8 patients] and Stage IIIB [n=3 patients]) underwent immediate reconstruction after SSM with the use of a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (n=31 patients), a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap plus an implant (n=3 patients), or tissue expanders with subsequent implant placement (n=4 patients). The median follow-up was 52.9 months (range, 27.5-92.0 months), and the median time to recurrence has not yet been reached at the time of last follow-up. The median interval from surgery to the initiation of postoperative adjuvant therapy was 38 days (range, 25-238 days). Local recurrence was seen in 1 patient (2.6%), systemic recurrence in was seen in 10 patients (26.3%), and both local and distant metastases in were seen in 2 other patients (5.3%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SSM with immediate reconstruction appeared to be an oncologically safe treatment option for high-risk patients with advanced stages of breast carcinoma.

        "Results/Findings": "In univariate analysis, reduced mortality was weakly associated with higher vegetable-fruit consumption, increased physical activity, and a body mass index that was neither low weight nor obese. In a multivariate Cox model, only the combination of consuming five or more daily servings of vegetables-fruits, and accumulating 540+ metabolic equivalent tasks-min/wk (equivalent to walking 30 minutes 6 d/wk), was associated with a significant survival advantage (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.98). The approximate 50% reduction in risk associated with these healthy lifestyle behaviors was observed in both obese and nonobese women, although fewer obese women were physically active with a healthy dietary pattern (16% v 30%). Among those who adhered to this healthy lifestyle, there was no apparent effect of obesity on survival. The effect was stronger in women who had hormone receptor-positive cancers.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A minority of breast cancer survivors follow a healthy lifestyle that includes both recommended intakes of vegetables-fruits and moderate levels of physical activity.

We compared progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the 2 cohorts.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 163 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria, 75 received gemcitabine and 88 carboplatin-gemcitabine. Patients in the combination cohort had received a lower number of previous chemotherapy lines (2 vs. 3), and were less likely to have received carboplatin (9 patients [10%] vs. 34 patients [45%]; P < .0001). We found no PFS differences in carboplatin-gemcitabine and gemcitabine cohorts (4.24 vs. 4.61 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; P = .92), whereas the combination was associated with a trend toward higher ORR (18 patients [20.4%] vs. 8 patients [10.6%]; P = .089) and with significantly higher incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia (30 patients [34%] vs. 5 patients [6.6%]; P < .0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Using carboplatin in addition to gemcitabine is associated with more hematologic AEs but not with better PFS. Although single-agent gemcitabine remains a treatment option for heavily pretreated mBC patients, finding biomarkers of response to platinum salts might help to identify patients more likely to benefit from carboplatin-gemcitabine.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Since the introduction of breast-conserving treatment, various radiation doses after lumpectomy have been used. In a phase 3 randomised controlled trial, we investigated the effect of a radiation boost of 16 Gy on overall survival, local control, and fibrosis for patients with stage I and II breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving treatment compared with patients who received no boost. Here, we present the 20-year follow-up results.",
        "Methods": "Patients with microscopically complete excision for invasive disease followed by whole-breast irradiation of 50 Gy in 5 weeks were centrally randomised (1:1) with a minimisation algorithm to receive 16 Gy boost or no boost, with minimisation for age, menopausal status, presence of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, clinical tumour size, nodal status, and institution. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May 24, 1989, and June 25, 1996, 2657 patients were randomly assigned to receive no radiation boost and 2661 patients randomly assigned to receive a radiation boost. Median follow-up was 17.2 years (IQR 13.0-19.0). 20-year overall survival was 59.7% (99% CI 56.3-63.0) in the boost group versus 61.1% (57.6-64.3) in the no boost group, hazard ratio (HR) 1.05 (99% CI 0.92-1.19, p=0.323). Ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was the first treatment failure for 354 patients (13%) in the no boost group versus 237 patients (9%) in the boost group, HR 0.65 (99% CI 0.52-0.81, p<0.0001). The 20-year cumulative incidence of ipsilatelal breast tumour recurrence was 16.4% (99% CI 14.1-18.8) in the no boost group versus 12.0% (9.8-14.4) in the boost group. Mastectomies as first salvage treatment for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence occurred in 279 (79%) of 354 patients in the no boost group versus 178 (75%) of 237 in the boost group. The cumulative incidence of severe fibrosis at 20 years was 1.8% (99% CI 1.1-2.5) in the no boost group versus 5.2% (99% CI 3.9-6.4) in the boost group (p<0.0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A radiation boost after whole-breast irradiation has no effect on long-term overall survival, but can improve local control, with the largest absolute benefit in young patients, although it increases the risk of moderate to severe fibrosis. The extra radiation dose can be avoided in most patients older than age 60 years.",

The objective of this population-based study was to determine whether women with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) who received treatment in a modern era had a poorer survival compared those with non-IBC locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).",
        "Methods": "The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry was searched to identify women with stage IIIB/C breast cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 who had undergone surgery and radiotherapy. Patients were categorized as either having IBC or non-IBC LABC according the sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and compared across groups using the log-rank statistic. Cox models were then fitted to compare the association between breast cancer type and BCS after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 828 (19.2%) women and 3476 (80.8%) women had stage IIIB/C IBC and non-IBC LABC, respectively. The median follow-up was 19 months. The 2-year BCS rate was 90% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 88%-91%) for the entire cohort and 84% (95%CI, 80%-87%) and 91% (95%CI, 90%-91%) among women with IBC and non-IBC LABC, respectively. In the multivariable model, patients with IBC were found to have a 43% increased risk of death from breast cancer compared with patients with non-IBC LABC (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95%CI, 1.10-1.86 [P = .008]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In the era of multidisciplinary management and anthracycline-based and taxane-based polychemotherapy regimens, women with IBC continue to have worse survival outcomes compared with those with non-IBC LABC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Several previous studies have reported conflicting data on recent trends in use of initial total mastectomy (TM); the factors that contribute to TM variation are not entirely clear. Using a multi-institution database, we analyzed how practice, patient, and tumor characteristics contributed to variation in TM for invasive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "We collected detailed clinical and pathologic data about breast cancer diagnosis, initial, and subsequent breast cancer operations performed on all female patients from 4 participating institutions from 2003 to 2008. We limited this analysis to 2,384 incident cases of invasive breast cancer, stages I to III, and excluded patients with clinical indications for mastectomy. Predictors of initial TM were identified with univariate analyses and random effects multivariable logistic regression models.",
        "Results/Findings": "Initial TM was performed on 397 (16.7%) eligible patients. Use of preoperative MRI more than doubled the rate of TM (odds ratio [OR] = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.58-3.77; p < 0.0001). Increasing tumor size, high nuclear grade, and age were also associated with increased rates of initial TM. Differences by age and ethnicity were observed, and significant variation in the frequency of TM was seen at the individual surgeon level (p < 0.001). Our results were similar when restricted to tumors <20 mm.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We identified factors associated with initial TM, including preoperative MRI and individual surgeon, that contribute to the current debate about variation in use of TM for the management of breast cancer. Additional evaluation of patient understanding of surgical options and outcomes in breast cancer and the impact of the surgeon provider is warranted.",

National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-32 is a randomized phase III trial comparing SNR immediately followed by AD (SNAD) to SNR and subsequent AD if SN is positive. We report the definitive patient-reported outcomes (PRO) comparisons.",

They completed questionnaires presurgery, 1 and 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively, and every 6 months through year 3. Arm symptoms, arm use avoidance, activity limitations, and quality of life (QOL) were compared with intent-to-treat two-sample t-tests and repeated measures analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "Arm symptoms were significantly more bothersome for SNAD compared with SNR patients at 6 months (mean, 4.8 v 3.0; P < .001) and at 12 months (3.6 v 2.5; P = .006). Longitudinally, SNAD patients were more likely to experience ipsilateral arm and breast symptoms, restricted work and social activity, and impaired QOL (P < or = .002 all items). From 12 to 36 months, fewer than 15% of either SNAD or SNR patients reported moderate or greater severity of any given symptom or activity limitation.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Arm morbidity was greater with SNAD than with SNR. Despite considerable fears about complications from AD for breast cancer, this study demonstrates that initial problems with either surgery resolve over time.",

However, completion ALND for patients with tumor-involved SNs remains the standard to achieve locoregional control. Few studies have examined the outcome of patients who do not undergo ALND for positive SNs. We now report local and regional recurrence information from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial.",
        "Methods": "American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 was a prospective trial examining survival of patients with SN metastases detected by standard H and E, who were randomized to undergo ALND after SLND versus SLND alone without specific axillary treatment. Locoregional recurrence was evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 446 patients randomized to SLND alone and 445 to SLND + ALND. Patients in the 2 groups were similar with respect to age, Bloom-Richardson score, estrogen receptor status, use of adjuvant systemic therapy, tumor type, T stage, and tumor size. Patients randomized to SLND + ALND had a median of 17 axillary nodes removed compared with a median of only 2 SN removed with SLND alone (P < 0.001). ALND also removed more positive lymph nodes (P < 0.001). At a median follow-up time of 6.3 years, there were no statistically significant differences in local recurrence (P = 0.11) or regional recurrence (P = 0.45) between the 2 groups.",

We conducted a multicenter randomized trial to compare quality-of-life outcomes between patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer who received sentinel lymph node biopsy and patients who received standard axillary treatment.",
        "Methods": "The primary outcome measures were arm and shoulder morbidity and quality of life. From November 1999 to October 2003, 1031 patients were randomly assigned to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (n = 515) or standard axillary surgery (n = 516). Patients with sentinel lymph node metastases proceeded to delayed axillary clearance or received axillary radiotherapy (depending on the protocol at the treating institution). Intention-to-treat analyses of data at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery are presented. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "The relative risks of any lymphedema and sensory loss for the sentinel lymph node biopsy group compared with the standard axillary treatment group at 12 months were 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23 to 0.60; absolute rates: 5% versus 13%) and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.27 to 0.50; absolute rates: 11% versus 31%), respectively. Drain usage, length of hospital stay, and time to resumption of normal day-to-day activities after surgery were statistically significantly lower in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group (all P < .001), and axillary operative time was reduced (P = .055). Overall patient-recorded quality of life and arm functioning scores were statistically significantly better in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group throughout (all P < or = .003). These benefits were seen with no increase in anxiety levels in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group (P > .05).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, a new standard of care for staging invasive breast cancer, remains controversial for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Although DCIS has a natural history in which long-term distant disease-free survival (DDFS) is 98% to 99% and axillary node metastases are historically rare, three recent DCIS series have found SLN metastases in a surprising 6% to 13% of patients. The strongest argument for SLN biopsy in DCIS is the diagnostic uncertainty and inherent sampling error of conventional pathologic techniques. Definitive surgery (excision or mastectomy) reveals invasive cancer in 10% to 21% of patients with a preoperative core needle or surgical biopsy diagnosis of DCIS, all of whom become conventional candidates for SLN biopsy. In the absence of proven invasion, most positive SLN in DCIS are micrometastases detected by hematoxylin and eosin- and immunohistochemical-stained serial sections. An increasing body of evidence suggests that these are prognostically significant, not artifactual. We propose that DCIS patients with positive SLN have occult invasive cancers, and that the same may have been true for the 1% to 2% of DCIS patients who go on to develop distant metastasis, either after an invasive local recurrence or as a first event. We further suggest that the diagnosis of DCIS encompasses two patient populations: 1) a majority (perhaps 90%) with true in situ disease (or prognostically insignificant invasion), negative SLNs, and an expected DDFS of 100%; and 2) a minority (perhaps 10%) with occult invasion, positive SLNs, and an expected DDFS of perhaps 90%. Pending the development of predictive models for preoperative identification of this SLN-positive minority of DCIS patients, SLN biopsy is indicated in any DCIS patient who may have an underlying invasive cancer, especially those who require mastectomy. In DCIS, SLN biopsy may ultimately prove to be a more sensitive screening test for occult invasion than examination of the breast itself.",

The trial is being conducted at 89 sites in 16 countries; the tumour-agnostic population was enrolled at 30 sites (outpatient and inpatient medical facilities) across eight countries. A prespecified interim analysis of LIBRETTO-001 was planned to investigate the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in a tumour-agnostic population of patients with RET fusion-positive advanced solid tumours; the data cutoff date was Sept 24, 2021. Eligible patients had disease progression on or after previous systemic therapies or no satisfactory therapeutic options and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Selpercatinib was orally administered in a continuous 28-day cycle. Patients enrolled in the phase 1 dose-escalation portion received between 20 mg once daily or 20-240 mg twice daily; the phase 2 recommended dose was 160 mg twice daily.

The efficacy-evaluable tumour-agnostic population was defined as patients with RET fusion-positive cancer, other than non-small-cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, who had at least 6 months of follow-up from the first study dose at the time of data cutoff (all responders at the time of data cutoff were followed up for at least 6 months from the onset of response unless they progressed or died earlier). Safety was analysed in the tumour-agnostic population of patients who had been enrolled and received selpercatinib on or before the data cutoff date. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and is still recruiting participants.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 4, 2017, and Aug 4, 2021, 45 patients with RET fusion-positive tumour-agnostic cancers were enrolled from the phase 1 dose-escalation and phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts of the trial. 43 (96%) of 45 patients received a starting dose of selpercatinib at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Of the two patients who did not, one received a dose of 160 mg twice daily via intra-patient dose escalation (as allowed per protocol for patients enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study at lower doses) and the other patient's starting dose of 120 mg twice daily was never escalated. Of the 41 efficacy-evaluable patients, the objective response rate as per the independent review committee was 43·9% (95% CI 28·5-60·3; 18 of 41 patients). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (ten [22%] of 45 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase (seven [16%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [13%]). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred in 18 (40%) of 45 patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Selpercatinib showed clinically meaningful activity in the RET fusion-positive tumour-agnostic population, with a safety profile consistent with that observed in other indications. Comprehensive genomic testing that includes RET fusions will be crucial for identifying patients who might benefit from selpercatinib.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Risk of distant recurrence (DR) among women with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive early breast cancer is the major determinant of recommendations for or against chemotherapy. It is frequently estimated using the Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS). The PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score provides an alternative approach, which also identifies intrinsic subtypes.",
        "Methods": "mRNA from 1,017 patients with ER-positive primary breast cancer treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen in the ATAC trial was assessed for ROR using the NanoString nCounter. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests and concordance indices (c indices) were used to assess the prognostic information provided beyond that of a clinical treatment score (CTS) by RS, ROR, or IHC4, an index of DR risk derived from immunohistochemical assessment of ER, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67.",
        "Results/Findings": "ROR added significant prognostic information beyond CTS in all patients (Δ LR-χ(2) = 33.9; P < .001) and in all four subgroups: node negative, node positive, HER2 negative, and HER2 negative/node negative; more information was added by ROR than by RS. C indices in the HER2-negative/node-negative subgroup were 0.73, 0.76, and 0.78 for CTS, CTS plus RS, and CTS plus ROR, respectively. More patients were scored as high risk and fewer as intermediate risk by ROR than by RS. Relatively similar prognostic information was added by ROR and IHC4 in all patients but more by ROR in the HER2-negative/node-negative group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "ROR provides more prognostic information in endocrine-treated patients with ER-positive, node-negative disease than RS, with better differentiation of intermediate- and higher-risk groups.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Ribociclib has been shown to have a significant overall survival benefit in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Whether this benefit in advanced breast cancer extends to early breast cancer is unclear.",
        "Methods": "In this international, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive ribociclib (at a dose of 400 mg per day for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off, for 3 years) plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI; letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg per day or anastrozole at a dose of 1 mg per day for ≥5 years) or an NSAI alone. Premenopausal women and men also received goserelin every 28 days. Eligible patients had anatomical stage II or III breast cancer. Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of invasive disease-free survival, the primary end point; other efficacy and safety results are also reported. Invasive disease-free survival was evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical comparison was made with the use of a stratified log-rank test, with a protocol-specified stopping boundary of a one-sided P-value threshold of 0.0128 for superior efficacy.",
        "Results/Findings": "As of the data-cutoff date for this prespecified interim analysis (January 11, 2023), a total of 426 patients had had invasive disease, recurrence, or death. A significant invasive disease-free survival benefit was seen with ribociclib plus an NSAI as compared with an NSAI alone. At 3 years, invasive disease-free survival was 90.4% with ribociclib plus an NSAI and 87.1% with an NSAI alone (hazard ratio for invasive disease, recurrence, or death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.91; P = 0.003). Secondary end points - distant disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival - also favored ribociclib plus an NSAI. The 3-year regimen of ribociclib at a 400-mg starting dose plus an NSAI was not associated with any new safety signals.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Ribociclib plus an NSAI significantly improved invasive disease-free survival among patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative stage II or III early breast cancer. (Funded by Novartis; NATALEE ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

Analysis was made on 78 patients with MBC whose ER, PR and/or HER-2 status were known both on the tissue samples of primary and RML. Among the RML sites, 29.5% were locoregional, 70.5% were distant metastatic sites. Among 75 patients with known ER expression on both primary and RML, 36% (n = 27) showed discordance on ER expression. Among 72 patients with known PR expression on both primary and RML, 54.2% (n = 39) showed discordance on PR expression. Among 61 patients with known HER-2 expression on both primary and RML, 14.7% (n = 9) showed discordance on HER-2 expression. No differences were observed when we compared patients who have discordant ER and HER-2 status with patients who have concordant results between the primary tumor and paired RML with respect to site of biopsy (locoregional vs distant metastasis) and prior therapies (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy). As these discordant results make changes in treatment decision, a biopsy of the metastatic lesion could be recommended in patients with MBC when feasible.

Although several reports have retrospectively evaluated outcomes after breast reconstruction for locally advanced disease (stages IIB and III), no study has specifically considered immediate breast reconstruction after SSM for locally advanced disease.",
        "Methods": "From 1996 to 1998, 67 consecutive patients with breast carcinoma underwent SSM with immediate reconstruction and were prospectively observed. From this group of patients, those with locally advanced disease (stage IIB, n = 12; stage III, n = 13) were analyzed separately. Tumor characteristics, adjuvant therapy, type of reconstruction, operative time, complications, hospital stay, and incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis were noted.",
        "Results/Findings": "Breast reconstruction consisted of a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (n = 22) or a latissimus flap plus an implant (n = 4). The median operative time was 5.5 hours; the average hospital stay was 5.2 days. Complications required reoperation in three patients (12%): partial skin flap necrosis in two and partial abdominal skin necrosis in one. Surgery on the opposite breast for symmetry was required in one patient (4%). Postoperative adjuvant therapy was not significantly delayed (median interval, 32 days). With a median length of follow-up of 49.2 months (range, 33-64 months), local recurrence was present in only one patient (4%), with successful local salvage treatment, and distant metastasis was present in four patients (16%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SSM with immediate reconstruction seems safe and effective and has a low morbidity for patients with advanced stages of breast carcinoma.

However, mastectomy rates increased from 2004 to 2006 predominantly among patients without MRI (29% in 2003% to 41% in 2006; P < .0001). In a multivariable model, both MRI (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; P < .0001) and surgical year (compared to 2003 OR: 1.4 for 2004, 1.8 for 2005, and 1.7 for 2006; P < .0001) were independent predictors of mastectomy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After a steady decline, mastectomy rates have increased in recent years with both surgery year and MRI as significant predictors for type of surgery. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of MRI and other factors influencing surgical planning.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have demonstrated equivalent survival for breast-conserving therapy with radiation (BCT) and mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer. A large, population-based series of women who underwent BCT or mastectomy was studied to observe whether outcomes of RCT were achieved in the general population, and whether survival differed by surgery type when stratified by age and hormone receptor (HR) status.",
        "Methods": "Information was obtained regarding all women diagnosed in the state of California with stage I or II breast cancer between 1990 and 2004, who were treated with either BCT or mastectomy and followed for vital status through December 2009. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between BCT and mastectomy groups. Analyses were stratified by age group (< 50 years and ≥ 50 years) and tumor HR status.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 112,154 women fulfilled eligibility criteria. Women undergoing BCT had improved OS and DSS compared with women with mastectomy (adjusted hazard ratio for OS entire cohort = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-0.83). The DSS benefit with BCT compared with mastectomy was greater among women age ≥ 50 with HR-positive disease (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.91) than among women age < 50 with HR-negative disease (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98); however, this trend was seen among all subgroups analyzed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with early stage breast cancer, BCT was associated with improved DSS. These data provide confidence that BCT remains an effective alternative to mastectomy for early stage disease regardless of age or HR status.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Radiotherapy prevents local recurrence of breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery. We evaluated the effect of a supplementary dose of radiation to the tumor bed on the rates of local recurrence among patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for early breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "After lumpectomy and axillary dissection, patients with stage I or II breast cancer received 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast in 2-Gy fractions over a five-week period. Patients with a microscopically complete excision were randomly assigned to receive either no further local treatment (2657 patients) or an additional localized dose of 16 Gy, usually given in eight fractions by means of an external electron beam (2661 patients).",
        "Results/Findings": "During a median follow-up period of 5.1 years, local recurrences were observed in 182 of the 2657 patients in the standard-treatment group and 109 of the 2661 patients in the additional-radiation group. The five-year actuarial rates of local recurrence were 7.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 7.6 percent) and 4.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 4.7 percent), respectively (P<0.001), yielding a hazard ratio for local recurrence of 0.59 (99 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81) associated with an additional dose. Patients 40 years old or younger benefited most; at five years, their rate of local recurrence was 19.5 percent with standard treatment and 10.2 percent with additional radiation (hazard ratio, 0.46 [99 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.89]; P=0.002). At five years in the age group 41 to 50 years old, no differences were found in rates of metastasis or overall survival (which were 87 and 91 percent, respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients with early breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery and receive 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast, an additional dose of 16 Gy of radiation to the tumor bed reduces the risk of local recurrence, especially in patients younger than 50 years of age.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is a standard treatment option for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We sought to determine the survival benefit of RT after BCS on the basis of risk factors for local recurrence.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was performed to identify patients with DCIS diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 and treated with BCS by using SEER data. Patients were divided into the following two groups: BCS+RT (RT group) and BCS alone (non-RT group). We used a patient prognostic scoring model to stratify patients on the basis of risk of local recurrence. We performed a Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score weighting to evaluate breast cancer mortality between the two groups.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 32,144 eligible patients with DCIS, 20,329 (63%) in the RT group and 11,815 (37%) in the non-RT group. Overall, 304 breast cancer-specific deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 96 months, with a cumulative incidence of breast cancer mortality at 10 years in the weighted cohorts of 1.8% (RT group) and 2.1% (non-RT group; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.88). Significant improvements in survival in the RT group compared with the non-RT group were only observed in patients with higher nuclear grade, younger age, and larger tumor size. The magnitude of the survival difference with RT was significantly correlated with prognostic score (P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this population-based study, the patient prognostic score for DCIS is associated with the magnitude of improvement in survival offered by RT after BCS, suggesting that decisions for RT could be tailored on the basis of patient factors, tumor biology, and the prognostic score.",

        "Methods": "Collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modern aromatase inhibitors.",
        "Results/Findings": "Allocation to about 6 months of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC) reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38% (SE 5) for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by about 20% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed, largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0.0001 for recurrence, 2p<0.00001 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than CMF chemotherapy. Few women of age 70 years or older entered these chemotherapy trials. For ER-positive disease only, allocation to about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31% (SE 3), largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50, 50-69, > or =70 years), progesterone receptor status, or other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly (2p<0.00001 for recurrence, 2p=0.01 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses: anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women); CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14,000); anthracycline-based versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14,000); about 5 years of tamoxifen versus none (15,000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen versus none (33,000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of tamoxifen (18,000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of 38% (age <50 years) and 20% (age 50-69 years) from such chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31% from tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality reductions would be 57% and 45%, respectively (and, the trial results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival would be comparably improved, since these treatments have relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all other causes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Some of the widely practicable adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s, which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further improvements in long-term survival could well be available from newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.",

        "Background/Purpose": "PURPOSE We review the evidence on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging the affected breast to determine its accuracy and impact on treatment. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of the accuracy of MRI in detection of multifocal (MF) and/or multicentric (MC) cancer not identified on conventional imaging. We estimated summary receiver operating characteristic curves, positive predictive value (PPV), true-positive (TP) to false positive (FP) ratio, and examined their variability according to quality criteria. Pooled estimates of the proportion of women whose surgery was altered were calculated. Results Data from 19 studies showed MRI detects additional disease in 16% of women with breast cancer (N = 2,610). MRI incremental accuracy differed according to the reference standard (RS; P = .016) decreasing from 99% to 86% as the quality of the RS increased. Summary PPV was 66% (95% CI, 52% to 77%) and TP:FP ratio was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.09 to 3.34). Conversion from wide local excision (WLE) to mastectomy was 8.1% (95% CI, 5.9 to 11.3), from WLE to more extensive surgery was 11.3% in MF/MC disease (95% CI, 6.8 to 18.3). Due to MRI-detected lesions (in women who did not have additional malignancy on histology) conversion from WLE to mastectomy was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.3 to 3.6) and from WLE to more extensive surgery was 5.5% (95% CI, 3.1 to 9.5). CONCLUSION MRI staging causes more extensive breast surgery in an important proportion of women by identifying additional cancer, however there is a need to reduce FP MRI detection. Randomized trials are needed to determine the clinical value of detecting additional disease which changes surgical treatment in women with apparently localized breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "PURPOSE To update the 2002 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on pharmacologic interventions for breast cancer (BC) risk reduction. METHODS A literature search identified relevant randomized trials published since 2002. Primary outcome of interest was BC incidence (invasive and noninvasive). Secondary outcomes included BC mortality, adverse events, and net health benefits. An expert panel reviewed the literature and developed updated consensus guidelines. Results Seventeen articles met inclusion criteria. In premenopausal women, tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the risk of BC for at least 10 years, particularly estrogen receptor (ER) -positive invasive tumors. Women < or = 50 years of age experience fewer serious side effects. Vascular and vasomotor events do not persist post-treatment across all ages. In postmenopausal women, raloxifene and tamoxifen reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive BC with equal efficacy. Raloxifene is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women. No evidence exists establishing whether a reduction in BC risk from either agent translates into reduced BC mortality. Recommendations In women at increased risk for BC, tamoxifen (20 mg/d for 5 years) may be offered to reduce the risk of invasive ER-positive BC, with benefits for at least 10 years. In postmenopausal women, raloxifene (60 mg/d for 5 years) may also be considered. Use of aromatase inhibitors, fenretinide, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators to lower BC risk is not recommended outside of a clinical trial. Discussion of risks and benefits of preventive agents by health providers is critical to patient decision making.",

        "Background/Purpose": "PURPOSE To investigate whether hormonal receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) change throughout tumor progression, because this may alter patient management. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study cohort included female patients with breast cancer in the Stockholm health care region who relapsed from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2007. Either biochemical or immunohistochemical (IHC)/immunocytochemical (ICC) methods were used to determine estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status, which was then confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization for IHC/ICC 2+ and 3+ status. Results ER (459 patients), PR (430 patients), and HER2 (104 patients) from both primary tumor and relapse were assessed, revealing a change in 32.4% (McNemar's test P < .001), 40.7% (P < .001), and 14.5% (P = .44) of patients, respectively. Assessment of ER (119 patients), PR (116 patients), and HER2 (32 patients) with multiple (from two to six) consecutive relapses showed an alteration in 33.6%, 32.0%, and 15.7% of patients, respectively. A statistically significant differential overall survival related to intraindividual ER and PR status in primary tumor and relapse (log-rank P < .001) was noted. In addition, women with ER-positive primary tumors that changed to ER-negative tumors had a significant 48% increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.05) compared with women with stable ER-positive tumors. CONCLUSION Patients with breast cancer experience altered hormone receptor and HER2 status throughout tumor progression, possibly influenced by adjuvant therapies, which significantly influences survival. Hence, marker investigations at relapse may potentially improve patient management and survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "PURPOSE To determine whether the Recurrence Score (RS) provided independent information on risk of distant recurrence (DR) in the tamoxifen and anastrozole arms of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) Trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS RNA was extracted from 1,372 tumor blocks from postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer in the monotherapy arms of ATAC. Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001). Nine-year DR rates in low (RS < 18), intermediate (RS = 18 to 30), and high RS (RS > or = 31) groups were 4%, 12%, and 25%, respectively, in N0 patients and 17%, 28%, and 49%, respectively, in N+ patients. The prognostic value of RS was similar in anastrozole- and tamoxifen-treated patients. CONCLUSION This study confirmed the performance of RS in postmenopausal HR+ patients treated with tamoxifen in a large contemporary population and demonstrated that RS is an independent predictor of DR in N0 and N+ hormone receptor-positive patients treated with anastrozole, adding value to estimates with standard clinicopathologic features.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose The PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence (ROR) score has been validated in randomized clinical trials to predict 10-year distant recurrence (DR). The value of Prosigna for predicting DR was examined in a comprehensive nationwide Danish cohort consisting of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer treated with 5 years of endocrine therapy alone. Patients and Methods Using the population-based Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group database, follow-up data were collected on all patients diagnosed from 2000 through 2003 who, by nationwide guidelines, were treated with endocrine therapy for 5 years. Primary tumor blocks from 2,740 patients were tested with Prosigna and, after determination of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, data from 2,558 hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative samples were analyzed, including 1,395 node-positive patients. Fine and Gray models were applied to determine the prognostic value of ROR for DR. Results Median follow-up for recurrence was 9.2 years. Twenty-six percent of the node-positive patients were classified as low ROR (n = 359) with a DR risk of 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9% to 6.1%) versus a DR risk of 22.1% (95% CI, 18.6% to 25.8%) at 10 years for patients classified as high ROR (n = 648). Node-negative patients classified as low and high ROR had a risk of DR of 5.0% (95% CI, 2.9% to 8.0%) and 17.8% (95% CI, 14.0% to 22.0%), respectively. Luminal B tumors (n = 947; DR risk, 18.4% [95% CI: 15.7% to 21.3%]) had a significantly worse outcome than luminal A tumors (n = 1,474,;DR risk, 7.6% [95% CI: 6.1% to 9.2%]; P < .001). Conclusion Prosigna ROR score improved the prediction of outcome in this nationwide Danish population. In a real-world setting, Prosigna can reliably identify node-negative patients and a significant proportion of patients with one to three positive nodes who can be spared treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose MONARCH 2 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ) compared the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor, plus fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Patients and Methods MONARCH 2 was a global, double-blind, phase III study of women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who had progressed while receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), ≤ 12 months from the end of adjuvant ET, or while receiving first-line ET for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily) on a continuous schedule and fulvestrant (500 mg, per label). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), and key secondary end points included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, quality of life, and safety. Results Between August 2014 and December 2015, 669 patients were randomly assigned to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (n = 446) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 223). Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant significantly extended PFS versus fulvestrant alone (median, 16.4 v 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.553; 95% CI, 0.449 to 0.681; P < .001). In patients with measurable disease, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant achieved an ORR of 48.1% (95% CI, 42.6% to 53.6%) compared with 21.3% (95% CI, 15.1% to 27.6%) in the control arm. The most common adverse events in the abemaciclib versus placebo arms were diarrhea (86.4% v 24.7%), neutropenia (46.0% v 4.0%), nausea (45.1% v 22.9%), and fatigue (39.9% v 26.9%). Conclusions Abemaciclib at 150 mg twice daily plus fulvestrant was effective, significantly improving PFS and ORR and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who progressed while receiving ET.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Purpose Limited data exist on the molecular biology, treatment, and outcomes of breast cancer in men, and much of our understanding in this area remains largely an extrapolation from data in women with breast cancer. Materials and Methods We studied men and women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and the 21-gene Breast Recurrence Score (RS) results. Differences in clinical characteristics and gene expression were determined, and distribution of RS results was correlated with 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival. Results There were 3,806 men and 571,115 women. Men were older than women (mean age, 64.2 v 59.1 years; P < .001). RS < 18 predominated in both genders, but RS ≥ 31 was more frequent in men (12.4% v 7.4%; P < .001), as were very low scores (RS < 11; 33.8% v 22.1%; P < .001). Mean gene expression was higher in men for the estrogen receptor (ER), proliferation, and invasion groups. ER was lowest and progesterone receptor was highest in women younger than 50 years of age, with a progressive increase in ER with age. Men younger than 50 years of age had slightly lower ER and progesterone receptor compared with older men. Survival data were available from SEER for 322 men and 55,842 women. Five-year BCSS was 99.0% (95% CI, 99.3% to 99.9%) and 95.9% (95% CI, 87.6% to 98.7%) for men with RS < 18 and RS 18-30, respectively, and for women, it was 99.5% (95% CI, 99.4% to 99.6%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 98.4% to 98.8%), respectively. RS ≥ 31 was associated with an 81.0% 5-year BCSS in men (95% CI, 53.3% to 93.2%) and 94.9% 5-year BCSS (95% CI, 93.9% to 95.7%) in women. Five-year BCSS and overall survival were lower in men than in women. Conclusion This study reveals some distinctive biologic features of breast cancer in men and an important prognostic role for RS testing in both men and women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "PURPOSE Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent not used routinely for breast cancer treatment. As a DNA cross-linking agent, cisplatin may be effective treatment for hereditary BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. Because sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA1-associated breast cancer share features suggesting common pathogenesis, we conducted a neoadjuvant trial of cisplatin in TNBC and explored specific biomarkers to identify predictors of response. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-eight women with stage II or III breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2/Neu (TNBC) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with BRCA1 germline mutations;18 (64%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14%) progressed. All TNBCs clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low BRCA1 mRNA expression (P = .03), BRCA1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). CONCLUSION Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with TNBC. Decreased BRCA1 expression may identify subsets of TNBCs that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response.",

Methods MONARCH 3 is a double-blind, randomized phase III study of abemaciclib or placebo plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had no prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Patients received abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily continuous schedule) plus either 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily. The primary objective was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included response evaluation and safety. A planned interim analysis occurred after 189 events. Results Median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the abemaciclib arm (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.72; P = .000021; median: not reached in the abemaciclib arm, 14.7 months in the placebo arm). In patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate was 59% in the abemaciclib arm and 44% in the placebo arm ( P = .004). In the abemaciclib arm, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse effect (81.3%) but was mainly grade 1 (44.6%). Comparing abemaciclib and placebo, the most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (21.1% v 1.2%), diarrhea (9.5% v 1.2%), and leukopenia (7.6% v 0.6%). Conclusion Abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor was effective as initial therapy, significantly improving progression-free survival and objective response rate and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.",

After 27 months of study, treatment occurred in 24 per cent of 179 control patients and in 5.3 per cent of 207 women given combination chemotherapy (P less than 10(-6)), the advantage appearing statistically significant in all subgroups of patients. Patients with four or more positive axillary nodes had a higher per cent of relapses than those with fewer nodes. The initial new clinical manifestations occurred in distant sites in 81.5 per cent of relapsed patients. Long-term chemotherapy produced an acceptable toxicity, thus allowing the administration of a high percentage of drug dosage.

After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2.7 to 25.0), 58 of 784 patients (7.4%) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 46 of 390 patients (11.8%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group had disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, had local or distant recurrence or a second primary tumor, or died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.93). Across all treatment phases, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 78.0% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 73.0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% (3 patients) and 0.3% (1 patient), respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, the percentage with a pathological complete response was significantly higher among those who received pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy than among those who received placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

        "Background/Purpose": "Previous studies of hypofractionated adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy for early breast cancer established a 15- or 16-fraction (fr) regimen as standard. The FAST Trial (CRUKE/04/015) evaluated normal tissue effects (NTE) and disease outcomes after 5-fr regimens. Ten-year results are presented.",
        "Methods": "Women ≥ 50 years of age with low-risk invasive breast carcinoma (pT1-2 pN0) were randomly assigned to 50 Gy/25 fr (5 weeks) or 30 or 28.5 Gy in 5 once-weekly fr of 6.0 or 5.7 Gy. The primary end point was change in photographic breast appearance at 2 and 5 years; secondary end points were physician assessments of NTE and local tumor control. Odds ratios (ORs) from longitudinal analyses compared regimens.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 915 women were recruited from 18 UK centers (2004-2007). Five-year photographs were available for 615/862 (71%) eligible patients. ORs for change in photographic breast appearance were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.49;   = .019) for 30 Gy and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.71;   = .686) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. α/β estimate for photographic end point was 2.7 Gy (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.9 Gy), giving a 5-fr schedule of 28 Gy (95% CI, 26 to 30 Gy) estimated to be isoeffective with 50 Gy/25 fr. ORs for any moderate/marked physician-assessed breast NTE (shrinkage, induration, telangiectasia, edema) were 2.12 (95% CI, 1.55 to 2.89;   < .001) for 30 Gy and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.72;   = .248) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. With 9.9 years median follow-up, 11 ipsilateral breast cancer events (50 Gy: 3; 30 Gy: 4; 28.5 Gy: 4) and 96 deaths (50 Gy: 30; 30 Gy: 33; 28.5 Gy: 33) have occurred.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "At 10 years, there was no significant difference in NTE rates after 28.5 Gy/5 fr compared with 50 Gy/25 fr, but NTE were higher after 30 Gy/5 fr. Results confirm the published 3-year findings that a once-weekly 5-fr schedule of whole-breast radiotherapy can be identified that appears to be radiobiologically comparable for NTE to a conventionally fractionated regimen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Previous studies have shown that the addition of carboplatin to neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in patients suffering from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and patients who obtained a pCR could achieve prolonged event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). However, no studies have assessed the effects of the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin without anthracycline with taxane-based and anthracycline-based regimens. The NeoCART study was designed as a multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of docetaxel combined with carboplatin in untreated stage II-III TNBC. All eligible patients were randomly assigned, at a 1:1 ratio, to an experimental docetaxel plus carboplatin (DCb) for six cycles group (DCb group) or an epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide for four cycles followed by docetaxel for four cycles group (EC-D group). PCR (ypT0/is ypN0) was evaluated as the primary outcome. Between 1 September 2016 and 31 December 2019, 93 patients were randomly assigned and 88 patients were evaluated for the primary endpoint (44 patients in each group). In the primary endpoint analysis, 27 patients in the DCb group (61.4%, 95% CI 47.0-75.8) and 17 patients in the EC-D group achieved a pCR (38.6%, 95% CI 24.3-53.0; odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI 2.4-43.1; P  = .004). Noninferiority was met, and the DCb regimen was confirmed to be superior to the EC-D regimen (P = .044, superiority margin of 5%). At the end of the 37-month median follow-up period, OS and EFS rates were equivalent in both groups.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Previous studies have independently validated the prognostic relevance of residual cancer burden (RCB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We used results from several independent cohorts in a pooled patient-level analysis to evaluate the relationship of RCB with long-term prognosis across different phenotypic subtypes of breast cancer, to assess generalisability in a broad range of practice settings.",
        "Methods": "In this pooled analysis, 12 institutes and trials in Europe and the USA were identified by personal communications with site investigators. We obtained participant-level RCB results, and data on clinical and pathological stage, tumour subtype and grade, and treatment and follow-up in November, 2019, from patients (aged ≥18 years) with primary stage I-III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. We assessed the association between the continuous RCB score and the primary study outcome, event-free survival, using mixed-effects Cox models with the incorporation of random RCB and cohort effects to account for between-study heterogeneity, and stratification to account for differences in baseline hazard across cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor status and HER2 status. The association was further evaluated within each breast cancer subtype in multivariable analyses incorporating random RCB and cohort effects and adjustments for age and pretreatment clinical T category, nodal status, and tumour grade. Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free survival at 3, 5, and 10 years were computed for each RCB class within each subtype.",
        "Results/Findings": "We analysed participant-level data from 5161 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy between Sept 12, 1994, and Feb 11, 2019. Median age was 49 years (IQR 20-80). 1164 event-free survival events occurred during follow-up (median follow-up 56 months [IQR 0-186]). RCB score was prognostic within each breast cancer subtype, with higher RCB score significantly associated with worse event-free survival. The univariable hazard ratio (HR) associated with one unit increase in RCB ranged from 1·55 (95% CI 1·41-1·71) for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative patients to 2·16 (1·79-2·61) for the hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive group (with or without HER2-targeted therapy; p<0·0001 for all subtypes). RCB score remained prognostic for event-free survival in multivariable models adjusted for age, grade, T category, and nodal status at baseline: the adjusted HR ranged from 1·52 (1·36-1·69) in the hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative group to 2·09 (1·73-2·53) in the hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive group (p<0·0001 for all subtypes).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "RCB score and class were independently prognostic in all subtypes of breast cancer, and generalisable to multiple practice settings. Although variability in hormone receptor subtype definitions and treatment across patients are likely to affect prognostic performance, the association we observed between RCB and a patient's residual risk suggests that prospective evaluation of RCB could be considered to become part of standard pathology reporting after neoadjuvant therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Previous studies have demonstrated that both anastrozole and letrozole are well tolerated. Letrozole suppresses estrogen to a greater degree than anastrozole in the serum and breast tumor. Concerns have been raised that greater potency may adversely affect patients' quality of life (QOL). One hundred eighty-one postmenopausal women with invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole or the reverse sequence. One hundred and six received immediate adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) following surgery, and 75 received extended adjuvant therapy. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Endocrine Subscale (FACT-B-ES) QOL questionnaires were completed to assess QOL on each drug. Additional side-effect profiles were collected. Each patient completed a patient preference form. Twenty-one patients withdrew before study end, 10/179 (5.6%) while taking letrozole and 4/173 (2.3%) while taking anastrozole (P = 0.12). Tamoxifen-naïve patients had a higher mean ES (endocrine symptoms subscale) score at entry versus those having extended therapy (66.0 vs. 61.9; P = 0.001). There was no significant change in FACT-B-ES (overall) scores or ES scores while patients were taking anastrozole or letrozole and no significant differences between drugs. Nearly 80% of patients reported one or more side effects with either agent. No differences in frequency, grade, or range of side effects were seen between drugs. Of 160 patients, 49 (30.6%) preferred letrozole, 57 (35.6%) preferred anastrozole, and 54 (33.8%) had no preference (P = 0.26, Pearson's Chi-squared test). In conclusion, both AIs are equally well tolerated. There were no significant differences in QOL scores between the two drugs.",

AE recording ceased 30 days after therapy completion (or after switch on the sequential arms).",
        "Results/Findings": "Baseline comorbidities were balanced. At a median follow-up time of 30.1 months, we observed similar overall incidence of cardiac AEs (letrozole, 4.8%; tamoxifen, 4.7%), more grade 3 to 5 cardiac AEs on letrozole (letrozole, 2.4%; tamoxifen, 1.4%; P = .001)--an excess only partially attributable to prior hypercholesterolemia--and more overall (tamoxifen, 3.9%; letrozole, 1.7%; P < .001) and grade 3 to 5 thromboembolic AEs on tamoxifen (tamoxifen, 2.3%; letrozole, 0.9%; P < .001). There was no significant difference between tamoxifen and letrozole in incidence of hypertension or cerebrovascular events.",

The aim of the presented retrospective study was to evaluate the benefit of preoperative MRI for patients with breast cancer. Preoperative MRI performed in 121 patients (group A) were compared to 225 patients without preoperative MRI (group B). Patients of group A underwent contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the breast using a 2D FLASH sequence technique (TR/TE/FA 336 ms/5 ms/90 degrees; 32 slices of 4-mm thickness, time of acquisition 1:27 min, contrast agent dosage 0.1 mmol Gd-DTPA/kg bw). All patients had histologically verified breast cancer and follow-up for more than 20 months (mean time group A: 40.3 months, group B: 41 months). Both groups received the same types of systemic treatment after breast conserving surgery. The in-breast tumor recurrence rate in group A was 1/86 (1.2%) compared to 9/133 (6.8%) in group B. Contralateral carcinoma were detected within follow-up in 2/121 (1.7%) in group A vs. 9/225 (4%) in group B. All results were statistically significant (P<0.001).

        "Background/Purpose": "Preoperative aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment promotes breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. To study this treatment option, responses to three AIs were compared in a randomized phase II neoadjuvant trial designed to select agents for phase III investigations.",
        "Methods": "Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical stage II to III ER-positive (Allred score 6-8) breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary end point was clinical response. Secondary end points included BCS, Ki67 proliferation marker changes, the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI), and PAM50-based intrinsic subtype analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI score, or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. PAM50 analysis identified AI-unresponsive nonluminal subtypes (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 enriched or basal-like) in 3.3% of patients. Clinical response and surgical outcomes were similar in luminal A (LumA) versus luminal B tumors; however, a PEPI of 0 (best prognostic group) was highest in the LumA subset (27.1% v 10.7%; P = .004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neoadjuvant AI treatment markedly improved surgical outcomes. Ki67 and PEPI data demonstrated that the three agents tested are biologically equivalent and therefore likely to have similar adjuvant activities. LumA tumors were more likely to have favorable biomarker characteristics after treatment; however, occasional paradoxical increases in Ki67 (12% of tumors with > 5% increase after therapy) suggest treatment-resistant cells, present in some LumA tumors, can be detected by post-treatment profiling.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy are at risk for amenorrhea and impaired fertility. The objective of the current study was to assess levels of mullerian inhibitory substance (MIS), estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and menstrual status, in women undergoing chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "A nested prospective cohort study was conducted in women aged <40 years with breast cancer (BC) who were undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 26). Serum MIS, FSH, and E2 were measured before chemotherapy (baseline) and at Weeks 6, 12, 36, and 52. Controls were 134 age-matched women with known fertility. Hormone levels were compared between the cases and controls at baseline. Differences between amenorrhea and age subgroups were tested using the nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample test using a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.",
        "Results/Findings": "Subjects with BC and age-matched controls had similar baseline MIS levels (median, 0.94 ng/mL vs 0.86 ng/mL;, P > .05). Serum MIS decreased significantly at 6 weeks and remained suppressed for 52 weeks. E2 levels decreased, and FSH levels increased during chemotherapy; however, at 52 weeks, the levels returned to baseline. At 52 weeks, only 1 patient had MIS above the lower normal range, 15 had return of menstrual function, 11 had premenopausal levels of FSH, and 13 had follicular phase levels of E2. In women aged <35 years, 25% remained amenorrheic, whereas in women aged >35 years, 50% were amenorrheic. Amenorrheic and menstruating women were found to have similar MIS values at baseline and follow-up.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In young women with BC, chemotherapy decreases MIS rapidly and dramatically. Rapid reductions in MIS do not appear to be predictive of subsequent menstrual function. Ovarian reserve and endocrine function may be affected differently by chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Preclinical data suggest that triple-negative breast cancers are sensitive to interstrand crosslinking agents, and that synergy may exist for the combination of a taxane, trastuzumab, and a platinum salt for HER2-positive breast cancer. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy of the addition of carboplatin to neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Patients with previously untreated, non-metastatic, stage II-III, triple-negative breast cancer and HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were treated for 18 weeks with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) once a week) and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (20 mg/m(2) once a week). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer received simultaneous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). Patients with HER2-positive disease received simultaneous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg initial dose with subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) and lapatinib (750 mg daily). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with dynamic allocation and minimisation, stratified by biological subtype and Ki-67 level to receive, at the same time as the backbone regimens, either carboplatin (AUC 1·5 [2·0 for the first 329 patients] once a week) or no carboplatin. The primary endpoint the proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response (defined as ypT0 ypN0), analysed for all patients who started treatment; a p value of less than 0·2 was deemed significant for the primary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "296 patients were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin and 299 to no additional carboplatin, of whom 295 and 293 started treatment, respectively. In this final analysis, 129 patients (43·7%, 95% CI 38·1-49·4) in the carboplatin group achieved a pathological complete response, compared with 108 patients (36·9%, 31·3-42·4) without carboplatin (odds ratio 1·33, 95% CI 0·96-1·85; p=0·107). Of the patients with triple-negative breast cancer, 84 (53·2%, 54·4-60·9) of 158 patients achieved a pathological complete response with carboplatin, compared with 58 (36·9%, 29·4-44·5) of 157 without (p=0·005). Of the patients with HER2-positive tumours, 45 (32·8%, 25·0-40·7) of 137 patients achieved a pathological complete response with carboplatin compared with 50 (36·8%, 28·7-44·9) of 136 without (p=0·581; test for interaction p=0·015). Haematological and non-haematological toxic effects that were significantly more common in the carboplatin group than in the no-carboplatin group included grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (192 [65%] vs 79 [27%]), grade 3 or 4 anaemia (45 [15%] vs one [<1%]), grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (42 [14%] vs one [<1%]), and grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (51 [17%] vs 32 [11%]); carboplatin was more often associated with dose discontinuations (141 [48%] with carboplatin and 114 [39%] without carboplatin; p=0·031). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 haematological events decreased from 82% (n=135) to 70% (n=92) and grade 3 or 4 non-haematological events from 78% (n=128) to 59% (n=77) in the carboplatin arm when the dose of carboplatin was reduced from AUC 2·0 to 1·5.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of neoadjuvant carboplatin to a regimen of a taxane, an anthracycline, and targeted therapy significantly increases the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response. This regimen seems to increase responses in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, but not in those with HER2-positive breast cancer.",

Evidence of resistance from clinical studies has been inconsistent. The present study examined whether HER-2 gene amplification or HER-1 expression predicted response to tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "Three hundred and forty nine patients had estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer and received daily tamoxifen as initial therapy for advanced disease. HER-2 gene amplification, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and HER-1 expression, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, was determined on 136 and 204 patients, respectively.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER-2 amplification was correlated with lower ER (P = 0.02), HER-1 positivity (P = 0.004), and HER-2 protein overexpression (P < 0.00001). The response rate was 56% for HER-2 non-amplified versus 47% for HER-2 amplified tumors (P = 0.38), and 58% for HER-1-negative versus 36% for HER-1-positive (P = 0.05). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 7 months for non-amplified HER-2 tumors and 5 months (P = 0.007) for amplified HER-2 tumors, and there was a trend toward a better overall survival (OS) in patients with non-amplified HER-2 tumors (median 31 versus 25 months, respectively, P = 0.07). For positive versus negative HER-1 tumors, TTF was 4 versus 8 months (P = 0.08) and median survival was 24 versus 31 months (P = 0.41). Combining HER-1 expression and HER-2 gene status, patients with both negative HER-1 expression and non-amplified HER-2 had longer TTF (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.03) than if either were positive. In multivariate analysis, HER-2 was not an independent factor for TTF and OS, although HER-1 was significant for TTF only (P </= 0.001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with HER-2 amplification and HER-1 expression had lower ER levels and were modestly less responsive to tamoxifen, suggesting that molecular events in addition to those involving the ErbB receptors are important in determining the endocrine-resistant phenotype.",

To improve outcomes, it is important to preoperatively identify factors that might predispose to infection and minimize them when possible. It is hypothesized that certain patient characteristics are associated with an increased infection rate.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective, 6-year, single-institution review of patient records was performed from 413 tissue expanders placed in 300 women for postmastectomy breast reconstruction. Infection was defined as any case where antibiotics were given in response to clinical signs of infection. Fourteen potential risk factors were analyzed. A generalized estimation equations approach was used to perform univariable and multivariable analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "Antibiotics were given to treat clinical infection in 68 of 413 expanders (16.5 percent), with a median time to diagnosis of 6.5 weeks (range, 1 to 52 weeks). Univariable analysis showed significant association with breast size larger than C cup (p < 0.001), previous irradiation (p = 0.007), repeated implant (p = 0.008), and delayed reconstruction (p = 0.04). All variables except delayed reconstruction remained significant (p < 0.002 for all) in a multivariable model. Additional significant covariates in this model included one surgical oncologist (p = 0.003) and contralateral surgery (p = 0.046). Given infection, one surgical oncologist was associated with an increased rate of mastectomy flap necrosis (p = 0.01).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Certain patient characteristics are associated with increased infection in tissue expansion breast reconstruction. Understanding how these predispose to infection requires additional study. Patients identified with these characteristics should be educated about these risks and other reconstructive options to optimize the success of their breast reconstruction.",

The BOLERO-2 trial demonstrated that adding everolimus (EVE) to EXE improved progression-free survival (PFS) while maintaining quality of life when compared with EXE alone. Because many women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer are elderly, the tolerability profile of EVE plus EXE in this population is of interest.",

Safety and efficacy data in elderly patients are reported at 18-month median follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "Baseline disease characteristics and treatment histories among the elderly subsets (≥ 65 years, n = 275; ≥ 70 years, n = 164) were generally comparable with younger patients. The addition of EVE to EXE improved PFS regardless of age (hazard ratio, 0.59 [≥ 65 years] and 0.45 [≥ 70 years]). Adverse events (AEs) of special interest (all grades) that occurred more frequently with EVE than with PBO included stomatitis, infections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia. Elderly EVE-treated patients had similar incidences of these AEs as did younger patients but had more on-treatment deaths.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adding EVE to EXE offers substantially improved PFS over EXE and was generally well tolerated in elderly patients with HR(+) advanced breast cancer. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose reductions or interruptions for AE management are recommended during treatment with EVE in this patient population.",

However, the benefit in women with only one to three positive lymph nodes is uncertain. We aimed to assess the effect of radiotherapy in these women after mastectomy and axillary dissection.",
        "Methods": "We did a meta-analysis of individual data for 8135 women randomly assigned to treatment groups during 1964-86 in 22 trials of radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes after mastectomy and axillary surgery versus the same surgery but no radiotherapy. Follow-up lasted 10 years for recurrence and to Jan 1, 2009, for mortality. Analyses were stratified by trial, individual follow-up year, age at entry, and pathological nodal status.",
        "Results/Findings": "3786 women had axillary dissection to at least level II and had zero, one to three, or four or more positive nodes. All were in trials in which radiotherapy included the chest wall, supraclavicular or axillary fossa (or both), and internal mammary chain. For 700 women with axillary dissection and no positive nodes, radiotherapy had no significant effect on locoregional recurrence (two-sided significance level [2p]>0·1), overall recurrence (rate ratio [RR], irradiated vs not, 1·06, 95% CI 0·76-1·48, 2p>0·1), or breast cancer mortality (RR 1·18, 95% CI 0·89-1·55, 2p>0·1). For 1314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·57-0·82, 2p=0·00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·67-0·95, 2p=0·01). 1133 of these 1314 women were in trials in which systemic therapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, or tamoxifen) was given in both trial groups and, for them, radiotherapy again reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·55-0·82, 2p=0·00009), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·78, 95% CI 0·64-0·94, 2p=0·01). For 1772 women with axillary dissection and four or more positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·69-0·90, 2p=0·0003), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·77-0·99, 2p=0·04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After mastectomy and axillary dissection, radiotherapy reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the women with one to three positive lymph nodes in these trials even when systemic therapy was given. For today's women, who in many countries are at lower risk of recurrence, absolute gains might be smaller but proportional gains might be larger because of more effective radiotherapy.",

In total there were 321 (47%) and 411 (60%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24% in the tamoxifen alone group (p<0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36% at 10 years, p=0.03).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Postmastectomy radiotherapy (RT) in high-risk breast cancer patients can reduce locoregional recurrences (LRRs) and improve disease-free and overall survival. The aim of this analysis was to examine the overall disease recurrence pattern among patients randomly assigned to receive treatment with or without RT.",
        "Methods": "A long-term follow-up was performed among the 3,083 patients from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82 b and c trials, except in those already recorded with distant metastases (DM) or contralateral breast cancer (CBC). The end points were LRR, DM, and CBC, and the follow-up continued until DM, CBC, emigration, or death. Information was selected from medical records, general practitioners, and the National Causes of Death Registry. The median potential follow-up time was 18 years.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 18-year probability of any first breast cancer event was 73% and 59% (P < .001) after no RT and RT, respectively (relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.75). The 18-year probability of LRR (with or without DM) was 49% and 14% (P < .001) after no RT and RT, respectively (RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.27). The 18-year probability of DM subsequent to LRR was 35% and 6% (P < .001) after no RT and RT, respectively (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.20), whereas the probability of any DM was 64% and 53% (P < .001) after no RT versus RT, respectively (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.86).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postmastectomy RT changes the disease recurrence pattern in high-risk breast cancer patients; fewer patients have LRR as first site of recurrence, and overall fewer patients have DM.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Postmastectomy chest wall and nodal radiation therapy decreases local recurrence and improves disease-free and overall survival. Immediate transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction after mastectomy has become more common. We report on our experience of irradiating the chest wall and regional lymph nodes after a TRAM flap reconstruction and describe the acute side effects, flap viability, and cosmetic outcome. Between 1995 and 2000, 22 patients with a median age of 47 years (range 27-61 years) received chest wall radiotherapy following mastectomy and immediate pedicled TRAM flap reconstruction. The indication for radiotherapy included tumor size, involved lymph nodes, or positive margins. All patients received chemotherapy before radiotherapy and three patients also received concurrent chemotherapy. The median dose to the chest wall was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy using a 6 or 4 MV linear accelerator. The patients were all computed tomography (CT) planned in the treatment position. The patients were immobilized using an alpha cradle. Two tangent fields were used to deliver the dose. On alternating days, a customized bolus was applied to the chest wall that spared the central region where the subsequent nipple reconstruction would be performed. All 22 patients completed 90% of the prescribed chest wall radiotherapy dose. Sixty-six percent of the patients received treatment without any treatment breaks. Only 10% of the patients developed desquamation of the TRAM flap skin. Thirty percent developed grade II erythema of the TRAM flap. With median follow-up of 18 months, no TRAM flaps have been lost or required revision. This technique for delivery of radiotherapy to the chest wall in patients who have undergone a mastectomy and immediate TRAM flap reconstruction is well tolerated. The acute toxicity was manageable. There were no TRAM flap losses or revisions performed secondary to the radiotherapy.",

Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to 1 year of oral olaparib or placebo. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1836 patients underwent randomization. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 85.9% in the olaparib group and 77.1% in the placebo group (difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 13.0; hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.82; P<0.001). The 3-year distant disease-free survival was 87.5% in the olaparib group and 80.4% in the placebo group (difference, 7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.0 to 11.1; hazard ratio for distant disease or death, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.39 to 0.83; P<0.001). Olaparib was associated with fewer deaths than placebo (59 and 86, respectively) (hazard ratio, 0.68; 99% CI, 0.44 to 1.05; P = 0.02); however, the between-group difference was not significant at an interim-analysis boundary of a P value of less than 0.01. Safety data were consistent with known side effects of olaparib, with no excess serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with high-risk, HER2-negative early breast cancer and germline   or   pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, adjuvant olaparib after completion of local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer survival free of invasive or distant disease than was placebo. Olaparib had limited effects on global patient-reported quality of life. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and AstraZeneca; OlympiA ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Placing clips in nodes with biopsy-confirmed metastasis before initiating neoadjuvant therapy allows for evaluation of response in breast cancer. Our goal was to determine if pathologic changes in clipped nodes reflect the status of the nodal basin and if targeted axillary dissection (TAD), which includes sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and selective localization and removal of clipped nodes, improves the false-negative rate (FNR) compared with SLND alone.",
        "Methods": "A prospective study of patients with biopsy-confirmed nodal metastases with a clip placed in the sampled node was performed. After neoadjuvant therapy, patients underwent axillary surgery and the pathology of the clipped node was compared with other nodes. Patients undergoing TAD had SLND and selective removal of the clipped node using iodine-125 seed localization. The FNR was determined in patients undergoing complete axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 208 patients enrolled in this study, 191 underwent ALND, with residual disease identified in 120 (63%). The clipped node revealed metastases in 115 patients, resulting in an FNR of 4.2% (95% CI, 1.4 to 9.5) for the clipped node. In patients undergoing SLND and ALND (n = 118), the FNR was 10.1% (95% CI, 4.2 to 19.8), which included seven false-negative events in 69 patients with residual disease. Adding evaluation of the clipped node reduced the FNR to 1.4% (95% CI, 0.03 to 7.3; P = .03). The clipped node was not retrieved as an SLN in 23% (31 of 134) of patients, including six with negative SLNs but metastasis in the clipped node. TAD followed by ALND was performed in 85 patients, with an FNR of 2.0% (1 of 50; 95% CI, 0.05 to 10.7).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Physical activity has been related to improved breast cancer outcomes. Especially in the older breast cancer population, physical activity may be important because old age is associated with comorbidities and decreased physical function.

        "Results/Findings": "Among 521 patients, high levels of physical activity before and after the diagnosis were associated with better overall survival (the multivariate hazard ratios were 0.50 [95% confidence interval = 0.26-0.98] and 0.57 (95% confidence interval = 0.26-1.40] for patients who were very active before and after the diagnosis, respectively, in comparison with inactive patients). This was most evident in patients who were 65 years old or older. Physical activity was not significantly associated with breast cancer-specific survival or the relapse-free period.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Overall survival was better for patients who were active before and after the diagnosis. In contrast with previous studies, breast cancer survival and the risk of recurrence were not significantly associated with physical activity. These findings confirmed the need for more studies investigating the use of physical activity to supplement breast cancer treatment in older patients.",

Improvements in absolute OS rates were 10% at 6 months and 15% at 12 months in the combination arm compared with the monotherapy arm. Multiple baseline factors, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, nonvisceral disease, < three metastatic sites, and less time from initial diagnosis until random assignment, were associated with improved OS.

        "Methods": "In the ongoing multicentre single-arm phase IIIb PERUSE study, patients with inoperable HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (locally recurrent/metastatic) (LR/MBC) and no prior systemic therapy for LR/MBC (except endocrine therapy) received docetaxel, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel with trastuzumab [8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w)] and pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg q3w) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, 1436 patients received at least one treatment dose (initially docetaxel in 775 patients, paclitaxel in 589, nab-paclitaxel in 65; 7 discontinued before starting taxane). Median age was 54 years; 29% had received prior trastuzumab. Median treatment duration was 16 months for pertuzumab and trastuzumab and 4 months for taxane. Compared with docetaxel-containing therapy, paclitaxel-containing therapy was associated with more neuropathy (all-grade peripheral neuropathy 31% versus 16%) but less febrile neutropenia (1% versus 11%) and mucositis (14% versus 25%). At this preliminary analysis (52 months' median follow-up), median PFS was 20.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 18.9-22.7] months overall (19.6, 23.0 and 18.1 months with docetaxel, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel, respectively). ORR was 80% (95% CI 78%-82%) overall (docetaxel 79%, paclitaxel 83%, nab-paclitaxel 77%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Preliminary findings from PERUSE suggest that the safety and efficacy of first-line pertuzumab, trastuzumab and taxane for HER2-positive LR/MBC are consistent with results from CLEOPATRA. Paclitaxel appears to be a valid alternative taxane backbone to docetaxel, offering similar PFS and ORR with a predictable safety profile.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Pembrolizumab monotherapy showed durable antitumour activity and manageable safety in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We aimed to examine whether the addition of pembrolizumab would enhance the antitumour activity of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial, done in 209 sites in 29 countries, we randomly assigned patients 2:1 with untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using a block method (block size of six) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel; paclitaxel; or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by type of on-study chemotherapy (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 expression at baseline (combined positive score [CPS] ≥1 or <1), and previous treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (yes or no). Eligibility criteria included age at least 18 years, centrally confirmed triple-negative breast cancer; at least one measurable lesion; provision of a newly obtained tumour sample for determination of triple-negative breast cancer status and PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 0 or 1; and adequate organ function. The sponsor, investigators, other study site staff (except for the unmasked pharmacist), and patients were masked to pembrolizumab versus saline placebo administration. In addition, the sponsor, the investigators, other study site staff, and patients were masked to patient-level tumour PD-L1 biomarker results. Dual primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival assessed in the PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, CPS of 1 or more, and intention-to-treat populations. The definitive assessment of progression-free survival was done at this interim analysis; follow-up to assess overall survival is continuing. For progression-free survival, a hierarchical testing strategy was used, such that testing was done first in patients with CPS of 10 or more (prespecified statistical criterion was α=0·00411 at this interim analysis), then in patients with CPS of 1 or more (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis, with partial alpha from progression-free survival in patients with CPS of 10 or more passed over), and finally in the intention-to-treat population (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 9, 2017, and June 12, 2018, of 1372 patients screened, 847 were randomly assigned to treatment, with 566 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 281 patients in the placebo-chemotherapy group. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff, Dec 11, 2019), median follow-up was 25·9 months (IQR 22·8-29·9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 26·3 months (22·7-29·7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Among patients with CPS of 10 or more, median progression-free survival was 9·7 months with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy and 5·6 months with placebo-chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for progression or death, 0·65, 95% CI 0·49-0·86; one-sided p=0·0012 [primary objective met]). Median progression-free survival was 7·6 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·74, 0·61-0·90; one-sided p=0·0014 [not significant]) among patients with CPS of 1 or more and 7·5 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·82, 0·69-0·97 [not tested]) among the intention-to-treat population. The pembrolizumab treatment effect increased with PD-L1 enrichment. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event rates were 68% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 67% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in <1% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus placebo-chemotherapy among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with CPS of 10 or more. These findings suggest a role for the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Pembrolizumab is approved for multiple cancer types at 200 mg and 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks (Q3W). We used a model-based approach to compare the exposure of pembrolizumab 400 mg dose every 6 weeks (Q6W) with the Q3W regimens.",
        "Methods": "The Q6W dose was selected by matching exposure with the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W doses. Concentration-time profiles were simulated using the established population pharmacokinetic model of pembrolizumab based on 2993 subjects from five clinical trials across tumour types. Efficacy was bridged by evaluating projections of average concentration over the dosing interval (C ) and trough concentration (C ) at steady state ( ). Safety was bridged by ensuring that concentrations were below those at 10 mg/kg dose every 2 weeks (Q2W), the maximum clinical dose.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 400 mg Q6W dose had similar predicted exposure (C , geometric mean ∼1% higher) as the 200 mg Q3W dose. Fewer than 1% of subjects had transiently lower C  than that observed for 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W. Despite these reductions, similar target saturation is expected. The predicted peak concentrations (C ) for 400 mg Q6W were substantially (∼65%) lower than the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Exposures expected for pembrolizumab 400 mg Q6W were similar to the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W and below the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimens. Established exposure-response relationships for pembrolizumab over a 5-fold dose range (2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg Q2W) support that clinical efficacy and safety of 400 mg Q6W would be similar to the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W doses across tumour types.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Patients with large ER positive tumors candidate to preoperative chemotherapy may also benefit from a concurrent endocrine intervention, but this issue has been scarcely investigated due to concerns arising from unfavorable results emerged from an adjuvant trial of concurrent tamoxifen and chemotherapy. We retrospectively investigated the activity of letrozole plus GnRH analogue (GnRH-a) administered concurrently with preoperative chemotherapy and as adjuvant treatment in premenopausal women with locally advanced ER positive breast cancer consecutively admitted at the European Institute of Oncology. Results were compared with those of a non-randomized unmatched control group of premenopausal women with locally advanced ER positive breast cancer receiving preoperative chemotherapy, followed by tamoxifen and GnRH-a after surgery. Primary endpoints were pathological complete response (pCR) rate, decrease of Ki67 and disease free survival (DFS). One-hundred and nineteen women constituted the study group, while 95 patients served as controls. The pCR rate was 5.0 vs 1.1% in the study and control group, respectively. A statistically significant greater suppression of Ki67 was observed in patients receiving chemoendocrine therapy as compared with controls (P = 0.003). At a median follow up of 59 months, 26 events occurred in the chemoendocrine group and 48 in the control group. Five-year DFS was 78 vs 41% in the study and in the control group, respectively [adjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.79, P = 0.0047]. The concurrent administration of letrozole and GnRH-a with preoperative chemotherapy was highly effective in premenopausal women with large ER positive breast cancer in terms of decreased proliferation and of improved DFS. Randomized studies are warranted to establish the role of the addition of endocrine therapy to chemotherapy as standard preoperative approach for ER positive locally advanced breast cancer as well as of letrozole in combination with GnRH-a for the treatment of premenopauasal women with early breast cancer.",

Eligible patients were enrolled from hospitals worldwide and were centrally randomised (1:1) to chemotherapy (type selected by the investigator; multidrug for at least four courses recommended) or no chemotherapy, using permuted blocks, and stratified by previous chemotherapy, oestrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor status, and location of ILRR. Patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive ILRR received adjuvant endocrine therapy, radiation therapy was mandated for patients with microscopically involved surgical margins, and anti-HER2 therapy was optional. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",

        "Results/Findings": "The five-year actuarial rates of cancer recurrence at any site and of distant metastases in the radiotherapy-first group and the chemotherapy-first group were 38 percent and 31 percent (P = 0.17) and 36 percent and 25 percent (P = 0.05), respectively. Overall survival was 73 percent and 81 percent (P = 0.11), respectively. The five-year crude rates of first recurrence according to site in the radiotherapy-first and chemotherapy-first groups, respectively, were 5 percent and 14 percent for local recurrence and 32 percent and 20 percent for distant or regional recurrence or both. This difference in the pattern of recurrence was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study suggests that for patients ar substantial risk for systemic metastases, it is preferable to give a 12-week course of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy, rather than radiation therapy followed by chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Patients with early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer frequently wish to know if they inherited a mutation in one of the cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2. Accurate carrier prediction models are needed to target costly testing. Two widely used models, BRCAPRO and BOADICEA, were developed using data from non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), but their accuracies have not been evaluated in other racial/ethnic populations.",
        "Methods": "We evaluated the BRCAPRO and BOADICEA models in a population-based series of African American, Hispanic, and NHW breast cancer patients tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. We assessed model calibration by evaluating observed versus predicted mutations and attribute diagrams, and model discrimination using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves.",
        "Results/Findings": "Both models were well-calibrated within each racial/ethnic group, with some exceptions. BOADICEA overpredicted mutations in African Americans and older NHWs, and BRCAPRO underpredicted in Hispanics. In all racial/ethnic groups, the models overpredicted in cases whose personal and family histories indicated >80% probability of carriage. The two models showed similar discrimination in each racial/ethnic group, discriminating least well in Hispanics. For example, BRCAPRO's areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 83% (95% confidence interval, 63-93%) for NHWs, compared with 74% (59-85%) for African Americans and 58% (45-70%) for Hispanics.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The poor performance of the model for Hispanics may be due to model misspecification in this racial/ethnic group. However, it may also reflect racial/ethnic differences in the distributions of personal and family histories among breast cancer cases in the Northern California population.",

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate of trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent emtansine (DM1), a maytansine derivative and microtubule inhibitor, provides benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer that was previously treated with chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial involving patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were found to have residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy containing a taxane (with or without anthracycline) and trastuzumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause).",
        "Results/Findings": "At the interim analysis, among 1486 randomly assigned patients (743 in the T-DM1 group and 743 in the trastuzumab group), invasive disease or death had occurred in 91 patients in the T-DM1 group (12.2%) and 165 patients in the trastuzumab group (22.2%). The estimated percentage of patients who were free of invasive disease at 3 years was 88.3% in the T-DM1 group and 77.0% in the trastuzumab group. Invasive disease-free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001). Distant recurrence as the first invasive-disease event occurred in 10.5% of patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.9% of those in the trastuzumab group. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of T-DM1, with more adverse events associated with T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 130 patients were enrolled, and 128 patients (64 anastrozole, 64 exemestane) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis.

Clinical benefit in visceral sites was 32% of the patients treated with anastrozole and 38% of the patients treated with exemestane. Median survival was 33.3 months and 30.5 months in the anastrozole and exemestane groups, respectively. Toxicities were similar to those previously reported; however, treatment-related adverse events were more frequent with anastrozole (41%) than with exemestane (31%). Both treatments were generally well tolerated in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer with visceral metastases.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Pathological complete response has been proposed as a surrogate endpoint for prediction of long-term clinical benefit, such as disease-free survival, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). We had four key objectives: to establish the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS, to establish the definition of pathological complete response that correlates best with long-term outcome, to identify the breast cancer subtypes in which pathological complete response is best correlated with long-term outcome, and to assess whether an increase in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups predicts improved EFS and OS.",
        "Methods": "We searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline for clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. To be eligible, studies had to meet three inclusion criteria: include at least 200 patients with primary breast cancer treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery; have available data for pathological complete response, EFS, and OS; and have a median follow-up of at least 3 years. We compared the three most commonly used definitions of pathological complete response--ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, and ypT0/is--for their association with EFS and OS in a responder analysis. We assessed the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS in various subgroups. Finally, we did a trial-level analysis to assess whether pathological complete response could be used as a surrogate endpoint for EFS or OS.",
        "Results/Findings": "We obtained data from 12 identified international trials and 11 955 patients were included in our responder analysis. Eradication of tumour from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0) was better associated with improved EFS (ypT0 ypN0: hazard ratio [HR] 0·44, 95% CI 0·39-0·51; ypT0/is ypN0: 0·48, 0·43-0·54) and OS (0·36, 0·30-0·44; 0·36, 0·31-0·42) than was tumour eradication from the breast alone (ypT0/is; EFS: HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·55-0·66; OS 0·51, 0·45-0·58). We used the ypT0/is ypN0 definition for all subsequent analyses. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcomes was strongest in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (EFS: HR 0·24, 95% CI 0·18-0·33; OS: 0·16, 0·11-0·25) and in those with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative tumours who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0·15, 0·09-0·27; OS: 0·08, 0·03, 0·22). In the trial-level analysis, we recorded little association between increases in frequency of pathological complete response and EFS (R(2)=0·03, 95% CI 0·00-0·25) and OS (R(2)=0·24, 0·00-0·70).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients who attain pathological complete response defined as ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0 have improved survival. The prognostic value is greatest in aggressive tumour subtypes. Our pooled analysis could not validate pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS.",

        "Methods": "Three hundred eighty-two women with metastatic breast cancer and lytic bone lesions who received chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either 90 mg of pamidronate or placebo intravenously every 3 to 4 weeks in this double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group trial. Patients were evaluated monthly for 2 years for skeletal complications, which included pathologic fractures, need for radiation or surgery to treat bone complications, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Bone pain, analgesic use, bone biochemical markers, performance status, quality of life, radiologic response in bone, and survival were also evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "As in the first year of treatment, the proportion of patients with any skeletal complication was significantly less for the pamidronate than the placebo group at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months (P < .001). The proportions of patients with any pathologic fracture (i.e., vertebral and nonvertebral fractures), need for radiation or surgery to treat bone complications, and hypercalcemia were also statistically less for the pamidronate than the placebo group. The median time to the first skeletal complication was 13.9 months in the pamidronate-treated women and 7.0 months in the placebo group (P < .001). Long-term treatment did not result in any unexpected adverse events. Survival did not differ between the two groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The risk for osteolytic bone lesion complications in metastatic breast cancer was significantly decreased with monthly infusions of 90 mg of pamidronate, and this effect was maintained for at least 2 years.

Seven hundred fifty-four women with Stage IV breast carcinoma and osteolytic metastases were randomized to the 2 treatment arms of the trial. Three patients were excluded from the intent-to-treat population for the analysis. A total of 751 evaluable patients were randomized to receive either a 90-mg intravenous pamidronate infusion (367 patients) or a placebo infusion (384 patients) every 3-4 weeks. The primary outcome measures were skeletal morbidity rate (events/year), proportion of patients developing a skeletal complication, and time to first skeletal complication.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 367 women receiving pamidronate, 115 (31.3%) completed the trial and 81 (22.1%) discontinued the study due to adverse events. Of the 384 women who received placebo, 100 (26.0%) completed the study and 76 (19.8%) discontinued the study due to adverse events. The skeletal morbidity rate was 2.4 in the pamidronate group and 3.7 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). In the pamidronate group, 186 of the 367 patients (51%) had skeletal complications compared with 246 of the 384 patients in the placebo group (64%) (P < 0.001). The median time to first skeletal complication was 12.7 months in the pamidronate group and 7 months in the placebo group (P < 0.001).

The primary end point of the study was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS); secondary end points were invasive breast cancer-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, locoregional cancer-free survival, and overall survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 5,796 patients enrolled at 406 centers in 21 countries worldwide over 3 years, 5,761 were included in the intention-to-treat population. At the final protocol-defined analysis, at a median follow-up of 31 months, iDFS events occurred in 253 of 2,884 (8.8%) patients who received palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and in 263 of 2,877 (9.1%) patients who received endocrine therapy alone, with similar results between the two treatment groups (iDFS at 4 years: 84.2%   84.5%; hazard ratio, 0.96; CI, 0.81 to 1.14;   = .65). No significant differences were observed for secondary time-to-event end points, and subgroup analyses did not show any differences by subgroup. There were no new safety signals for palbociclib in this trial.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "At this final analysis of the PALLAS trial, the addition of adjuvant palbociclib to standard endocrine therapy did not improve outcomes over endocrine therapy alone in patients with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "After institutional review board approval, a database review of patients with Paget's disease was conducted. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment including use of SLNB, and survival were reviewed. Patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed by using contingency table chi-square, pooled t tests, and log-rank tests for comparisons.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fifty-four patients with Paget's disease were identified and divided into 2 cohorts (18 no SLNB and 36 SLNB). The mean age was 66 years for the no-SLNB group and 60 years for the SLNB group (P = .17). Paget's disease only was present in 33%, Paget's disease + DCIS in 41%, and Paget's disease + invasive cancer in 26%. The mean invasive tumor size was 1.62 cm in the no-SLNB group and 1.59 cm in the SLNB group (P = .96). For invasive disease, ER/PR status was similar, but Her2 was more likely to be overexpressed in SLNB (P = .04). Surgery choice ranged from \"no surgery\" to lumpectomy to mastectomy. Axillary staging was performed in 45 of 54 patients, with 11% in both cohorts having nodal disease. A sentinel lymph node was identified in 97% of patients. Five-year overall and disease-free survival was 100% in the no-SLNB group and 88% in the SLNB group (P = .97) and 76% in the no-SLNB group and 84% in the SLNB group (P = .88), respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Paget's disease remains rare but should be treated similar to other \"breast cancer.\" SLNB should be performed to evaluate the axilla when invasive disease is identified or a mastectomy is planned.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Paget's disease of the breast is a relatively rare condition, accounting for 1% to 3% of primary breast cancers. It is associated with an underlying carcinoma, invasive or noninvasive (ductal carcinoma in situ), in most of the cases. Primary treatment is surgical with adjuvant therapy being dictated by the stage and nature of the underlying tumor. Modified radical mastectomy is the standard of care with breast conservation appropriate in a select group of patients with Paget's disease. This select group includes patients that are diagnosed with nipple-areola changes alone without evidence of a palpable mass or mammographic abnormality. In this group of patients, breast conservation offers local recurrence rates comparable to rates in patients with invasive or noninvasive cancers. In patients diagnosed with associated palpable masses or mammographic abnormalities suggestive of cancer, the recurrence rates are higher and mastectomy is warranted.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Paget's disease of the breast is a rare disorder of the nipple-areola complex that is often associated with an underlying in situ or invasive carcinoma. A change in sensation of the nipple-areola, such as itching and burning, is a common presenting symptom. Objectively, eczematoid changes of the nipple-areola complex are common. The later stages of Paget's disease of the breast are characterized by ulceration and destruction of the nipple-areola complex. Eczematoid changes of the nipple-areola complex and persisting soreness or itching, without obvious reason, is a suspicious symptom for Paget's disease of the breast and calls for thorough evaluation, including mammography. Exfoliative cytology with demonstration of Paget's cells may be useful, but a negative finding does not exclude Paget's disease of the breast. Surgical biopsy is the diagnostic standard and therefore the diagnosis should always be confirmed by open (surgical) biopsy. The histogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast continues to be debated. The epidermotropic theory holds that Paget's cells are ductal carcinoma cells that have migrated from the underlying breast parenchyma to the nipple epidermis. According to the in situ transformation theory, the Paget's cells arise as malignant cells in the nipple epidermis independent from any other pathologic process within the breast parenchyma. This theory has been proposed to explain those cases in which there is no underlying mammary carcinoma or when there is a carcinoma remote from the nipple-areola complex. Each of these theories is plausible; however, treatment approaches differ markedly depending on the theory of histogenesis. Mastectomy has been considered the standard of care in the management of patients with Paget's disease of the breast. Nowadays, however, some patients with Paget's disease of the breast are candidates for breast-conserving therapy. Patients must be selected carefully on an individual basis. Until there is a better understanding of the relationship of Paget's disease of the breast to the underlying cancer the surgeon should understand the natural history and behaviour of this lesion and be aware of both the risks of under- and over-treating patients with Paget's disease of the breast.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Paget's disease (PD) of the breast is an uncommon condition traditionally treated with mastectomy. To assess the natural history and treatment options in PD we have reviewed the experience at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI).",
        "Methods": "The medical records of patients treated for PD at RPCI between 1963 and 1996 were reviewed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Eighty patients were treated in the period reviewed. The median follow up was 61 months. Sixty-eight of 80 patients had nipple changes consistent with PD including 30 who had an associated breast mass (group 1), and 38 who had no associated mass (group 2). Of the 68 patients with clinical PD, 58 (85%) were treated with mastectomy while the remainder were treated with some form of breast conserving therapy. Breast cancer (BC) was found in 56 of 68 patients (82%) with clinical PD, including 28 of 30 patients (93%) in group 1 and 28 of 38 patients (74%) in group 2. Breast cancer was centrally located (within 2 cm of the areolar margin) in 61% of patients, including 71% in group 1 and 50% in group 2. Of the 28 patients with an associated BC in group 1, 21 (75%) had invasive cancer, 6 (21%) had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 16 (57%) had pathologic axillary nodes. Of the 28 patients with an associated BC in group 2, 10 (36%) had invasive cancer, 18 (64%) had DCIS, and 6 (21%) had positive axillary nodes. The median survival was significantly shorter for group 1 (42 months) than for group 2 (126 months; p = 0.007).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Most patients with PD have an associated BC (82%) that was centrally located (61%). In those patients without an associated mass, a significant number (26% in this series) may not have an underlying BC and may be overtreated with mastectomy. On the other hand, a significant number of patients with PD and no associated breast mass will be found to have a peripherally located tumor (29% in this series). These non-central BC masses could potentially be missed by a wide local excision that includes the areolar complex.",

Efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody as a single agent was evaluated in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease.",
        "Methods": "Two hundred twenty-two women, with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after one or two chemotherapy regimens, were enrolled. Patients received a loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously, followed by a 2-mg/kg maintenance dose at weekly intervals.",
        "Results/Findings": "Study patients had advanced metastatic disease and had received extensive prior therapy. A blinded, independent response evaluation committee identified eight complete and 26 partial responses, for an objective response rate of 15% in the intent-to-treat population (95% confidence interval, 11% to 21%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months; the median duration of survival was 13 months. The most common adverse events, which occurred in approximately 40% of patients, were infusion-associated fever and/or chills that usually occurred only during the first infusion, and were of mild to moderate severity. These symptoms were treated successfully with acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine. The most clinically significant adverse event was cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 4.7% of patients. Only 1% of patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related adverse events.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, administered as a single agent, produces durable objective responses and is well tolerated by women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

        "Background/Purpose": "Over the past 40 years, surgical reconstruction of the breast following mastectomy has become an important aspect of the cancer patient's rehabilitation process. While the surgical emphasis remains on a cure for the cancer, experience with breast reconstruction has not demonstrated any increased rate of cancer recurrence, even when reconstruction is performed immediately following tumor resection. Advances in surgical technique and biotechnology have made post-mastectomy reconstruction possible. The development of silicone gel and saline-filled implants as well as tissue expanders has revolutionized breast reconstruction. The elucidation of musculocutaneous flaps now provides the surgeon with the ability to transfer adequate quantities of vascularized tissue to reconstruct the surgical defects. The advent of microsurgical techniques has provided an additional reconstructive option, with free tissue transfer allowing the plastic surgeon to move musculocutaneous flaps from remote or distant sites to reconstruct the defect. The option of having the reconstruction immediately following the mastectomy procedure is now available to the patient. When reviewing the anatomy of the breast region, the surgeon must consider the mammary gland, its vascular supply, and its lymphatic system. The surgical techniques involved in reconstruction after mastectomy include the use of breast implants and tissue expansion, as well as reconstruction with autogenous tissues. Reconstruction with autogenous tissues includes the use of latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap, transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous flap, free flap transfer, as well as nipple-areola reconstruction. Breast reconstruction after mastectomy should be undertaken by a plastic and reconstructive surgeon with considerable training and experience with these diversified procedures.",

For patients with HR(-)/HER2(-) disease, the LRR-free survival rates were 98.6% (pCR) versus 89.9% (no pCR). On multivariate analysis, the HR(-)/HER2(-) subtype, clinical stage III disease, and failure to experience a pCR were associated with LRR.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Our aim was to evaluate the impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease and on the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "The medical records of 125 consecutive patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer referred for FDG PET from January 1998 through May 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. The rationale for FDG PET referral and the impact of FDG PET on subsequent treatment decisions for patients were determined by chart review. The impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease was determined by comparing the FDG PET interpretation at the time of the examination with findings from conventional imaging (CI) performed before FDG PET. FDG PET results were confirmed in nearly half (n = 61) of the patients by histopathology (n = 23) or follow-up imaging (n = 38; mean follow-up interval, 21.3 months).",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients were referred for FDG PET for the following reasons: evaluation of disease response or viability after therapy (n = 43 [35%]), local recurrence, with intent of aggressive local treatment (n = 39 [31%]), equivocal findings on CI (n = 25 [20%]), evaluation of disease extent in patients with known metastases (n = 13 [10%]), and elevated tumor markers with unknown disease site (n = 5 [4%]). Compared with CI findings, the extent of disease increased in 54 (43%), did not change in 41 (33%), and decreased in 30 (24%) of 125 patients using FDG PET. Results of FDG PET altered the therapeutic plan in 40 (32%), directly helped to support the therapeutic plan in 34 (27%), and did not change the plan devised before FDG PET in 51 (41%) of 125 patients. FDG PET altered therapy most frequently in the patients suspected of having locoregional recurrence and in those being evaluated for treatment response versus other referral categories (p = 0.04). For patients with confirmation of FDG PET findings, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG PET were 94%, 91%, and 92%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FDG PET contributes significantly to defining the extent of disease and deciding on treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Osteonecrosis of the jaws is a recently described adverse side effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton who are receiving intravenous, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws; these patients represent 94% of published cases. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. Oversuppression of bone turnover is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this condition, although there may be contributing comorbid factors. All sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. Conservative débridement of necrotic bone, pain control, infection management, use of antimicrobial oral rinses, and withdrawal of bisphosphonates are preferable to aggressive surgical measures for treating this condition. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Oral capecitabine was evaluated in terms of overall response rate, safety, and tolerability as first-line therapy in women aged > or = 55 years with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Ninety-five patients were randomized (2:1) to either intermittent oral capecitabine 1,255 mg/m2 twice daily (two weeks' treatment followed by a one-week rest period) or intravenous CMF (cyclophosphamide. methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) administered every three weeks.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall response rate in the capecitabine group was 30% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 19%-43%), including three complete responses (5%). The response rate observed in the CMF group was 16% (95% CI: 5%-33%), with no complete responses. Median time to disease progression was 4.1 months with capecitabine and 3.0 months with CME. Survival was similar in the two treatment groups (median 19.6 months with capecitabine. 17.2 months with CMF). The safety profiles were different for capecitabine and CMF. However, both regimens were generally well tolerated and treatment interruption and/or dose modification was effective in managing toxicities associated with capecitabine. Alopecia and myelosuppression were rare in patients receiving capecitabine while diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome were more common. Treatment interruption and/or individual dose adjustment of capecitabine was required in 34% of patients and was generally effective in managing adverse events. Treatment was stopped owing to toxicity in 16% of patients in the capecitabine arm. The incidence of deaths during or within 28 days of stopping study treatment was 8% and 6% in the capecitabine and CMF arms, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "An oral, twice-daily regimen of capecitabine is effective and well tolerated when used as first-line chemotherapy in older patients (> or = 55 years) with advanced/metastatic breast cancer, and is suitable for outpatient therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Operative techniques for oncoplastic reconstruction combine oncologic extirpation of the tumor with immediate reconstruction of breast shape and symmetry. These techniques are increasingly being used for breast-conservation therapy of centrally located breast carcinomas. The goal of this study was to provide an overview of the various surgical options for oncoplastic treatment of central breast carcinomas.",
        "Methods": "From September of 1998 through January of 2005, 31 women (median age, 61 years) were treated for 32 centrally located breast carcinomas by breast-conserving therapy. There were 27 invasive tumors (median size, 13.5 mm), and five patients had ductal carcinoma in situ (median size, 39.6 mm). One patient received chemotherapy preoperatively for tumor reduction. A total of 11 patients had a positive lymph-node status, and 21 patients had a free sentinel node.",
        "Results/Findings": "The various surgical techniques included a central lumpectomy with direct closure (n = 6), central lumpectomy with inverted T-closure (n = 2), a circumareolar, Benelli-type closure (n = 2), a modified Grisotti-flap closure (n = 9), and a mammaplasty-type closure with an inferiorly based pedicle (n = 13). In 27 patients, a contralateral procedure was undertaken (bilateral carcinoma or symmetrizing mammaplasty). Two patients required a secondary mastectomy because of ductal carcinoma in situ with positive surgical margins in the final histology. They were treated by immediate reconstruction with an implant and a pedicled myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap, respectively. In a median follow-up of 33.8 months, there were no local recurrences in the remaining breast or axilla, but two patients developed distant metastases.",

        "Background/Purpose": "One of the most exciting and talked about new surgical techniques in breast cancer surgery is the sentinel lymph node biopsy. It is an alternative procedure to standard axillary lymph node dissection, which makes possible less invasive surgery and side effects for patients with early breast cancer that wouldn't benefit further from axillary lymph node clearance. Sentinel lymph node biopsy helps to accurately evaluate the status of the axilla and the extent of disease, but also determines appropriate adjuvant treatment and long-term follow-up. However, like all surgical procedures, the sentinel lymph node biopsy is not appropriate for each and every patient.",
        "Methods": "In this article we review the absolute and relative contraindications of the procedure in respect to clinically positive axilla, neoadjuvant therapy, tumor size, multicentric and multifocal disease, in situ carcinoma, pregnancy, age, body-mass index, allergies to dye and/or radio colloid and prior breast and/or axillary surgery.",
        "Results/Findings": "Certain conditions involving host factors and tumor biologic characteristics may have a negative impact on the success rate and accuracy of the procedure. The overall fraction of patients unsuitable or with multiple risk factors that may compromise the success of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, is very small. Nevertheless, these patients need to be successfully identified, appropriately advised and cautioned, and so do the surgeons that perform the procedure.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "When performed by an experienced multi-disciplinary team, the SLNB is a highly effective and accurate alternative to standard level I and II axillary clearance in the vast majority of patients with early breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Oncoplastic surgery refers to several surgical techniques by which segments of malignant breast tissue are removed to achieve wide surgical margins while the remaining glandular tissue is transposed to achieve the best possible cosmetic outcome. We summarise the general approach to oncoplastic lumpectomy for surgeons who recognise the limitations of standard lumpectomy for large breast cancers, and review different cancer distributions in the breast and their associated imaging characteristics. Full-thickness fibroglandular excision of the mass and surrounding breast tissue allows resection with wide surgical margins. Subsequent breast-flap advancement (mastopexy) results in closure of the resulting surgical defect with good or excellent cosmetic closure. These approaches can improve both the aesthetic outcome of breast cancer resections and the likelihood of surgeons obtaining wide surgical margins in preparation for breast-conserving radiotherapy. Advanced volume-displacement techniques, which are based on the key principles of breast reductive surgery, can greatly increase the options for breast conservation in complex cancer cases.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Oncoplastic surgery for breast cancer is a novel concept that combines a plastic surgical procedure with breast-conserving treatment to improve the final cosmetic results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncological safety of oncoplastic procedures by studying the status of the surgical margins of the excised tumor specimen in comparison with standard quadrantectomies.",
        "Methods": "Thirty consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing oncoplastic surgery (group 1) and 30 patients undergoing standard quadrantectomy (group 2) were prospectively studied with regard to the stage of breast cancer, the surgical procedures performed, the volume of breast tissue excised, and the histopathology of the tumor specimen, with specific details on surgical margins.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients who underwent oncoplastic surgery (group 1) were younger (mean age, 48.73 years) than patients who had a classic quadrantectomy (group 2; mean age, 55.76 years; P = .022). The mean volume of the excised specimen in group 1 was 200.18 cm(3), compared with 117.55 cm(3) in group 2 (P = .016). Surgical margins were negative in 25 cases out of 30 in group 1 and 17 out of 30 in group 2 (P = .05). The average length of the surgical margin was 8.5 mm in group 1 and 6.5 mm in group 2, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .074).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Oncoplastic surgery adds to the oncological safety of breast-conserving treatment because a larger volume of breast tissue can be excised and a wider negative margin can be obtained. It is especially indicated for large tumors, for which standard breast-conserving treatment has a high probability of leaving positive margins.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Oncoplastic surgery (OPS) has emerged as a new approach for extending breast conserving surgery (BCS) possibilities, reducing both mastectomy and re-excision rates, while avoiding breast deformities. OPS is based upon the integration of plastic surgery techniques for immediate reshaping after wide excision for breast cancer. A simple guide for choosing the appropriate OPS procedure is not available.",
        "Methods": "To develop an Atlas and guideline for oncoplastic surgery (OPS) to help in patient selection and choice of optimal surgical procedure for breast cancer patients undergoing BCS.",
        "Results/Findings": "We stratify OPS into two levels based on excision volume and the complexity of the reshaping technique. For resections less than 20% of the breast volume (level I OPS), a step-by-step approach allows easy reshaping of the breast. For larger resections (level II OPS), a mammoplasty technique is required.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We identified three elements that can be used for patient selection and for determination of the appropriate OPS technique: excision volume, tumor location, and glandular density. For level II techniques, we defined a quadrant per quadrant Atlas that offers a different mammoplasty for each quadrant of the breast.",

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may identify the site of primary breast carcinoma and effect management of these patients. We report on eight consecutive women evaluated in our multidisciplinary clinic who had biopsy-proven metastatic adenocarcinomas to axillary lymph nodes and occult primary carcinomas. Each patient underwent MRI at 1.5 T with a volumetric fast-spoiled gradient-echo (3D FSPGR) pulse sequence before and after injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Wire localization of suspicious areas of enhancement was performed under MRI or mammography guidance followed by surgical excision. Seven (88%) of the eight normal mammograms showed dense (>50%) breast parenchyma. In two (25%) of the eight patients, suspicious focal or regional enhancement was seen on MRI. Following wire localization and excision, pathologic exam showed an invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ with invasion corresponding to the MRI enhancement in the two cases. Breast MRI can identify the primary tumor site and influence management of patients presenting with clinically and mammographically occult primary breast carcinomas.",

Of the women with positive MRI who had breast surgery, 21 of 22 (95%) had tumor within the surgical specimen. Twelve women had negative MRI of the breast. Five of these 12 underwent MRM, of whom 4 had no tumor in the mastectomy specimen. The remaining 7 patients had ALND and whole breast radiation (ALND/XRT) (n = 5), or were observed (n = 2). Overall, 18 of 34 women surgically treated had MRM, while 16 (47%) preserved their breast. Tumor yield for patients having breast surgery was 81%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "MRI of the breast can identify occult breast cancer in many patients and may facilitate breast conservation in select women. Negative breast MRI predicts low tumor yield at mastectomy.",

Here, we report an exploratory follow-up of cancer outcomes from the Supervised Trial of Aerobic versus Resistance Training (START).",
        "Methods": "The START was a Canadian multicenter trial that randomized 242 breast cancer patients between 2003 and 2005 to usual care (n = 82), supervised aerobic (n = 78), or resistance (n = 82) exercise during chemotherapy. The primary end point for this exploratory analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points were overall survival, distant DFS, and recurrence-free interval. The two exercise arms were combined for analysis (n = 160), and selected subgroups were explored.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 89 months, there were 25/160 (15.6%) DFS events in the exercise groups and 18/82 (22.0%) in the control group. Eight-year DFS was 82.7% for the exercise groups compared with 75.6% for the control group (HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-1.24; log-rank, P = 0.21). Slightly stronger effects were observed for overall survival (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.27-1.33; log-rank, P = 0.21), distant DFS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.32-1.19; log-rank, P = 0.15), and recurrence-free interval (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.30-1.11; Gray test, P = 0.095). Subgroup analyses suggested potentially stronger exercise effects on DFS for women who were overweight/obese (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.27-1.27), had stage II/III cancer (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.31-1.20), estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.26-1.29), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.02), received taxane-based chemotherapies (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.19-1.15), and ≥85% of their planned chemotherapy (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-1.01).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This exploratory follow-up of the START provides the first randomized data to suggest that adding exercise to standard chemotherapy may improve breast cancer outcomes. A definitive phase III trial is warranted.",

        "Results/Findings": "Sixty-six patients were randomly assigned, 56 of whom provided a preference (eight dropped out and two had no preference); 18 (32%) preferred gabapentin and 38 (68%) preferred venlafaxine (P = .01). Both agents reduced hot flash scores to a similar extent (66% reduction). Venlafaxine was associated with increased nausea, appetite loss, constipation, and reduced negative mood changes compared with gabapentin, whereas gabapentin was associated with increased dizziness and appetite compared with venlafaxine (all P < .05).",

A total of 13 patients (3.2%; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.4) reported at least one episode of grade 3 neuropathy, and 2 had symptomatic congestive heart failure (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.8), both of whom had normalization of the left ventricular ejection fraction after discontinuation of trastuzumab. A total of 13 patients had significant asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction (3.2%; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.4), as defined by the study, but 11 of these patients were able to resume trastuzumab therapy after a brief interruption.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among women with predominantly stage I HER2-positive breast cancer, treatment with adjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was associated with a risk of early recurrence of about 2%; 6% of patients withdrew from the study because of protocol-specified adverse events.

        "Background/Purpose": "Neratinib, an irreversible tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of HER1, HER2, and HER4, has clinical activity in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 12 months of neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "We did this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 495 centres in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America. Eligible women (aged ≥18 years, or ≥20 years in Japan) had stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer and had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy up to 2 years before randomisation. Inclusion criteria were amended on Feb 25, 2010, to include patients with stage 2-3 HER2-positive breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab therapy up to 1 year previously. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral neratinib 240 mg per day or matching placebo. The randomisation sequence was generated with permuted blocks stratified by hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive [oestrogen or progesterone receptor-positive or both] vs hormone receptor-negative [oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative]), nodal status (0, 1-3, or ≥4), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system. Patients, investigators, and trial sponsors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival, as defined in the original protocol, at 2 years after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, we randomly assigned 2840 women to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). Median follow-up time was 24 months (IQR 20-25) in the neratinib group and 24 months (22-25) in the placebo group. At 2 year follow-up, 70 invasive disease-free survival events had occurred in patients in the neratinib group versus 109 events in those in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·50-0·91; p=0·0091). The 2-year invasive disease-free survival rate was 93·9% (95% CI 92·4-95·2) in the neratinib group and 91·6% (90·0-93·0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in patients in the neratinib group were diarrhoea (grade 3, n=561 [40%] and grade 4, n=1 [<1%] vs grade 3, n=23 [2%] in the placebo group), vomiting (grade 3, n=47 [3%] vs n=5 [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3, n=26 [2%] vs n=2 [<1%]). QT prolongation occurred in 49 (3%) patients given neratinib and 93 (7%) patients given placebo, and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (≥grade 2) in 19 (1%) and 15 (1%) patients, respectively. We recorded serious adverse events in 103 (7%) patients in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) patients in the placebo group. Seven (<1%) deaths (four patients in the neratinib group and three patients in the placebo group) unrelated to disease progression occurred after study drug discontinuation. The causes of death in the neratinib group were unknown (n=2), a second primary brain tumour (n=1), and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=1), and in the placebo group were a brain haemorrhage (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and gastric cancer (n=1). None of the deaths were attributed to study treatment in either group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neratinib for 12 months significantly improved 2-year invasive disease-free survival when given after chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy to women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the improvement in breast cancer outcome is maintained.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) is playing an increasing role in the clinical management of breast cancer (BC) and may improve surgical outcomes for postmenopausal, oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC patients. However, there is currently no consensus on the optimal duration of NHT before surgery. Here, we present the outcomes of the TEAM IIA trial, a multicentre, phase II trial investigating the efficacy of six months of neoadjuvant exemestane in postmenopausal, strong ER-positive (ER+, ⩾50%) BC patients.",
        "Methods": "102 patients (stage T2-T4ac) were included in the study after exclusion of ineligible patients. Primary end-point was clinical response at 3 and 6 months as measured by palpation. Secondary end-point was radiological response as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography and/or ultrasound. Linear mixed models (95% confidence interval (CI)) were used to compare changes in mean tumour size (in mm) between baseline, 3 and 6 months after the start of endocrine therapy. Conversion rates from mastectomy to breast conserving surgery (BCS) were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median age of all patients was 72 years (range 53-88). Overall response rate by clinical palpation was 64.5% in all patients with a final palpation measurement. Four patients had clinically progressive disease. 63 patients had both 3-month and >3-month palpation measurements. Overall response was 58.7% at 3 months and 68.3% at final palpation (>3 months). Mean tumour size by clinical palpation at T=0 was 39.1mm (95% CI 34.8-43.4mm), and decreased to 23.0mm (95% CI 18.7-27.2mm) and 16.7 mm (95% CI 12.6-20.8) at T=3 and T>3 months, respectively (p=0.001). Final radiological response rates at the end of treatment for MRI (n=37), ultrasound (n=77) and mammography (n=56) were 70.3%, 41.6% and 48.2%, respectively. Feasibility of BCS improved from 61.8% to 70.6% (McNemar p=0.012).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "6 months of neoadjuvant exemestane therapy helps reduce mean tumour size further in strongly ER-positive BC patients without significant side-effects compared to 3 months. Nevertheless, some patients still experience disease progression under exemestane. Feasibility of breast conservation rates improved by almost 10%.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials have consistently reported lower response rates in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer when compared with HR- cases. Preoperative endocrine therapy has therefore become a logical alternative and has gained considerable momentum from the finding that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than tamoxifen for HR+ breast cancer in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The most convincing neoadjuvant trial to demonstrate the superiority of an AI versus tamoxifen was the P024 study, a large multinational double-blind trial in postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer ineligible for breast-conserving surgery. The overall response rate (ORR) was 55% for letrozole and 36% for tamoxifen (P<0.001). Significantly more letrozole-treated patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (45 vs. 35%, respectively; P=0.022). In addition, ORR was significantly higher with letrozole than tamoxifen in the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER1/HER2+ subgroup (P=0.0004). The clinical efficacy of letrozole in HER2+ breast cancer was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis and was found to be comparable to that of HER2- cases (ORR 71% in both subsets). Biomarker studies confirmed the superiority of letrozole in centrally assessed estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors and found a strong relationship with the degree of ER positivity for both agents. Interestingly, letrozole was effective even in marginally ER+ tumors and, unlike tamoxifen, consistently reduced the expression from estrogen-regulated genes (progesterone receptor and trefoil factor 1). Furthermore, when analyzed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry, letrozole was significantly more effective than tamoxifen in reducing tumor proliferation (P=0.0009). Thus, neoadjuvant letrozole is safe and superior to tamoxifen in the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ locally advanced breast cancer.",

        "Results/Findings": "Of 354,204 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 59,063 (16.7%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This proportion steadily increased from 13.9% in 2006 to 20.5% in 2011 (p<0.001). Receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with larger tumor size (7% cT1, 25% cT2, and 58% cT3; p<0.001), more advanced nodal disease (11% cN0, 39% cN1-3; p<0.001), younger patient age (21%<50 years vs 14%>50 years; p<0.001), higher tumor grade (18% grade 3, 15% grade 2, vs 12% grade 1; p<0.001), and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (21% ER negative vs 15% ER postive; p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that when adjusted for the above variables, patients with tumors larger than 3 cm undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to receive breast preservation than those who opted for primary surgery (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 1.8).",

DFS conditional on being event free for 5 years also demonstrated a strong trend in favor of the preoperative group (HR = 0.81, P = .053). Protocol B-27 results demonstrated that the addition of T to AC did not significantly impact DFS or OS. Preoperative T added to AC significantly increased the proportion of patients having pathologic complete responses (pCRs) compared with preoperative AC alone (26% v 13%, respectively; P < .0001). In both studies, patients who achieved a pCR continue to have significantly superior DFS and OS outcomes compared with patients who did not.",

        "Methods": "In a randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared alpelisib (at a dose of 300 mg per day) plus fulvestrant (at a dose of 500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue   mutation status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, in the cohort with  -mutated cancer; progression-free survival was also analyzed in the cohort without  -mutated cancer. Secondary end points included overall response and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 572 patients underwent randomization, including 341 patients with confirmed tumor-tissue   mutations. In the cohort of patients with  -mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5 to 14.5) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.85; P<0.001); in the cohort without  -mutated cancer, the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.25; posterior probability of hazard ratio <1.00, 79.4%). Overall response among all the patients in the cohort without  -mutated cancer was greater with alpelisib-fulvestrant than with placebo-fulvestrant (26.6% vs. 12.8%); among patients with measurable disease in this cohort, the percentages were 35.7% and 16.2%, respectively. In the overall population, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hyperglycemia (36.6% in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group vs. 0.7% in the placebo-fulvestrant group) and rash (9.9% vs. 0.3%). Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7% of patients in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3% of those in the placebo-fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported. The percentages of patients who discontinued alpelisib and placebo owing to adverse events were 25.0% and 4.2%, respectively.",

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients undergoing a repeat operation or further mastectomy within 6 months of random assignment, or a pathologically avoidable mastectomy at initial operation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, ISRCTN number 57474502.",
        "Results/Findings": "816 patients were randomly assigned to MRI and 807 to no MRI. Addition of MRI to conventional triple assessment was not significantly associated with reduced a reoperation rate, with 153 (19%) needing reoperation in the MRI group versus 156 (19%) in the no MRI group, (odds ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.75-1.24; p=0.77).",

The MA.17 trial, which was designed to determine whether extended adjuvant therapy with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole after tamoxifen reduces the risk of such late recurrences, was stopped early after an interim analysis showed that letrozole improved disease-free survival. This report presents updated findings from the trial.",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women completing 5 years of tamoxifen treatment were randomly assigned to a planned 5 years of letrozole (n = 2593) or placebo (n = 2594). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, incidence of contralateral tumors, and toxic effects. Survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. Planned subgroup analyses included those by axillary lymph node status. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 30 months (range = 1.5-61.4 months), women in the letrozole arm had statistically significantly better DFS and distant DFS than women in the placebo arm (DFS: hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or contralateral breast cancer = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.45 to 0.76; P < .001; distant DFS: HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.84; P = .002). Overall survival was the same in both arms (HR for death from any cause = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.19; P = .3). However, among lymph node-positive patients, overall survival was statistically significantly improved with letrozole (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.98; P = .04). The incidence of contralateral breast cancer was lower in women receiving letrozole, but the difference was not statistically significant. Women receiving letrozole experienced more hormonally related side effects than those receiving placebo, but the incidences of bone fractures and cardiovascular events were the same.",

Our aim was to study the prognosis of basal-like DCIS in a large population-based cohort.",
        "Methods": "All 458 women with a primary DCIS diagnosed between 1986 and 2004, in Uppland and Västmanland, Sweden were included. TMA blocks were constructed. To classify the DCIS tumors, we used immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (estrogen-, progesterone-, HER2, cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor) as a surrogate for the gene expression profiling. The association with prognosis was examined for basal-like DCIS and other subtypes using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression models.",
        "Results/Findings": "IHC data were complete for 392 women. Thirty-two were basal-like (8.2%), 351 were luminal or HER2-positive (89.5%) and 9 unclassified (2.3%). Seventy-six women had a local recurrence of which 34 were invasive. Another 3 women had general metastases as first event. Basal-like DCIS showed a higher risk of local recurrence and invasive recurrence 1.8 (Confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.8-4.2) and 1.9 (0.7-5.1), respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Also, no statistically significant increased risk was seen for triple-negative or high grade DCIS.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Basal-like DCIS showed about a doubled, however not statistically significant risk for local recurrence and developing invasive cancer compared with the other molecular subtypes.

        "Methods": "The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center SLN biopsy database showed that 7,315 SLN biopsy procedures were performed for primary breast cancer from September 1996 to July 2005. Of these, 78 (1.0%) procedures were performed in men. Followup data were obtained from medical record review.",
        "Results/Findings": "SLN biopsy was successful in 76 of 78 (97%) patients. Negative SLNs were found in 39 of 76 (51%) patients. In 3 (8%) patients with negative SLNs, a positive non-SLN was found, identified by intraoperative palpation. Positive SLNs were found in 37 of 76 (49%) patients. In 22 of 37 (59%), node positivity was determined intraoperatively, prompting immediate ALND. In 15 of 37 (41%) patients with positive SLNs, node positivity was determined postoperatively. Of these 15, 9 (60%) underwent completion ALND. In the 2 of 78 (3%) patients with failed SLN biopsy procedures, ALND was performed and yielded positive nodes. At a median followup of 28 months (range 5 to 96 months), there were no axillary recurrences. Compared with their female counterparts, men with breast cancer had larger tumors and were more likely to have positive nodes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SLN biopsy is successful and accurate in male breast cancer patients. Although a larger proportion of men have positive nodes, for men with negative nodes, SLN biopsy may reduce morbidity related to ALND.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Mastectomy is considered as the standard therapy for gestational breast cancer. Since radiation therapy is harmful for the fetus, conservative surgery is rarely used during pregnancy. Among 16 patients with gestational breast cancer, 10 and 6 were treated with conservative surgery and mastectomy, respectively. No local recurrences occurred with a median follow-up time of 87 months. Among the 10 patients treated with conservative surgery, 3 chose therapeutic abortion and 7 opted to continue their pregnancy. Concerning these 7 fetuses, there were no congenital anomalies, nor growth restriction. All children were normal physically and neurologically. We concluded that conservative breast surgery may be an alternative to mastectomy in the treatment of gestational breast cancer and is safe for the fetus.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Many patients with HR+, HER2- early breast cancer (EBC) will not experience recurrence or have distant recurrence with currently available standard therapies. However, up to 30% of patients with high-risk clinical and/or pathologic features may experience distant recurrence, many in the first few years. Superior treatment options are needed to prevent early recurrence and development of metastases for this group of patients. Abemaciclib is an oral, continuously dosed, CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC). Efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in ABC supported evaluation in the adjuvant setting.",
        "Methods": "This open-label, phase III study included patients with HR+, HER2-, high-risk EBC, who had surgery and, as indicated, radiotherapy and/or adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with four or more positive nodes, or one to three nodes and either tumor size ≥ 5 cm, histologic grade 3, or central Ki-67 ≥ 20%, were eligible and randomly assigned (1:1) to standard-of-care adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) with or without abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily for 2 years). The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and secondary end points included distant relapse-free survival, overall survival, and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a preplanned efficacy interim analysis, among 5,637 randomly assigned patients, 323 IDFS events were observed in the intent-to-treat population. Abemaciclib plus ET demonstrated superior IDFS versus ET alone (  = .01; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.93), with 2-year IDFS rates of 92.2% versus 88.7%, respectively. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of abemaciclib.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Abemaciclib when combined with ET is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to demonstrate a significant improvement in IDFS in patients with HR+, HER2- node-positive EBC at high risk of early recurrence.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Many active cytotoxic agents exist for breast cancer therapy, and numerous combination chemotherapy regimens are derived from them. Creating these combinations is sometimes empirically motivated by non-overlapping toxicities or the expectation of non-cross resistance. Yet, there is usually no absolute division of these aspects among cytotoxic agents, and the median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer has not been dramatically prolonged by this approach. When the outcome of treatment is palliation rather than cure, it becomes paramount to optimize the dynamic equilibrium between chemotherapy-induced side effects and the benefits attributable to relief of cancer-related symptoms. To this end, several recent clinical trials have evaluated the novel nucleoside analog gemcitabine (Gemzar) as single-agent therapy for advanced breast cancer. This article reviews these trials.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy, and gender-specific treatment outcomes are currently lacking. The use of a large, multi-national surgical-outcomes database may provide a better understanding of treatment patterns and postoperative morbidity in men who undergo oncological breast surgery.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between 2007 and 2016 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (NSQIP), examining MBC treatment patterns and postoperative complication rates. All men undergoing surgery for the treatment of invasive or in situ carcinoma of the breast were identified. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and surgical treatment options most frequently used for this population were described. In addition, the 30-day postoperative complication rates in the surgical treatment of male breast cancer were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1773 MBC patients with a median age of 65 years (IQR 56-74 years) were included in this analysis. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.1 (IQR 25.4-33.8). In this study population, 177 (10.0%) had a diagnosis of in situ breast cancer, while the remaining 1596 (90.0%) had invasive disease. While most men underwent mastectomy, 282 (15.9%) had breast-conserving surgery. There were 74 (4.2%) patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In addition, 118 (6.7%) patients elected to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Overall, the rate of morbidity was 4.6%, comprising mostly of wound complications (3.2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Analysis of this large, prospective multi-institutional cohort revealed that complication rates are low and comparable to reported rates in the female breast cancer population. What is also significant about this analysis is that the cohort demonstrated the importance of cosmetic considerations in MBC patients, as some men decide to undergo breast-conserving surgery or immediate breast reconstruction. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in the treatment of MBC is also performed.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and lacks data-based treatment guidelines. Most men are currently treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or simple mastectomy (SM). We compared the oncologic treatment outcomes of early-stage MBC to determine whether breast conservation therapy (BCT) is appropriate.",
        "Methods": "We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for MBC cases. That cohort was narrowed to cases of stage I-II, T1-T2N0 MBC with surgical and radiation therapy (RT) data available. The patients had undergone MRM, SM, or breast conservation surgery (BCS) with or without postoperative RT. We calculated the actuarial 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS).",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 6263 MBC cases and included 1777 men with stage I or II, T1-T2, node-negative disease, who had the required treatment information available. MRM without RT was the most common treatment (43%). Only 17% underwent BCS. Of the BCS patients, 46% received adjuvant RT to complete the traditional BCT. No deaths were recorded in the BCT group, regardless of stage, or in the 3 stage I surgical groups if the men had received RT. The actuarial 5-year CSS was 100% in each BCT group. MRM alone resulted in an actuarial 5-year CSS of 97.3% for stage 1% and 91.2% for stage 2.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results from our study suggest that BCT for early-stage MBC yields comparable survival compared with more invasive treatment modalities (ie, MRM or SM alone). This could shift the treatment paradigm to less-invasive interventions and might have the added benefit of increased functional and psychological outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our conclusions.",

BC-specific-mortality was higher for men younger than 50 years. Better overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were observed for highly ER+ (P = 0.001), highly PR+ (P = 0.002), highly AR+ disease (P = 0.019).

In all patients, the total activity excreted within the first 16 h was <2% of the injected activity. Activity in the blood pool was, at each time point, <1% of the injected activity. In 23 of 26 patients, all absorbed dose measurements were lower than the sensitivity of the TLD (<10 microGy); in the remaining three patients, the absorbed doses at the level of epigastrium, umbilicus and hypogastrium were in the following ranges: 40-320, 120-250 and 30-140 microGy, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "According to our standard technique (12 MBq of 99mTc-HAS), LS and SLNB can be performed safely during pregnancy, since the very low prenatal doses from this diagnostic procedure, when properly performed, do not significantly increase the risk of prenatal death, malformation or mental impairment.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In the United States, the populations primarily affected by lymphedema are patients undergoing treatment of malignancy, particularly women treated for breast cancer. A thorough evaluation of patients presenting with extremity swelling should include identification of prior surgical or radiation therapy for malignancy, as well as documentation of other risk factors for lymphedema, such as prior trauma to or infection of the affected limb. Physical examination should focus on differentiating signs of lymphedema from other causes of systemic or localized swelling. Lymphatic dysfunction can be visualized through lymphoscintigraphy; the diagnosis of lymphedema can also be confirmed through other imaging modalities, including CT or MRI. The mainstay of therapy in diagnosed cases of lymphedema involves compression garment use, as well as intensive bandaging and lymphatic massage. For patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy, several surgical options with varied proven efficacies have been used in appropriate candidates, including excisional approaches, microsurgical lymphatic anastomoses, and circumferential suction-assisted lipectomy, an approach that has shown promise for long-term relief of symptoms.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Local cancer relapse risk after breast conservation surgery followed by radiotherapy has fallen sharply in many countries, and is influenced by patient age and clinicopathological factors. We hypothesise that partial-breast radiotherapy restricted to the vicinity of the original tumour in women at lower than average risk of local relapse will improve the balance of beneficial versus adverse effects compared with whole-breast radiotherapy.",
        "Methods": "IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done in 30 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Women aged 50 years or older who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for unifocal invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of grade 1-3, with a tumour size of 3 cm or less (pT1-2), none to three positive axillary nodes (pN0-1), and minimum microscopic margins of non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy and 40 Gy to the partial breast (reduced-dose group), or 40 Gy to the partial breast only (partial-breast group) in 15 daily treatment fractions. Computer-generated random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were used to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by radiotherapy treatment centre. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. Field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered using standard tangential beams that were simply reduced in length for the partial-breast group. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local relapse (80% power to exclude a 2·5% increase [non-inferiority margin] at 5 years for each experimental group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the local relapse hazard ratio [HR] was less than 2·03), analysed by intention to treat. Safety analyses were done in all patients for whom data was available (ie, a modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN12852634.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 women were recruited. Two women withdrew consent for use of their data in the analysis. 674 patients were analysed in the whole-breast radiotherapy (control) group, 673 in the reduced-dose group, and 669 in the partial-breast group. Median follow-up was 72·2 months (IQR 61·7-83·2), and 5-year estimates of local relapse cumulative incidence were 1·1% (95% CI 0·5-2·3) of patients in the control group, 0·2% (0·02-1·2) in the reduced-dose group, and 0·5% (0·2-1·4) in the partial-breast group. Estimated 5-year absolute differences in local relapse compared with the control group were -0·73% (-0·99 to 0·22) for the reduced-dose and -0·38% (-0·84 to 0·90) for the partial-breast groups. Non-inferiority can be claimed for both reduced-dose and partial-breast radiotherapy, and was confirmed by the test against the critical HR being more than 2·03 (p=0·003 for the reduced-dose group and p=0·016 for the partial-breast group, compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy group). Photographic, patient, and clinical assessments recorded similar adverse effects after reduced-dose or partial-breast radiotherapy, including two patient domains achieving statistically significantly lower adverse effects (change in breast appearance [p=0·007 for partial-breast] and breast harder or firmer [p=0·002 for reduced-dose and p<0·0001 for partial-breast]) compared with whole-breast radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We showed non-inferiority of partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy compared with the standard whole-breast radiotherapy in terms of local relapse in a cohort of patients with early breast cancer, and equivalent or fewer late normal-tissue adverse effects were seen. This simple radiotherapy technique is implementable in radiotherapy centres worldwide.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Little information exists on the incidence of complications after acellular human dermis implantation in two-stage tissue expander breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative adverse events and identify significant predictors of complications in acellular human dermis tissue expander breast reconstruction.",
        "Methods": "This study accrued all patients from January of 2004 through April of 2008 undergoing two-stage immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction using acellular human dermis. A total of 153 expanders were placed. Complications were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling was performed. Comparison of complication rates using the traditional (non-acellular human dermis) technique from concurrent (2004 to 2008) and consecutive time periods (2001 to 2003) for 2910 and 1170 expanders, respectively, is provided.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 153 expanders were implanted in 96 women: 39 unilateral and 57 bilateral. Eleven (7.2 percent) were removed due to infection (n = 5, 3.3 percent), exposure (n = 4, 2.6 percent), or patient preference (n = 2, 1.3 percent). Other complications included cellulitis (3.9 percent), seroma (7.2 percent), hematoma (2.0 percent), mastectomy flap necrosis (4.6 percent), and leak/failed expansion (0.0 percent); 92.8 percent were successfully expanded and exchanged for a permanent implant. Eleven seromas (7.2 percent) were identified; nine underwent aspiration. None of these resulted in infection or reconstructive failure. Univariate analysis revealed age, body mass index, axillary dissection, and postoperative chemotherapy to be associated with reconstructive failure (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that age, body mass index, and axillary dissection are independent risk factors for developing complications (p < 0.05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Acellular human dermis is a useful adjunct for intraoperative pocket development in immediate tissue expander reconstruction but can result in an increased risk of complications, in particular, seroma and reconstructive failure.",

        "Methods": "We analysed postmenopausal women with localised invasive breast cancer. The primary endpoint disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints time to recurrence (TTR), incidence of new contralateral breast cancer (CLBC), time to distant recurrence (TTDR), overall survival (OS), and death after recurrence were assessed in the total population (intention to treat; ITT: anastrozole, n=3125; tamoxifen, n=3116; total 6241) and the hormone-receptor-positive subpopulation, the clinically important subgroup for which endocrine treatment is now known to be effective (84% of ITT: anastrozole, n=2618; tamoxifen, n=2598; total 5216). After treatment completion, fractures and serious adverse events continued to be collected blindly (safety population: anastrozole, n=3092; tamoxifen, n=3094; total 6186). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN18233230.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 100 months (range 0-126), DFS, TTR, TTDR, and CLBC were improved significantly in the ITT and hormone-receptor-positive populations. For hormone-receptor-positive patients: DFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.94), p=0.003; TTR HR 0.76 (0.67-0.87), p=0.0001; TTDR HR 0.84 (0.72-0.97), p=0.022; and CLBC HR 0.60 (0.42-0.85), p=0.004. Absolute differences in time to recurrence increased over time (TTR 2.8% [anastrozole 9.7%vs tamoxifen 12.5%] at 5 years and 4.8% [anastrozole 17.0%vs tamoxifen 21.8%] at 9 years) and recurrence rates remained significantly lower on anastrozole compared with tamoxifen after treatment completion (HR 0.75 [0.61-0.94], p=0.01). The fewer deaths after recurrence (anastrozole 245 vs tamoxifen 269) was not significant (HR 0.90 [0.75-1.07], p=0.2), and no effect was noted for OS (anastrozole 472 vs tamoxifen 477) HR 0.97 [0.86-1.11], p=0.7). Fracture rates were higher in patients receiving anastrozole than in those receiving tamoxifen during active treatment (number [annual rate]: 375 [2.93%] vs 234 [1.90%]; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.55 [1.31-1.83], p<0.0001), but were not different after treatment was completed (off treatment: 146 [1.56%] vs 143 [1.51%]; IRR 1.03 [0.81-1.31], p=0.79). We did not note any significant difference in risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality between anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data show long-term safety findings and establish clearly the long-term efficacy of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen as initial adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive, early breast cancer, and provide statistically significant evidence of a larger carryover effect after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen.",

In responders, the median response duration was 10.4 months. In 20 patients (41%), stable disease was the best outcome. Median time to progression was 2.2 months (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2 months); median survival was 7.9 months.

        "Background/Purpose": "It was previously shown that letrozole (Femara) was significantly more potent than anastrozole (Arimidex) in inhibiting aromatase activity in vitro and in inhibiting total body aromatisation in patients with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to compare letrozole (2.5 mg per day) and anastrozole (1 mg per day) as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with an anti-oestrogen. This randomised, multicentre and multinational open-label phase IIIb/IV study enrolled 713 patients. Treatment was for advanced breast cancer that had progressed either during anti-oestrogen therapy or within 12 months of completing that therapy. Patients had tumours that were either positive for oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors (48%) or of unknown receptor status (52%). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints included objective response, duration of response, rate and duration of overall clinical benefit (responses and long-term stable disease), time to treatment failure, and overall survival, as well as general safety. There was no difference between the treatment arms in TTP; median times were the same for both treatments. Letrozole was significantly superior to anastrozole in the overall response rate (ORR) (19.1% versus 12.3%, P=0.013), including in predefined subgroups (receptor status-unknown, and soft-tissue- and viscera-dominant site of disease). There were no significant differences between the treatment arms in the rate of clinical benefit, median duration of response, duration of clinical benefit, time to treatment failure or overall survival. Both agents were well tolerated and there were no significant differences in safety. These results support previous data documenting the greater aromatase-inhibiting activity of letrozole and indicate that advanced breast cancer is more responsive to letrozole than to anastrozole as second-line endocrine therapy.",

In the NSABP B-24 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (accrual period: May 9, 1991, to April 13, 1994), all accrued patients were randomly assigned to LRT+ placebo, (n=900) or LRT + tamoxifen (LRT + TAM, n = 899). Endpoints included I-IBTR, DCIS-IBTR, contralateral breast cancers (CBC), overall and breast cancer-specific survival, and survival after I-IBTR. Median follow-up was 207 months for the B-17 trial (N = 813 patients) and 163 months for the B-24 trial (N = 1799 patients).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 490 IBTR events, 263 (53.7%) were invasive. Radiation reduced I-IBTR by 52% in the LRT group compared with LO (B-17, hazard ratio [HR] of risk of I-IBTR = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33 to 0.69, P < .001). LRT + TAM reduced I-IBTR by 32% compared with LRT + placebo (B-24, HR of risk of I-IBTR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.95, P = .025). The 15-year cumulative incidence of I-IBTR was 19.4% for LO, 8.9% for LRT (B-17), 10.0% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 8.5% for LRT + TAM. The 15-year cumulative incidence of all contralateral breast cancers was 10.3% for LO, 10.2% for LRT (B-17), 10.8% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 7.3% for LRT + TAM. I-IBTR was associated with increased mortality risk (HR of death = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.96, P < .001), whereas recurrence of DCIS was not. Twenty-two of 39 deaths after I-IBTR were attributed to breast cancer. Among all patients (with or without I-IBTR), the 15-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer death was 3.1% for LO, 4.7% for LRT (B-17), 2.7% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 2.3% for LRT + TAM.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although I-IBTR increased the risk for breast cancer-related death, radiation therapy and tamoxifen reduced I-IBTR, and long-term prognosis remained excellent after breast-conserving surgery for DCIS.",

This brings into question the necessity of complete axillary lymph node dissection (CALND) versus a second SLNB (remapping). Our objective is to determine the feasibility of a reoperative SLNB.",
        "Methods": "A review of patients receiving a reoperative SLNB between April 1994 and December 2006 was conducted with IRB approval. Fifty-six patients underwent a second SLNB on the ipsilateral side an average of 42.5 months after their first SLNB.",
        "Results/Findings": "Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully remapped in 45 of 56 (80.4%) patients. Of 45 patients successfully remapped, 36 (80%) were node negative and were spared CALND.

        "Background/Purpose": "Invasive breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cancer of young women. Considering the trend toward postponing childbearing until the later reproductive years, the number of childless women at diagnosis of BC will continue to increase. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine have recommended that the impact of cancer treatments on fertility should be addressed with all cancer patients of reproductive age and that options for fertility preservation, such as cryopreservation of embryos and oocytes, ovarian tissue, in vitro maturation of immature oocytes, and ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, should be discussed routinely. To optimally counsel patients on how to best weigh the risks and benefits of fertility preservation, both the health care provider and the patient must know about the options, their risks, and their likelihood of success. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on fertility preservation options for young BC patients, surrogates of ovarian function, psychosocial aspects of infertility after cancer treatment, women's attitudes towards childbearing after cancer treatment, and health care providers' attitudes towards fertility preservation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Interest in the use of preoperative systemic treatment in the management of breast cancer has increased because such neoadjuvant therapy appears to reduce the extent of local surgery required. We compared the clinical end points of patients with breast cancer treated preoperatively with systemic therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) and of those treated postoperatively with the same regimen (adjuvant therapy) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials.",
        "Methods": "We evaluated nine randomized studies, including a total of 3946 patients with breast cancer, that compared neoadjuvant therapy with adjuvant therapy regardless of what additional surgery and/or radiation treatment was used. Fixed and random effects methods were used to combine data. Primary outcomes were death, disease progression, distant disease recurrence, and loco-regional disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were local response and conservative local treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "We found no statistically or clinically significant difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy arms associated with death (summary risk ratio [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.12), disease progression (summary RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.07), or distant disease recurrence (summary RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.06). However, neoadjuvant therapy was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of loco-regional disease recurrences (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.43), compared with adjuvant therapy, especially in trials where more patients in the neoadjuvant, than the adjuvant, arm received radiation therapy without surgery (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.10). Across trials, we observed heterogeneity in the rates of complete clinical response (range = 7%-65%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), pathologic response (range = 4%-29%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), and adoption of conservative local treatment (range = 28%-89% in neoadjuvant arms, P for heterogeneity of <.001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neoadjuvant therapy was apparently equivalent to adjuvant therapy in terms of survival and overall disease progression. Neoadjuvant therapy, compared with adjuvant therapy, was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of loco-regional recurrence when radiotherapy without surgery was adopted.",

Here, we report long-term results of this trial.",
        "Methods": "Women with completely locally excised DCIS were recruited into a randomised 2×2 factorial trial of radiotherapy, tamoxifen, or both. Randomisation was independently done for each of the two treatments (radiotherapy and tamoxifen), stratified by screening assessment centre, and blocked in groups of four. The recommended dose for radiation was 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (2 Gy per day on weekdays), and tamoxifen was prescribed at a dose of 20 mg daily for 5 years. Elective decision to withhold or provide one of the treatments was permitted. The endpoints of primary interest were invasive ipsilateral new breast events for the radiotherapy comparison and any new breast event, including contralateral disease and DCIS, for tamoxifen. Analysis of each of the two treatment comparisons was restricted to patients who were randomly assigned to that treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat. All trial drugs have been completed and this study is in long-term follow-up. This study is registered, number ISRCTN99513870.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May, 1990, and August, 1998, 1701 women were randomly assigned to radiotherapy and tamoxifen, radiotherapy alone, tamoxifen alone, or to no adjuvant treatment. Seven patients had protocol violations and thus 1694 patients were available for analysis. After a median follow-up of 12·7 years (IQR 10·9-14·7), 376 (163 invasive [122 ipsilateral vs 39 contralateral], 197 DCIS [174 ipsilateral vs 17 contralateral], and 16 of unknown invasiveness or laterality) breast cancers were diagnosed. Radiotherapy reduced the incidence of all new breast events (hazard ratio [HR] 0·41, 95% CI 0·30-0·56; p<0·0001), reducing the incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease (0·32, 0·19-0·56; p<0·0001) as well as ipsilateral DCIS (0·38, 0·22-0·63; p<0·0001), but having no effect on contralateral breast cancer (0·84, 0·45-1·58; p=0·6). Tamoxifen reduced the incidence of all new breast events (HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·58-0·88; p=0·002), reducing recurrent ipsilateral DCIS (0·70, 0·51-0·86; p=0·03) and contralateral tumours (0·44, 0·25-0·77; p=0·005), but having no effect on ipsilateral invasive disease (0·95, 0·66-1·38; p=0·8). No data on adverse events except cause of death were collected for this trial.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This updated analysis confirms the long-term beneficial effect of radiotherapy and reports a benefit for tamoxifen in reducing local and contralateral new breast events for women with DCIS treated by complete local excision.",

Estimates of the net benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared by age, race, and categories of predicted breast cancer risk. Statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "After 7 years of follow-up, the cumulative rate of invasive breast cancer was reduced from 42.5 per 1000 women in the placebo group to 24.8 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.70) and the cumulative rate of noninvasive breast cancer was reduced from 15.8 per 1000 women in the placebo group to 10.2 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.89). These reductions were similar to those seen in the initial report. Tamoxifen led to a 32% reduction in osteoporotic fractures (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.92). Relative risks of stroke, deep-vein thrombosis, and cataracts (which increased with tamoxifen) and of ischemic heart disease and death (which were not changed with tamoxifen) were also similar to those initially reported. Risks of pulmonary embolism were approximately 11% lower than in the original report, and risks of endometrial cancer were about 29% higher, but these differences were not statistically significant. The net benefit achieved with tamoxifen varied according to age, race, and level of breast cancer risk.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Despite the potential bias caused by the unblinding of the P-1 trial, the magnitudes of all beneficial and undesirable treatment effects of tamoxifen were similar to those initially reported, with notable reductions in breast cancer and increased risks of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer. Readily identifiable subsets of individuals comprising 2.5 million women could derive a net benefit from the drug.",

We compared changes in incidence rates over 3-year intervals by breast cancer subtype and race using SEER*Stat. Survival differences by breast cancer subtype and race were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank statistics. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between 1988 and 1990 and 1997 and 1999, IBC incidence rates (per 100,000 woman-years) increased from 2.0 to 2.5 (P < .001), whereas those for LABC declined (2.5 to 2.0, P = .0025), as did those for non-T4 breast cancer (108 to 101, P = .0084). IBC incidence rates were statistically significantly higher in black women (3.1) than in white women (2.2) during the study period (P < .001). Women diagnosed with IBC had statistically significantly poorer survival than women with either LABC or non-T4 breast cancer (log-rank test, P < .001). Median survival of women with IBC (2.9 years) was statistically significantly shorter than that of women with LABC (6.4 years; P < .0001) or non-T4 breast cancer (> 10 years, P < .0001).

        "Results/Findings": "Gene expression analyses indicated that IBC has higher expression of genes associated with increased metabolic rate, lipid signaling, and cell turnover relative to non-IBC tumors. Consistent with the expression analysis, IBC had statistically higher Ki-67 (93% versus 11%; P<0.001). BAX expression, reflecting increased apoptosis and cell turnover, was significantly uniformly higher in almost all IBC (98% versus 66%; P<0.05), whereas the expression of Bcl-2 was not significantly different. IBC tumors were more likely to be steroid hormone receptor negative (estrogen receptor, 49% versus 30%; P=0.002; progesterone receptor, 68% versus 42%; P=0.001).

        "Background/Purpose": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of locally advanced breast cancer with high metastatic potential. Most patients have lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis and 1/3 of the patients have distant metastases. In a previous study, we demonstrated that IBC is a distinct form of breast cancer in comparison with non-IBC. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the different molecular subtypes in our data set of 16 IBC and 18 non-IBC specimen. Therefore, we selected an 'intrinsic gene set' of 144 genes, present on our cDNA chips and common to the 'intrinsic gene set' described by Sorlie et al. [PNAS, 2003]. This set of genes was tested for performance in the Norway/Stanford data set by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Expression centroids were then calculated for the core members of each of the five subclasses in the Norway/Stanford data set and used to classify our own specimens by calculating Spearman correlations between each sample and each centroid. We identified the same cell-of-origin subtypes in IBC as those already described in non-IBC. The classification was in good agreement with immunohistochemical data for estrogen receptor protein expression and cytokeratin 5/6 protein expression. Confirmation was done by an alternative unsupervised hierarchical clustering method. The robustness of this classification was assessed by an unsupervised hierarchical clustering with an alternative gene set of 141 genes related to the cell-of-origin subtypes, selected using a discriminating score and iterative random permutation testing. The contribution of the different cell-of-origin subtypes to the IBC phenotype was investigated by principal component analysis. Generally, the combined ErbB2-overexpressing and basal-like cluster was more expressed in IBC compared to non-IBC, whereas the combined luminal A, luminal B and normal-like cluster was more pronounced in non-IBC compared to IBC. The presence of the same molecular cell-of-origin subtypes in IBC as in non-IBC does not exclude the specific molecular nature of IBC, since gene lists that characterize IBC and non-IBC are entirely different from gene lists that define the different cell-of-origin subtypes, as evidenced by principal component analysis.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer associated with overexpression of Her2/Neu (human epidermal growth factor-like receptor 2 (HER2)) and poor survival. We investigated survival differences for IBC patient cases based on hormone receptor status and HER2 receptor status using data from the California Cancer Registry, as contrasted with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and non-T4 breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "A case-only analysis of 80,099 incident female breast cancer patient cases in the California Cancer Registry during 1999 to 2003 was performed, with follow-up through March 2007. Overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BC-SS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards ratios.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 2,014 IBC, 1,268 LABC, 3,059 MBC, and 73,758 non-T4 breast cancer patient cases were identified. HER2+ was associated with advanced tumor stage (P < 0.0001). IBC patient cases were more likely to be HER2+ (40%) and less likely to be hormone receptor-positive (HmR+) (59%) compared with LABC (35% and 69%, respectively), MBC (35% and 74%), and non-T4 patient cases (22% and 82%). HmR+ status was associated with improved OS and BC-SS for each breast cancer subtype after adjustment for clinically relevant factors. In multivariate analysis, HER2+ (versus HER2-) status was associated with poor BC-SS for non-T4 patient cases (hazards ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.28) and had a borderline significant association with improved BC-SS for IBC (hazards ratio = 0.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.68 to 0.99).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Despite an association with advanced tumor stage, HER2+ status is not an independent adverse prognostic factor for survival among IBC patient cases.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer with poorly understood prognostic variables. The purpose of this study was to define the prognostic impact of HER-2 status on survival outcomes of patients with IBC.",
        "Methods": "In all, 179 patients with IBC, diagnosed between 1989 and 2005, with known HER-2 status, and treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen without trastuzumab, were included in the analysis. Patients with HER-2-positive disease who received trastuzumab at the time of disease recurrence were included. Survival outcomes were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and compared across groups using the log-rank statistic. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to determine the association of survival outcomes with HER-2 status after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 111 patients (62%) had HER-2-negative disease and 68 (38%) had HER-2-positive disease. The median follow-up among all patients was 35 months. At the time of the analysis, 62 patients (55.9%) with HER-2-negative disease and 42 patients (61.8%) with HER-2-positive disease had a recurrence. Thirty-one patients (73.8%) with HER-2-positive disease who had a disease recurrence went on to receive trastuzumab. On univariate analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for either recurrence-free survival (P = .75) or overall survival (P = .24) between patients who had HER-2-positive disease and those who had HER-2-negative disease. In a multivariate model, HER-2 status did not appear to significantly affect recurrence-free survival (hazards ratio [HR] of 0.75; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.46-1.22 [P = .241]). In the multivariate model, patients with HER-2-positive disease had a decreased hazard of death (HR of 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.93 [P = .024]) compared with patients with HER-2-negative disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "HER-2 status, in the absence of trastuzumab, did not appear to significantly affect recurrence-free survival. After adjusting for other characteristics, the addition of trastuzumab in the metastatic setting significantly improved survival in the HER-2-positive group above and beyond that of the HER-2-negative group. This gives us further insight into the biology of this aggressive disease and underlines the major effect of targeted intervention.",

It is diagnosed based on clinical signs of a rapidly enlarging, tender, erythematous, edematous breast that often presents without an underlying breast mass.

        "Background/Purpose": "Increased circulating tumor cells (CTCs; five or more CTCs per 7.5 mL of whole blood) are associated with poor prognosis in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A randomized trial of patients with persistent increase in CTCs tested whether changing chemotherapy after one cycle of first-line chemotherapy would improve the primary outcome of overall survival (OS).",
        "Methods": "Patients with MBC who did not have increased CTCs at baseline remained on initial therapy until progression (arm A). Patients with initially increased CTCs that decreased after 21 days of therapy remained on initial therapy (arm B). Patients with persistently increased CTCs after 21 days of therapy were randomly assigned to continue initial therapy (arm C1) or change to an alternative chemotherapy (arm C2).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 595 eligible and evaluable patients, 276 (46%) did not have increased CTCs (arm A). Of those with initially increased CTCs, 31 (10%) were not retested, 165 were assigned to arm B, and 123 were randomly assigned to arm C1 or C2. No difference in median OS was observed between arm C1 and C2 (10.7 and 12.5 months, respectively; P = .98). CTCs were strongly prognostic. Median OS for arms A, B, and C (C1 and C2 combined) were 35 months, 23 months, and 13 months, respectively (P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study confirms the prognostic significance of CTCs in patients with MBC receiving first-line chemotherapy. For patients with persistently increased CTCs after 21 days of first-line chemotherapy, early switching to an alternate cytotoxic therapy was not effective in prolonging OS. For this population, there is a need for more effective treatment than standard chemotherapy.",

Here, we report 5-year progression-free survival, disease-free survival, and safety.",
        "Methods": "In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 randomised trial in hospitals and medical clinics, treatment-naive adults with locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, increasing to 100 mg/m(2) from cycle 2 if tolerated; group A), pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B), pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C), or pertuzumab and docetaxel (group D). After surgery, patients received three cycles of FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks (patients in group C received four cycles of docetaxel prior to FEC), and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks to complete 1 year's treatment (17 cycles in total). Randomisation was done by a central centre using dynamic allocation, stratified by operable, locally advanced, and inflammatory breast cancer, and by oestrogen and/or progesterone receptor positivity. Safety analyses were done according to treatment received. The primary endpoint (pathological complete response) was previously reported; secondary endpoints reported here are 5-year progression-free survival (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and disease-free survival (analysed in patients who had surgery). Secondary and exploratory analyses were not powered for formal statistical hypothesis testing, and therefore results are for descriptive purposes only. The study ended on Sept 22, 2014 (last patient, last visit). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 17, 2007, and Dec 22, 2009, 417 eligible patients were randomly assigned to group A (107 patients), group B (107 patients), group C (107 patients), or group D (96 patients). One patient in group A withdrew before treatment. One patient assigned to group D received group A treatment, one patient assigned to group D received group B treatment, and one patient assigned to group B received group C treatment. At clinical cutoff, 87 patients had progressed or died. 5-year progression-free survival rates were 81% (95% CI 71-87) for group A, 86% (77-91) for group B, 73% (64-81) for group C, and 73% (63-81) for group D (hazard ratios 0·69 [95% CI 0·34-1·40] group B vs group A, 1·25 [0·68-2·30] group C vs group A, and 2·05 [1·07-3·93] group D vs group B). Disease-free survival results were consistent with progression-free survival results and were 81% (95% CI 72-88) for group A, 84% (72-91) for group B, 80% (70-86) for group C, and 75% (64-83) for group D. Patients who achieved total pathological complete response (all groups combined) had longer progression-free survival compared with patients who did not (85% [76-91] in patients who achieved total pathological response vs 76% [71-81] in patients who did not achieve total pathological response; hazard ratio 0·54 [95% CI 0·29-1·00]). There were no new or long-term safety concerns and tolerability was similar across groups (neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment periods combined). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (group A: 71 [66%] of 107 patients; group B: 59 [55%] of 107; group C: 40 [37%] of 108; group D: 60 [64%] of 94), febrile neutropenia (group A: 10 [9%]; group B: 12 [11%]; group C: 5 [5%]; group D: 15 [16%]), and leucopenia (group A: 13 [12%]; group B: 6 [6%]; group C: 4 [4%]; group D: 8 [9%]). The number of patients with one or more serious adverse event was similar across groups (19-22 serious adverse events per group in 18-22% of patients).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Progression-free survival and disease-free survival at 5-year follow-up show large and overlapping CIs, but support the primary endpoint (pathological complete response) and suggest that neoadjuvant pertuzumab is beneficial when combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Additionally, they suggest that total pathological complete response could be an early indicator of long-term outcome in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.",

A Cox proportional hazards model showed node-positive, TN, and QpCR were the significant predictors for DFS and OS among study, age, tumor size, nuclear grade, nodal status, subtype, clinical response, and pathologic response (DFS; node-positive, HR = 2.29, p = 0.001; TN, HR = 3.39, p < 0.001; QpCR, HR = 0.27, p < 0.001: OS; node-positive, HR = 3.05, p = 0.003; TN, HR = 4.92, p < 0.001; QpCR, HR = 0.12, p < 0.001). In a logistic regression analysis, subtype and clinical response before surgery were the significant predictive variables for QpCR (luminal/Her2-positive, odds ratio (OR) = 4.15, p = 0.002; Her2-positive, OR = 6.24, p < 0.001; TN, OR = 4.24, p < 0.001; clinical response before surgery, OR = 2.41, p = 0.019).",

        "Background/Purpose": "In the OlympiAD study, olaparib was shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in patients with a germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAm) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC). We now report the planned final overall survival (OS) results, and describe the most common adverse events (AEs) to better understand olaparib tolerability in this population.",
        "Methods": "OlympiAD, a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label study ( ), enrolled patients with a germline BRCAm and HER2-negative mBC who had received ≤2 lines of chemotherapy for mBC. Patients were randomized to olaparib tablets (300 mg bid) or predeclared TPC (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). OS and safety were secondary end points.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 205 patients were randomized to olaparib and 97 to TPC. At 64% data maturity, median OS was 19.3 months with olaparib versus 17.1 months with TPC (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66-1.23; P = 0.513); median follow-up was 25.3 and 26.3 months, respectively. HR for OS with olaparib versus TPC in prespecified subgroups were: prior chemotherapy for mBC [no (first-line setting): 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; yes (second/third-line): 1.13, 0.79-1.64]; receptor status (triple negative: 0.93, 0.62-1.43; hormone receptor positive: 0.86, 0.55-1.36); prior platinum (yes: 0.83, 0.49-1.45; no: 0.91, 0.64-1.33). Adverse events during olaparib treatment were generally low grade and manageable by supportive treatment or dose modification. There was a low rate of treatment discontinuation (4.9%), and the risk of developing anemia did not increase with extended olaparib exposure.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "While there was no statistically significant improvement in OS with olaparib compared to TPC, there was the possibility of meaningful OS benefit among patients who had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Olaparib was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity during extended exposure. Please see the article online for additional video content.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In the adjuvant setting, tamoxifen is the established treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. However, it is associated with several side-effects including endometrial cancer and thromboembolic disorders. We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy outcomes of tamoxifen with those of anastrozole alone and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen for 5 years.",
        "Methods": "Participants were postmenopausal patients with invasive operable breast cancer who had completed primary therapy and were eligible to receive adjuvant hormonal therapy. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival and occurrence of adverse events. Analysis for efficacy was by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "9366 patients were recruited, of whom 3125 were randomly assigned anastrozole, 3116 tamoxifen, and 3125 combination. Median follow-up was 33.3 months. 7839 (84%) patients were known to be hormone-receptor-positive. Disease-free survival at 3 years was 89.4% on anastrozole and 87.4% on tamoxifen (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.71-0.96], p=0.013). Results with the combination were not significantly different from those with tamoxifen alone (87.2%, 1.02 [0.89-1.18], p=0.8). The improvement in disease-free survival with anastrozole was seen in the subgroup of hormone-receptor-positive patients, but not the receptor-negative patients. Incidence of contralateral breast cancer was significantly lower with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (odds ratio 0.42 [0.22-0.79], p=0.007). Anastrozole was significantly better tolerated than tamoxifen with respect to endometrial cancer (p=0.02), vaginal bleeding and discharge (p<0.0001 for both), cerebrovascular events (p=0.0006), venous thromboembolic events (p=0.0006), and hot flushes (p<0.0001). Tamoxifen was significantly better tolerated than anastrozole with respect to musculoskeletal disorders and fractures (p<0.0001 for both).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole is an effective and well tolerated endocrine option for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer. Longer follow-up is required before a final benefit:risk assessment can be made.",

This report presents results of a prospective, open-label, randomized study, designed to evaluate the benefits of switching to anastrozole after 2 years of tamoxifen treatment, compared with continuing on tamoxifen for 5 years.",
        "Methods": "After receiving tamoxifen treatment for 2 years, eligible patients (n = 979) were randomly assigned to switch to anastrozole (1 mg/d) or continue tamoxifen (20 or 30 mg/d) for an additional 3 years.

The primary efficacy variable was disease-free survival, including local or distant recurrence, new contralateral breast cancer, or death. Secondary variables were overall survival and assessment of safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "Switching to anastrozole resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.00; P = .049), and improved overall survival (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.99; P = .045) compared with continuing on tamoxifen. Fewer patients who switched to anastrozole reported serious adverse events (22.7% v 30.8%) compared with those who continued on tamoxifen, mainly due to more patients in the tamoxifen group with endometrial events. The overall safety profile for anastrozole was consistent with previous reports and no new safety issues were identified.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postmenopausal women who have taken tamoxifen for 2 years as adjuvant therapy are less likely to experience a recurrence of breast cancer and have improved overall survival if they switch to anastrozole compared with continuing to receive tamoxifen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In order to reduce mutilation, nipple-areola complex (NAC) conservation can be proposed for the treatment of breast cancer when mastectomy is indicated. To reduce the risk of retro areolar recurrence, a novel radiosurgical treatment combining subcutaneous mastectomy with intraoperative radiotherapy (ELIOT) is proposed. One thousand and one nipple sparing mastectomies (NSM) were performed from March 2002 to November 2007 at the European institute of oncology (EIO), for invasive carcinoma in 82% of the patients and in situ carcinoma in 18%. Clinical complications, aesthetic results, oncological and psychological results were recorded. A comparison was performed between the 800 patients who received ELIOT and the 201 who underwent delayed one-shot radiotherapy on the days following the operation. The median follow up time was 20 months (range 1-69) for a follow up performed in 83% of the patients. The NAC necrosed totally in 35 cases (3.5%) and partially in 55 (5.5%) and was removed in 50 (5%). Twenty infections (2%) were observed and 43 (4.3%) prostheses removed. The median rate of the patients for global cosmetic result on a scale ranging from 0 (worst) to 10 (excellent) was 8. Evaluation by the surgeon in charge of the follow-up gave a similar result. Only 15% of the patients reported a partial sensitivity of the NAC. Of the fourteen (1.4%) local recurrences, ten occurred close to the tumour site, all far from the NAC corresponding to the field of radiation. No recurrences were observed in the NAC. In a group of patients characterized by a very close free margin under the areola, no local recurrence was observed. Overall, 36 cases of metastases and 4 deaths were observed. No significant outcome difference was observed between the 800 patients receiving intraoperative radiotherapy (ELIOT) and the 201 patients receiving delayed irradiation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In order to define the term \"a node-negative patient\", the axillary nodal status at the primary operation for breast cancer was evaluated in 13,851 patients registered by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). The determinants for node negativity in primary breast cancer were the number of lymph nodes removed and the tumour size. The number of lymph nodes removed should be at least 10 to exclude misclassification of node-positive patients as node negative. There was a strong relationship between tumour size and the percentage of node-negative patients. Another observation was that high rate of node negativity was associated with low histological grade. The age of the patients had no influence on node negativity. Where 10 or more negative lymph nodes were removed, significantly better axillary recurrence-free survival (P less than 0.0001), over-all recurrence-free survival (P less than 0.0001) and survival (P less than 0.005) were found.",

MONALEESA-7 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with advanced, HR-positive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at 188 centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were premenopausal women aged 18-59 years who had histologically or cytologically confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria, or at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion; and had not received previous treatment with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors. Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting was permitted, as was up to one line of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via interactive response technology to receive oral ribociclib (600 mg/day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) or matching placebo with either oral tamoxifen (20 mg daily) or a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (letrozole 2·5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg, both oral, daily), all with goserelin (3·6 mg administered subcutaneously on day 1 of every 28-day cycle). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. MONALEESA-7 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,   and is ongoing, but no longer enrolling patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 17, 2014, and Aug 1, 2016, 672 patients were randomly assigned: 335 to the ribociclib group and 337 to the placebo group. Per investigator's assessment, median progression-free survival was 23·8 months (95% CI 19·2-not reached) in the ribociclib group compared with 13·0 months (11·0-16·4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·44-0·69; p<0·0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients in either group were neutropenia (203 [61%] of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 12 [4%] of 337 in the placebo group) and leucopenia (48 [14%] and four [1%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 60 (18%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 39 (12%) of 337 in the placebo group, of which 15 (4%) and six (2%), respectively, were attributed to the study regimen. 12 (4%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and ten (3%) of 337 in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 11 deaths occurred (five [1%] in the ribociclib group and six [2%] in the placebo group) during or within 30 days after treatment, most of which were due to progression of the underlying breast cancer (three [1%] and six [2%]). The remaining two deaths in the ribociclib group were due to an intracranial haemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient, and a pre-existing wound haemorrhage in another patient.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy improved progression-free survival compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy, and had a manageable safety profile in patients with premenopausal, HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer. The combination could represent a new first-line treatment option for these patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2)-positive advanced breast cancer, taxanes or vinorelbine plus trastuzumab are among the most widely applied options in the first-line setting. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine plus trastuzumab after anthracycline and docetaxel or vinorelbine failure and prior trastuzumab exposure.",
        "Methods": "Forty consecutive patients were included. Capecitabine was administered at a dose of 1,250 mg/m(2) bid for 14 consecutive days in 3-week cycles, with dose modifications if necessary. Trastuzumab was administered every 3 weeks. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as primary end point. Response was evaluated every 3 months using International Union Against Cancer criteria.",
        "Results/Findings": "TTP was a median of 8 months, and overall survival was 24 months. No significant difference was found for second-line and beyond second-line treatment. A complete response (CR) was observed in 2.5%, partial response (PR) in 17.5%, stable disease lasting at least 6 months (SD) in 50%, resulting in a clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD > or = 6 months) of 70%. Diarrhea (5%) and hand-foot syndrome (15%) were the only treatment-related adverse events that occurred with grade 3 or 4 intensity. Three patients (7.5%) developed brain metastases while receiving therapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Capecitabine plus trastuzumab appears to be an effective and safe option in a heavily pretreated population. Therefore, a direct comparison of this regimen with capecitabine monotherapy in this setting is warranted.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In hormone-dependent breast cancer, five years of postoperative tamoxifen therapy--but not tamoxifen therapy of longer duration--prolongs disease-free and overall survival. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole, by suppressing estrogen production, might improve the outcome after the discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of five years of letrozole therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have completed five years of tamoxifen therapy. The primary end point was disease-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 5187 women were enrolled (median follow-up, 2.4 years). At the first interim analysis, there were 207 local or metastatic recurrences of breast cancer or new primary cancers in the contralateral breast--75 in the letrozole group and 132 in the placebo group--with estimated four-year disease-free survival rates of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively, in the two groups (P< or =0.001 for the comparison of disease-free survival). A total of 42 women in the placebo group and 31 women in the letrozole group died (P=0.25 for the comparison of overall survival). Low-grade hot flashes, arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia were more frequent in the letrozole group, but vaginal bleeding was less frequent. There were new diagnoses of osteoporosis in 5.8 percent of the women in the letrozole group and 4.5 percent of the women in the placebo group (P=0.07); the rates of fracture were similar. After the first interim analysis, the independent data and safety monitoring committee recommended termination of the trial and prompt communication of the results to the participants.",

        "Background/Purpose": "In early breast cancer, variations in local treatment that substantially affect the risk of locoregional recurrence could also affect long-term breast cancer mortality. To examine this relationship, collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken, based on individual patient data, of the relevant randomised trials that began by 1995.",
        "Methods": "Information was available on 42,000 women in 78 randomised treatment comparisons (radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy, 23,500; more vs less surgery, 9300; more surgery vs radiotherapy, 9300). 24 types of local treatment comparison were identified. To help relate the effect on local (ie, locoregional) recurrence to that on breast cancer mortality, these were grouped according to whether or not the 5-year local recurrence risk exceeded 10% (<10%, 17,000 women; >10%, 25,000 women).",
        "Results/Findings": "About three-quarters of the eventual local recurrence risk occurred during the first 5 years. In the comparisons that involved little (<10%) difference in 5-year local recurrence risk there was little difference in 15-year breast cancer mortality. Among the 25,000 women in the comparisons that involved substantial (>10%) differences, however, 5-year local recurrence risks were 7% active versus 26% control (absolute reduction 19%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks were 44.6% versus 49.5% (absolute reduction 5.0%, SE 0.8, 2p<0.00001). These 25,000 women included 7300 with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in trials of radiotherapy (generally just to the conserved breast), with 5-year local recurrence risks (mainly in the conserved breast, as most had axillary clearance and node-negative disease) 7% versus 26% (reduction 19%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks 30.5% versus 35.9% (reduction 5.4%, SE 1.7, 2p=0.0002; overall mortality reduction 5.3%, SE 1.8, 2p=0.005). They also included 8500 with mastectomy, axillary clearance, and node-positive disease in trials of radiotherapy (generally to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes), with similar absolute gains from radiotherapy; 5-year local recurrence risks (mainly at these sites) 6% versus 23% (reduction 17%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks 54.7% versus 60.1% (reduction 5.4%, SE 1.3, 2p=0.0002; overall mortality reduction 4.4%, SE 1.2, 2p=0.0009). Radiotherapy produced similar proportional reductions in local recurrence in all women (irrespective of age or tumour characteristics) and in all major trials of radiotherapy versus not (recent or older; with or without systemic therapy), so large absolute reductions in local recurrence were seen only if the control risk was large. To help assess the life-threatening side-effects of radiotherapy, the trials of radiotherapy versus not were combined with those of radiotherapy versus more surgery. There was, at least with some of the older radiotherapy regimens, a significant excess incidence of contralateral breast cancer (rate ratio 1.18, SE 0.06, 2p=0.002) and a significant excess of non-breast-cancer mortality in irradiated women (rate ratio 1.12, SE 0.04, 2p=0.001). Both were slight during the first 5 years, but continued after year 15. The excess mortality was mainly from heart disease (rate ratio 1.27, SE 0.07, 2p=0.0001) and lung cancer (rate ratio 1.78, SE 0.22, 2p=0.0004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In these trials, avoidance of a local recurrence in the conserved breast after BCS and avoidance of a local recurrence elsewhere (eg, the chest wall or regional nodes) after mastectomy were of comparable relevance to 15-year breast cancer mortality. Differences in local treatment that substantially affect local recurrence rates would, in the hypothetical absence of any other causes of death, avoid about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years for every four local recurrences avoided, and should reduce 15-year overall mortality.",

The primary end point was progression-free survival; overall survival was a secondary end point.",
        "Results/Findings": "From December 2001 through May 2004, a total of 722 patients were enrolled.

Here, we present 5-year follow-up results.",
        "Methods": "We did a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial at 16 hospitals and medical centres in seven European countries. 1184 patients with low-risk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ treated with breast-conserving surgery were centrally randomised to either whole-breast irradiation or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Analysis was done according to treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between April 20, 2004, and July 30, 2009, 551 patients had whole-breast irradiation with tumour-bed boost and 633 patients received APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy. At 5-year follow-up, nine patients treated with APBI and five patients receiving whole-breast irradiation had a local recurrence; the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 1.44% (95% CI 0.51-2.38) with APBI and 0.92% (0.12-1.73) with whole-breast irradiation (difference 0.52%, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.75; p=0.42). No grade 4 late side-effects were reported. The 5-year risk of grade 2-3 late side-effects to the skin was 3.2% with APBI versus 5.7% with whole-breast irradiation (p=0.08), and 5-year risk of grade 2-3 subcutaneous tissue late side-effects was 7.6% versus 6.3% (p=0.53). The risk of severe (grade 3) fibrosis at 5 years was 0.2% with whole-breast irradiation and 0% with APBI (p=0.46).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The difference between treatments was below the relevance margin of 3 percentage points. Therefore, adjuvant APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early breast cancer is not inferior to adjuvant whole-breast irradiation with respect to 5-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival.",

Here, we report the planned final analysis based on the prespecified number of occurring events.",
        "Methods": "PHARE is an open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority randomised trial of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer comparing 6 months versus 12 months of trastuzumab treatment concomitant with or following standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The study was undertaken in 156 centres in France. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast and either positive axillary nodes or negative axillary nodes but a tumour of at least 10 mm. Participants must have received at least four cycles of a chemotherapy for this breast cancer and have started receiving adjuvant trastuzumab-treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either 6 months or 12 months of trastuzumab therapy duration between the third and sixth months of adjuvant trastuzumab. The randomisation was stratified by concomitant or sequential treatment with chemotherapy, oestrogen receptor status, and centre. The primary objective was non-inferiority in the intention-to-treat population in the 6-month group in terms of disease-free survival with a prespecified hazard margin of 1·15. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "3384 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 12 months (n=1691) or 6 months (n=1693) of adjuvant trastuzumab. One patient in the 12-month group and three patients in the 6-month group were excluded, so 1690 patients in each group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At a median follow-up of 7·5 years (IQR 5·3-8·8), 704 events relevant to disease-free survival were observed (345 [20·4%] in the 12-month group and 359 [21·2%] in the 6-month group). The adjusted hazard ratio for disease-free survival in the 12-month group versus the 6-month group was 1·08 (95% CI 0·93-1·25; p=0·39). The non-inferiority margin was included in the 95% CI. No differences in effects pertaining to trastuzumab duration were found in any of the subgroups. After the completion of trastuzumab treatment, rare adverse events occurred over time and the safety analysis remained similar to the previously published report. In particular, we found no change in the cardiac safety comparison, and only three additional cases in which the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased to less than 50% have been reported in the 12-month group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The PHARE study did not show the non-inferiority of 6 months versus 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab. Hence, adjuvant trastuzumab standard duration should remain 12 months.",

Tamoxifen therapy resulted in statistically significant reductions in the risk of adenosis (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.73), cyst (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.75), duct ectasia (RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.97), fibrocystic disease (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.77), hyperplasia (RR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.71), and metaplasia (RR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.62). Tamoxifen therapy also reduced the risk for fibroadenoma (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.56 to 1.04) and fibrosis (RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.03). Compared with the placebo group, the tamoxifen group had 29% (95% CI = 23% to 34%) fewer biopsies (1048 versus 1469) and 19% fewer women who underwent a biopsy (811 versus 1019). This resulted in a 29% reduction in the risk of biopsy in women treated with tamoxifen (RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.77). This risk reduction occurred predominantly in women younger than 50 years.",

Almost three fourths had received some form of adjuvant therapy. Amenorrhea occurred frequently as a result of treatment in women > or = 40 years at diagnosis, and treatment-associated menopause was associated with poorer health perceptions. Across the cohort, physical functioning was quite good, but the youngest women experienced poorer mental health (P =.0002) and less vitality (energy; P =.03). Multiple regression analyses predicting QOL demonstrated better outcomes in African-American women, married or partnered women, and women with better emotional and physical functioning, whereas women who reported greater vulnerability had poorer QOL.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Overall QOL in younger women who survive breast cancer is good, but there is evidence of increased emotional disruption, especially among the youngest women. Factors that may contribute to poorer health perceptions and QOL include experiencing a menopausal transition as part of therapy, and feeling more vulnerable after cancer.",

Incidence of locoregional and distant events remained similar in both treatment groups; deaths were only infrequently related to breast cancer. Incidence of noninvasive IBT was reduced from 13.4% to 8.2% (P = .007), and of invasive IBT, from 13.4% to 3.9% (P < .0001). All cohorts benefited from radiation regardless of clinical or mammographic tumor characteristics.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Through 8 years of follow-up, our findings continue to indicate that lumpectomy plus radiation is more beneficial than lumpectomy alone for women with localized, mammographically detected DCIS. When evaluated according to the mammographic characteristics of their DCIS, all groups benefited from radiation.",

Comprehensive patient-reported outcome measures collected at serial time points are now reported.",
        "Methods": "IMPORT LOW recruited women with low-risk breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast and 40 Gy partial-breast radiotherapy (reduced-dose), or 40 Gy partial-breast radiotherapy only (partial-breast) in 15 fractions. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires Core 30 and Breast Cancer-Specific Module, Body Image Scale, protocol-specific items, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered at baseline, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5 years. Patterns of moderate/marked adverse effects (AEs) were assessed using longitudinal regression models, and baseline predictors were investigated.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 41 of 71 centers participated in the patient-reported outcome measures substudy; 1,265 (95%) of 1,333 patients consented, and 557 (58%) of 962 reported no moderate/marked AEs at 5 years. Breast appearance change was most prevalent and persisted over time (approximately 20% at each time point). Prevalence of breast hardness, pain, oversensitivity, edema, and skin changes reduced over time ( P < .001 for each), whereas breast shrinkage increased ( P < .001). Analysis by treatment group showed average number of AEs per person was lower in partial-breast (incidence rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and reduced-dose (incidence rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.90; P < .001) versus whole-breast group and decreased over time in all groups. Younger age, larger breast size/surgical deficit, lymph node positivity, and higher levels of anxiety/depression were baseline predictors of subsequent AE reporting.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Most AEs reduced over time, with fewer AEs in the partial-breast and reduced-dose groups. Baseline predictors for AE reporting were identified.

This report focuses on the TNBC cohort.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 111 patients with TNBC whose tumor samples were screened for PD-L1 expression, 58.6% had PD-L1-positive tumors. Thirty-two women (median age, 50.5 years; range, 29 to 72 years) were enrolled and assessed for safety and antitumor activity. The median number of doses administered was five (range, 1 to 36 doses). Common toxicities were mild and similar to those observed in other tumor cohorts (eg, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea), and included five (15.6%) patients with grade ≥ 3 toxicity and one treatment-related death. Among the 27 patients who were evaluable for antitumor activity, the overall response rate was 18.5%, the median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range, 7.3 to 32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range, 15.0 to ≥ 47.3 weeks).",

        "Results/Findings": "Two hundred eleven patients had 331 direct-to-implant reconstructions using AlloDerm following nipple-sparing (n = 66) or skin-sparing (n = 265) mastectomy for cancer (n = 216) or prophylaxis (n = 115). The number of single-stage implant reconstructions increased from seven in 2006 to 116 in 2009. The percentage performed for prophylaxis increased from 29 percent to 41 percent. Fifty-one patients underwent preoperative (n = 33) or postoperative (n = 18) irradiation. Total complications included 10 infections (3.0 percent), five seromas (1.5 percent), four hematomas (1.2 percent), and 30 reconstructions (9.1 percent), with skin necrosis leading to five implant losses (1.5 percent). Tissue expander reconstruction without AlloDerm had a similar total complication rate (158 reconstructions) (p = 0.18), including nine infections (5.7 percent), three seromas (1.9 percent), three hematomas (1.9 percent), and 16 reconstructions (10.1 percent), with skin necrosis leading to 11 implant losses (7.0 percent). A higher complication rate occurred in the surgeons' combined first year performing single-stage implant reconstruction (21.4 percent) compared with subsequent years (10.9 percent) (p < 0.02) and in one- or two-stage reconstruction patients undergoing irradiation (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in total overall costs (p = 0.8).",

Although axillary lymph node dissection provides excellent regional control, it is associated with harmful side-effects. We aimed to assess whether axillary radiotherapy provides comparable regional control with fewer side-effects.",
        "Methods": "Patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy were enrolled in the randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 non-inferiority EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive either axillary lymph node dissection or axillary radiotherapy in case of a positive sentinel node, stratified by institution. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of 5-year axillary recurrence, considered to be not more than 4% for the axillary radiotherapy group compared with an expected 2% in the axillary lymph node dissection group. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol. The AMAROS trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 19, 2001, and April 29, 2010, 4823 patients were enrolled at 34 centres from nine European countries, of whom 4806 were eligible for randomisation. 2402 patients were randomly assigned to receive axillary lymph node dissection and 2404 to receive axillary radiotherapy. Of the 1425 patients with a positive sentinel node, 744 had been randomly assigned to axillary lymph node dissection and 681 to axillary radiotherapy; these patients constituted the intention-to-treat population. Median follow-up was 6·1 years (IQR 4·1-8·0) for the patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes. In the axillary lymph node dissection group, 220 (33%) of 672 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection had additional positive nodes. Axillary recurrence occurred in four of 744 patients in the axillary lymph node dissection group and seven of 681 in the axillary radiotherapy group. 5-year axillary recurrence was 0·43% (95% CI 0·00-0·92) after axillary lymph node dissection versus 1·19% (0·31-2·08) after axillary radiotherapy. The planned non-inferiority test was underpowered because of the low number of events. The one-sided 95% CI for the underpowered non-inferiority test on the hazard ratio was 0·00-5·27, with a non-inferiority margin of 2. Lymphoedema in the ipsilateral arm was noted significantly more often after axillary lymph node dissection than after axillary radiotherapy at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Axillary lymph node dissection and axillary radiotherapy after a positive sentinel node provide excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy. Axillary radiotherapy results in significantly less morbidity.",

This study assessed the prognostic impact of HER2 overexpression/amplification in a large series of node-negative breast cancers.",
        "Methods": "A tissue microarray (TMA) series was constructed consisting of 4,444 invasive breast cancers diagnosed in British Columbia from 1986 to 1992. Within this series, 2,026 patients were node negative, of whom 70% did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy. The TMA series was assessed for estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate odds ratios at the 10-year follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER2 was positive in 10.2% of the node-negative cohort. In this cohort, an inferior outcome was seen in patients with HER2-positive tumors compared with HER2-negative tumors for 10-year relapse-free survival (RFS; 65.9% v 75.5%, respectively; P = .01), distant RFS (71.2% v 81.8%, respectively; P = .004), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS; 75.5% v 86.3%, respectively; P = .001). A trend for a worse overall survival was also seen (P = .06). HER2 was an independent poor prognostic factor for RFS and BCSS at 10 years, with odds ratios of 1.71 (P = .01) and 2.03 (P = .003), respectively. The number of HER2-positive tumors that were <or= 1 cm was small, but there was a trend for a worse outcome in T1b tumors.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "HER2 overexpression/amplification is correlated with a poorer outcome in node-negative breast cancer. Larger studies are needed to more clearly define the prognostic impact of HER2 in tumors <or= 1 cm, particularly within the separate hormone receptor subgroups.",

Preliminary data have suggested that newer antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, can diminish hot flashes. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial to assess the efficacy of venlafaxine in women with a history of breast cancer or reluctance to take hormonal treatment because of fear of breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Participants were assigned placebo (n=56) or venlafaxine 37.5 mg daily (n=56), 75 mg daily (n=55), or 150 mg daily (n=54). After a baseline assessment week, patients took the study medication for 4 weeks. All venlafaxine treatment started at 37.5 mg daily and gradually increased in the 75 mg and 150 mg groups. Patients completed daily hot-flash questionnaire diaries. The primary endpoint was average daily hot-flash activity (number of flashes and a score combining number and severity). Analyses were based on the women who provided data throughout the baseline and study weeks.",
        "Results/Findings": "191 patients had evaluable data for the whole study period (50 placebo, 49 venlafaxine 37.5 mg, 43 venlafaxine 75 mg, 49 venlafaxine 150 mg). After week 4 of treatment, median hot flash scores were reduced from baseline by 27% (95% CI 11-34), 37% (26-54), 61% (50-68), and 61% (48-75) in the four groups. Frequencies of some side-effects (mouth dryness, decreased appetite, nausea, and constipation) were significantly higher in the venlafaxine 75 mg and 150 mg groups than in the placebo group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Venlafaxine is an effective non-hormonal treatment for hot flashes, though the efficacy must be balanced against the drug's side-effects. Confirmation of the results of this 4-week study awaits the completion of three ongoing randomised studies to assess the effects of other related antidepressants for the treatment of hot flashes.",

Discordance of hormone and HER-2 receptors were reported in a series of studies. Receptor status was reported to change in both directions, yet alteration occurs mostly in the loss of positivity for both receptors. We do not know both the exact mechanism of this process or the contribution rate of technical mistakes; a number of mechanisms might be responsible. Factors suggested include: tumor heterogeneity, clonal selection of tumor cell subpopulations, genetic instability of tumor cells, local or systemic treatments, the time interval between primary tumor and metastasis, receptor status determination techniques, and the site of metastasis.",

        "Background/Purpose": "HER-2 is over-expressed in around 25% of human breast cancers, and is associated with poor outcome. We examined the incidence of HER-2 status in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Forty-nine newly diagnosed IBCs were studied. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pre-treatment tissue biopsies were examined immunohistochemically for the over-expression of the HER-2 protein and gene using the HercepTest and FISH assay. Clinical outcome was compared between the HER-2 positive (HercepTest score 3 + and FISH positive) and negative groups. Fifty-two per cent of the IBCs examined were HER-2 positive. The HER-2 positive group were demographically comparable to the HER-2 negative group. Ninety-six per cent of the HER-2 positive patients responded to primary chemotherapy compared to 76% of the HER-2 negative (P = 0.09). No significant differences in outcome emerged between the two groups. In conclusion, this study found the incidence of HER-2 protein over-expression in IBC is higher than previously reported in non-IBC. Early HER-2 directed therapy (such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab) as a part of multimodal treatment may improve outcome in this poor prognosis cancer.",

Chemotherapy trials have supported an interaction between HER-2 overexpression and chemotherapy sensitivity (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil resistance and doxorubicin sensitivity) which is compelling. More recently, HER-2 has been the target for Food and Drug Administration-approved antibody therapy, trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA). The Clinical Trials Assay, a scoring system for tumor material, has been used successfully in the trastuzumab clinical development program.

        "Background/Purpose": "Given the poor results using hypofractionated radiotherapy for early breast cancer, a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions (fr) has been the standard regimen used by the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) since 1982. Results from more recent trials have stimulated a renewed interest in hypofractionation, and the noninferiority DBCG HYPO trial (ClincalTrials.gov identifier:  ) was designed to determine whether a dose of 40 Gy in 15 fr does not increase the occurrence of breast induration at 3 years compared with a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fr.",
        "Methods": "One thousand eight hundred eighty-two patients > 40 years of age who underwent breast-conserving surgery for node-negative breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were randomly assigned to radiotherapy at a dose of either 50 Gy in 25 fr or 40 Gy in 15 fr. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration assuming noninferiority regarding locoregional recurrence.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1,854 consenting patients (50 Gy, n = 937; 40 Gy, n = 917) were enrolled from 2009-2014 from eight centers. There were 1,608 patients with adenocarcinoma and 246 patients with DCIS. The 3-year rates of induration were 11.8% (95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 9.0% (95% CI, 7.2% to 11.1%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.6% to 0.2%;   = .07). Systemic therapies and radiotherapy boost did not increase the risk of induration. Telangiectasia, dyspigmentation, scar appearance, edema, and pain were detected at low rates, and cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction with breast appearance were high with either no difference or better outcome in the 40-Gy cohort compared with the 50-Gy cohort. The 9-year risk of locoregional recurrence was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0% to 5.0%) in the 50-Gy group and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9% to 4.5%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, -0.3%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 1.7%). The 9-year overall survival was 93.4% (95% CI, 91.1% to 95.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 93.4% (95% CI, 91.0% to 95.2%) in the 40-Gy group. The occurrence of radiation-associated cardiac and lung disease was rare and not influenced by the fractionation regimen.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation of node-negative breast cancer or DCIS did not result in more breast induration compared with standard fractionated therapy. Other normal tissue effects were minimal, with similar or less frequent rates in the 40-Gy group. The 9-year locoregional recurrence risk was low.",

Mutation carriers selecting breast-conservation therapy (BCT) for treatment of operable breast cancer experience a higher rate of new primary breast cancers. We sought to determine the frequency of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in women who underwent BCT. Genetic testing results were compared with the prior probability of mutations in either gene.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 predispose individuals to breast cancer (termed germline-mutated BRCA1/2 breast cancer, gBRCA-BC) by impairing homologous recombination (HR) and causing genomic instability. HR also repairs DNA lesions caused by platinum agents and PARP inhibitors. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) harbor subpopulations with BRCA1/2 mutations, hypothesized to be especially platinum-sensitive. Cancers in putative 'BRCAness' subgroups-tumors with BRCA1 methylation; low levels of BRCA1 mRNA (BRCA1 mRNA-low); or mutational signatures for HR deficiency and those with basal phenotypes-may also be sensitive to platinum. We assessed the efficacy of carboplatin and another mechanistically distinct therapy, docetaxel, in a phase 3 trial in subjects with unselected advanced TNBC. A prespecified protocol enabled biomarker-treatment interaction analyses in gBRCA-BC and BRCAness subgroups. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). In the unselected population (376 subjects; 188 carboplatin, 188 docetaxel), carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR, 31.4% versus 34.0%, respectively; P = 0.66). In contrast, in subjects with gBRCA-BC, carboplatin had double the ORR of docetaxel (68% versus 33%, respectively; biomarker, treatment interaction P = 0.01). Such benefit was not observed for subjects with BRCA1 methylation, BRCA1 mRNA-low tumors or a high score in a Myriad HRD assay. Significant interaction between treatment and the basal-like subtype was driven by high docetaxel response in the nonbasal subgroup. We conclude that patients with advanced TNBC benefit from characterization of BRCA1/2 mutations, but not BRCA1 methylation or Myriad HRD analyses, to inform choices on platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, gene expression analysis of basal-like cancers may also influence treatment selection.",

Characteristics of the 77 eligible patients included median age of 68 years, performance score of 0 or 1 in 91% of patients, visceral dominant disease in 88% of patients, two prior hormonal treatments in 73% of patients, and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease in 32% of patients. Eleven patients (14.3%) achieved a partial response, and 16 patients (20.8%) had stable disease for at least 6 months, for a clinical benefit rate of 35%. Antitumor activity seemed to be higher in women with prior treatment with AI alone compared with women whose prior treatment also included tamoxifen. Median time to progression was 3 months, and median survival time was 20.2 months. Fulvestrant was well tolerated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Fulvestrant fIRst-line Study comparing endocrine Treatments is a phase II, randomized, open-label study comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg as first-line endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer. At data cut-off, only 36 % of patients had progressed and the median time to progression (TTP) had not been reached for fulvestrant. Here, we report follow-up data for TTP for fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg. Key inclusion criteria were postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and no prior endocrine therapy. Key exclusion criteria were presence of life-threatening metastases and prior treatment with a non-approved drug. Fulvestrant was administered 500 mg/month plus 500 mg on day 14 of month 1; anastrozole was administered 1 mg/day. TTP was defined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0 before data cut-off for the primary analysis, and investigator opinion after data cut-off. Best overall response to subsequent therapy and serious adverse events are also reported. In total, 205 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 102) or anastrozole (n = 103). Follow-up analysis was performed when 79.5 % of patients had discontinued study treatment. Median TTP was 23.4 months for fulvestrant versus 13.1 months for anastrozole; a 34 % reduction in risk of progression (hazard ratio 0.66; 95 % confidence interval: 0.47, 0.92; P = 0.01). Best overall response to subsequent therapy and clinical benefit rate for subsequent endocrine therapy was similar between the treatment groups. No new safety concerns for fulvestrant 500 mg were documented. These longer-term, follow-up results confirm efficacy benefit for fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole as first-line endocrine therapy for HR+ advanced breast cancer in terms of TTP, and, importantly, show similar best overall response rates to subsequent endocrine therapy.",

Of 43 evaluable patients 36% (eight of 22) treated with Epi and 38% (eight of 21) treated with Dox achieved a complete plus partial response rate (95% confidence limits 16-56% +/- 20% and 18-58% +/- 20%, respectively). Patients who obtained a major therapeutic response to previous CMF exhibited a significantly higher response rate with both the drugs: seven of eight (87.5%) compared with one of 13 (8%); p less than 0.05 for Epi and six of seven (86%) compared with two of 15 (13%); p less than 0.05 for Dox. The median duration of response was 4.5 months with Epi compared with 7 months with Dox, and the median survival of the two groups of patients were superimposable (12 months with Epi versus 11 months with Dox). The median cumulative dose was 220 mg/m2 (range 160-620) and 240 mg/m2 (range 160-860) for Epi and Dox, respectively. Gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities were moderate for both the drugs, with fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, and leukopenia following Epi administration. A very low incidence of alopecia was recorded for both the drugs. Regarding cardiac evaluation, no significant differences were evident; however, the only case that developed symptomatic congestive heart failure was in the Dox arm, after a cumulative dose of 820 mg/m2 at 11.5 months.

        "Background/Purpose": "For women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer, treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years substantially reduces the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the first 15 years after diagnosis. We aimed to assess the further effects of continuing tamoxifen to 10 years instead of stopping at 5 years.",
        "Methods": "In the worldwide Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial, 12,894 women with early breast cancer who had completed 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomly allocated to continue tamoxifen to 10 years or stop at 5 years (open control). Allocation (1:1) was by central computer, using minimisation. After entry (between 1996 and 2005), yearly follow-up forms recorded any recurrence, second cancer, hospital admission, or death. We report effects on breast cancer outcomes among the 6846 women with ER-positive disease, and side-effects among all women (with positive, negative, or unknown ER status). Long-term follow-up still continues. This study is registered, number ISRCTN19652633.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among women with ER-positive disease, allocation to continue tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences in 3428 women allocated to continue vs 711 in 3418 controls, p=0·002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths vs 397 deaths, p=0·01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths vs 722 deaths, p=0·01). The reductions in adverse breast cancer outcomes appeared to be less extreme before than after year 10 (recurrence rate ratio [RR] 0·90 [95% CI 0·79–1·02] during years 5–9 and 0·75 [0·62–0·90] in later years; breast cancer mortality RR 0·97 [0·79–1·18] during years 5–9 and 0·71 [0·58–0·88] in later years). The cumulative risk of recurrence during years 5–14 was 21·4% for women allocated to continue versus 25·1% for controls; breast cancer mortality during years 5–14 was 12·2% for women allocated to continue versus 15·0% for controls (absolute mortality reduction 2·8%). Treatment allocation seemed to have no effect on breast cancer outcome among 1248 women with ER-negative disease, and an intermediate effect among 4800 women with unknown ER status. Among all 12,894 women, mortality without recurrence from causes other than breast cancer was little affected (691 deaths without recurrence in 6454 women allocated to continue versus 679 deaths in 6440 controls; RR 0·99 [0·89–1·10]; p=0·84). For the incidence (hospitalisation or death) rates of specific diseases, RRs were as follows: pulmonary embolus 1·87 (95% CI 1·13–3·07, p=0·01 [including 0·2% mortality in both treatment groups]), stroke 1·06 (0·83–1·36), ischaemic heart disease 0·76 (0·60–0·95, p=0·02), and endometrial cancer 1·74 (1·30–2·34, p=0·0002). The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5–14 was 3·1% (mortality 0·4%) for women allocated to continue versus 1·6% (mortality 0·2%) for controls (absolute mortality increase 0·2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For women with ER-positive disease, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than stopping at 5 years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality, particularly after year 10. These results, taken together with results from previous trials of 5 years of tamoxifen treatment versus none, suggest that 10 years of tamoxifen treatment can approximately halve breast cancer mortality during the second decade after diagnosis.",

        "Background/Purpose": "For women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the benefit of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains unknown. Here we examine the relationship of MRI and locoregional recurrence (LRR) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) for DCIS treated with BCS, with and without radiotherapy (RT).",
        "Methods": "A total of 2,321 women underwent BCS for DCIS from 1997 to 2010. All underwent mammography, and 596 (26 %) also underwent perioperative MRI; 904 women (39 %) did not receive RT, and 1,391 (61 %) did. Median follow-up was 59 months, and 548 women were followed for ≥8 years. The relationship between MRI and LRR was examined using multivariable analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 184 LRR events; 5- and 8-year LRR rates were 8.5 and 14.6 % (MRI), respectively, and 7.2 and 10.2 % (no-MRI), respectively (p = 0.52). LRR was significantly associated with age, menopausal status, margin status, RT, and endocrine therapy. After controlling for these variables and family history, presentation, number of excisions, and time period of surgery, there remained no trend toward association of MRI and lower LRR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.78, p = 0.42]. Restriction of analysis to the no-RT subgroup showed no association of MRI with lower LRR rates (HR 1.36, 95 % CI 0.78-2.39, p = 0.28). No difference in 5- or 8-year rates of CBC was seen between the MRI (3.5 and 3.5 %) and no-MRI (3.5 and 5.1 %) groups (p = 0.86).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We observed no association between perioperative MRI and lower LRR or CBC rates in patients with DCIS, with or without RT. In the absence of evidence that MRI improves outcomes, the routine perioperative use of MRI for DCIS should be questioned.",

        "Background/Purpose": "For postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, the most effective duration for adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor remains unclear.",
        "Methods": "In this prospective, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who had received 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy to receive the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole for an additional 2 years (2-year group, receiving a total of 7 years) or an additional 5 years (5-year group, receiving a total of 10 years). The primary end point was disease-free survival. The primary analysis included all the patients who were still participating in the trial and who had no recurrence 2 years after randomization (i.e., when treatment in the 2-year group had ended). Secondary end points were overall survival, contralateral breast cancer, second primary cancer, and clinical bone fracture.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among the 3484 women who were enrolled in the trial, 3208 remained in the trial without disease progression after the first 2 years of extended anastrozole treatment following randomization. Among these women, disease progression or death occurred in 335 women in each treatment group in the primary-analysis set at 8 years (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.15; P = 0.90). No between-group differences occurred in most secondary end points, and subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in any particular subgroup. The risk of clinical bone fracture was higher in the 5-year group than in the 2-year group (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.84).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who had received 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, extending hormone therapy by 5 years provided no benefit over a 2-year extension but was associated with a greater risk of bone fracture.

        "Background/Purpose": "For patients with breast cancer and metastases in the sentinel nodes, axillary dissection has been standard treatment. However, for patients with limited sentinel-node involvement, axillary dissection might be overtreatment. We designed IBCSG trial 23-01 to determine whether no axillary dissection was non-inferior to axillary dissection in patients with one or more micrometastatic (≤2 mm) sentinel nodes and tumour of maximum 5 cm.",
        "Methods": "In this multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial, patients were eligible if they had clinically non-palpable axillary lymph node(s) and a primary tumour of 5 cm or less and who, after sentinel-node biopsy, had one or more micrometastatic (≤2 mm) sentinel lymph nodes with no extracapsular extension. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to either undergo axillary dissection or not to undergo axillary dissection. Randomisation was stratified by centre and menopausal status. Treatment assignment was not masked. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Non-inferiority was defined as a hazard ratio (HR) of less than 1·25 for no axillary dissection versus axillary dissection. The analysis was by intention to treat. Per protocol, disease and survival information continues to be collected yearly. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between April 1, 2001, and Feb 28, 2010, 465 patients were randomly assigned to axillary dissection and 469 to no axillary dissection. After the exclusion of three patients, 464 patients were in the axillary dissection group and 467 patients were in the no axillary dissection group. After a median follow-up of 5·0 (IQR 3·6-7·3) years, we recorded 69 disease-free survival events in the axillary dissection group and 55 events in the no axillary dissection group. Breast-cancer-related events were recorded in 48 patients in the axillary dissection group and 47 in the no axillary dissection group (ten local recurrences in the axillary dissection group and eight in the no axillary dissection group; three and nine contralateral breast cancers; one and five [corrected] regional recurrences; and 34 and 25 distant relapses). Other non-breast cancer events were recorded in 21 patients in the axillary dissection group and eight in the no axillary dissection group (20 and six second non-breast malignancies; and one and two deaths not due to a cancer event). 5-year disease-free survival was 87·8% (95% CI 84·4-91·2) in the group without axillary dissection and 84·4% (80·7-88·1) in the group with axillary dissection (log-rank p=0·16; HR for no axillary dissection vs axillary dissection was 0·78, 95% CI 0·55-1·11, non-inferiority p=0·0042). Patients with reported long-term surgical events (grade 3-4) included one sensory neuropathy (grade 3), three lymphoedema (two grade 3 and one grade 4), and three motor neuropathy (grade 3), all in the group that underwent axillary dissection, and one grade 3 motor neuropathy in the group without axillary dissection. One serious adverse event was reported, a postoperative infection in the axilla in the group with axillary dissection.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Axillary dissection could be avoided in patients with early breast cancer and limited sentinel-node involvement, thus eliminating complications of axillary surgery with no adverse effect on survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "For most older women with early breast cancer, standard treatment after breast-conserving surgery is adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy and adjuvant endocrine treatment. We aimed to assess the effect omission of whole-breast radiotherapy would have on local control in older women at low risk of local recurrence at 5 years.",
        "Methods": "Between April 16, 2003, and Dec 22, 2009, 1326 women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer judged low-risk (ie, hormone receptor-positive, axillary node-negative, T1-T2 up to 3 cm at the longest dimension, and clear margins; grade 3 tumour histology or lymphovascular invasion, but not both, were permitted), who had had breast-conserving surgery and were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment, were recruited into a phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 76 centres in four countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either whole-breast radiotherapy (40-50 Gy in 15-25 fractions) or no radiotherapy by computer-generated permuted block randomisation, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence. Follow-up continues and will end at the 10-year anniversary of the last randomised patient. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN95889329.",
        "Results/Findings": "658 women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and who were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation and 668 were allocated to no further treatment. After median follow-up of 5 years (IQR 3·84-6·05), ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was 1·3% (95% CI 0·2-2·3; n=5) in women assigned to whole-breast radiotherapy and 4·1% (2·4-5·7; n=26) in those assigned no radiotherapy (p=0·0002). Compared with women allocated to whole-breast radiotherapy, the univariate hazard ratio for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence in women assigned to no radiotherapy was 5·19 (95% CI 1·99-13·52; p=0·0007). No differences in regional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral breast cancers, or new breast cancers were noted between groups. 5-year overall survival was 93·9% (95% CI 91·8-96·0) in both groups (p=0·34). 89 women died; eight of 49 patients allocated to no radiotherapy and four of 40 assigned to radiotherapy died from breast cancer.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine treatment resulted in a significant but modest reduction in local recurrence for women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer 5 years after randomisation. However, the 5-year rate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence is probably low enough for omission of radiotherapy to be considered for some patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "For more than 20 years, tamoxifen has been the mainstay of adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer. However, not only does tamoxifen have potential side-effects such as an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events, but patients can also develop resistance to the drug. We aimed to investigate whether switching treatment of postmenopausal women with such breast cancer to anastrozole after 2-3 years of tamoxifen would be more effective than continuing on tamoxifen for a total of 5 years.",
        "Methods": "We did a meta-analysis of three clinical trials--the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG 8), Arimidex-Nolvadex (ARNO 95), and the Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole (ITA) studies--in which postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed, hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer were randomised to 1 mg/day anastrozole (n=2009) after 2-3 years of tamoxifen treatment or to continued 20 or 30 mg/day tamoxifen (n=1997). We analysed the data with a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with the covariates of age, tumour size, nodal status, grade, surgery, and chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients who switched to anastrozole had fewer disease recurrences (92 vs 159) and deaths (66 vs 90) than did those who remained on tamoxifen, resulting in significant improvements in disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.48-0.74]; p<0.0001), event-free survival (0.55 [0.42-0.71]; p<0.0001), distant recurrence-free survival (0.61 [0.45-0.83]; p=0.002), and overall survival (0.71 [0.52-0.98]; p=0.04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results show that the clinical benefits in terms of event-free survival seen in individual trials for those patients who switched to anastrozole translate into a benefit in overall survival. These findings confirm that clinicians should consider switching postmenopausal women who have taken adjuvant tamoxifen for 2-3 years to anastrozole.",

        "Background/Purpose": "For many young women with early breast cancer, fertility is a priority. Interventions to retain fertility options generally need to be accessed before chemotherapy, but many women do not receive information regarding these options in a timely fashion. Knowledge about fertility and decisional conflict has not previously been measured in young patients with breast cancer considering future pregnancies.",
        "Methods": "One hundred eleven young women with early breast cancer who had not yet completed their families were recruited around the time of diagnosis. Knowledge regarding fertility-related information, decisional conflict, and preferences regarding fertility information and decision making was measured.",
        "Results/Findings": "From a potential fertility-related knowledge score of 10, the mean was 5.2 (standard deviation = 2.3; range, 0 to 10). Decreased knowledge was associated with increased decisional conflict about pursuing fertility preserving interventions (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.73; P < .001). Thirty-one percent of women reported that they would consider undertaking in vitro fertilization (IVF) as a method to conserve their fertility, whereas 38% were uncertain. Consideration of IVF was not related to whether subjects were in a committed relationship (OR = 1.20; P = .716) or a definite desire for more children (OR = 1.54; P = .513).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Around diagnosis, many young patients with breast cancer have low levels of knowledge about fertility issues. Further, low knowledge is associated with increased decisional conflict, which is likely to undermine the quality of decision making. These findings suggest that targeted and timely fertility information may reduce decisional conflict and increase informed choice. Neither relationship status nor firm plans regarding future children reliably predict desire to pursue fertility preservation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Few studies have examined the possible importance of biologic prognostic factors in breast cancer connected with differentiation and growth in predicting response to a specific adjuvant treatment. HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and p53 have all been suggested as possible markers of tamoxifen resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate interactions between adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen and the content of EGFR, HER2, and p53 in steroid receptor-positive patients.",
        "Methods": "A total of 1,716 high-risk postmenopausal breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to treatment with tamoxifen (868 women) or to observation (848 women) in a prospective trial (Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group's 77c protocol). The content of the steroid receptors and expression of p53, EGFR, and HER2 were determined by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue. The length of follow-up was 10 years. The end point for this analysis was disease-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "Multivariate analysis demonstrated no increased risk of recurrence after treatment with tamoxifen for HER2-, EGFR-, and p53-positive, high-risk, steroid receptor-positive patients. Patients with steroid receptor-positive tumors and positive immunohistochemical staining for HER2, EGFR or p53 benefited from treatment with tamoxifen for 1 year, although the latter variable contained independent prognostic information by itself.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With the statistical power of the present randomized study, we did not find support for the hypothesis that HER2/EGFR or p53 status predicts benefit from tamoxifen treatment in estrogen receptor-positive patients with early-stage breast cancer. Thus, neither HER2, EGFR, nor p53 overexpression/accumulation should be used as a contraindication for giving tamoxifen.",

Clinical data, however, have been conflicting. We have conducted a meta-analysis on the interaction between the response to endocrine treatment and the overexpression of HER-2 in metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "Studies have been identified by searching the Medline, Embase, and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstract databases. Selection criteria were (a) metastatic breast cancer, (b) endocrine therapy (any line of treatment), and (c) evaluation of HER-2 expression (any method). For each study, the relative risk for treatment failure for HER-2-positive over HER-2-negative patients with 95% confidence interval was calculated as an estimate of the predictive effect of HER-2. Pooled estimates of the relative risk were computed by the Mantel-Haenszel method.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twelve studies (n = 2,379 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The overall relative risk was 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.52; P < 0.00001; test for heterogeneity = 0.380). For studies involving tamoxifen, the pooled relative risk was 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.48; P < 0.00001; test for heterogeneity = 0.97); for studies involving other hormonal drugs, a pooled relative risk of 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.36-1.64; P < 0.00001; test for heterogeneity = 0.08) was estimated. A second meta-analysis limited to tumors that were either estrogen receptor positive, estrogen receptor unknown, or estrogen receptor negative/progesterone receptor positive yielded comparable results.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Evidence-based treatments for metastatic, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer to the CNS are limited. We previously reported modest activity of neratinib monotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases. Here we report the results from additional study cohorts.",
        "Methods": "Patients with measurable, progressive, HER2-positive brain metastases (92% after receiving CNS surgery and/or radiotherapy) received neratinib 240 mg orally once per day plus capecitabine 750 mg/m  twice per day for 14 days, then 7 days off. Lapatinib-naïve (cohort 3A) and lapatinib-treated (cohort 3B) patients were enrolled. If nine or more of 35 (cohort 3A) or three or more of 25 (cohort 3B) had CNS objective response rates (ORR), the drug combination would be deemed promising. The primary end point was composite CNS ORR in each cohort separately, requiring a reduction of 50% or more in the sum of target CNS lesion volumes without progression of nontarget lesions, new lesions, escalating steroids, progressive neurologic signs or symptoms, or non-CNS progression.",
        "Results/Findings": "Forty-nine patients enrolled in cohorts 3A (n = 37) and 3B (n = 12; cohort closed for slow accrual). In cohort 3A, the composite CNS ORR = 49% (95% CI, 32% to 66%), and the CNS ORR in cohort 3B = 33% (95% CI, 10% to 65%). Median progression-free survival was 5.5 and 3.1 months in cohorts 3A and 3B, respectively; median survival was 13.3 and 15.1 months. Diarrhea was the most common grade 3 toxicity (29% in cohorts 3A and 3B).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neratinib plus capecitabine is active against refractory, HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases, adding additional evidence that the efficacy of HER2-directed therapy in the brain is enhanced by chemotherapy. For optimal tolerance, efforts to minimize diarrhea are warranted.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Evaluate the effects of radiotherapy after sector resection for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS) in patient groups as defined by age, size of the lesion, focality, completeness of excision and mode of detection.",
        "Methods": "A total of 1,067 women in Sweden were randomly assigned to either postoperative radiotherapy (RT) or control from 1987 to 1999, and 1,046 were followed for a mean of 8 years. The main outcome was new ipsilateral breast cancer events and distant metastasis-free survival analyzed according to intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 64 ipsilateral events in the RT arm and 141 in the control group corresponding to a risk reduction of 16.0 percentage points at 10 years (95% CI, 10.3% to 21.6%) and a relative risk of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54). There was no statistically significant difference in distant metastasis-free survival. There was an effect modification by age, yielding a low effect of RT in women younger than 50, but substantial protection in women older than 60 years. The age effect was not confounded by focality, lesion size, completeness of excision, or detection mode. There was no group as defined by our stratification variables that had a low risk without radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results indicate that younger women have a low protective effect of conventional RT after sector resection. Older women benefit substantially. We caution that the age effect was seen in a subgroup analysis. Further search with conventional clinical variables for a low risk group that does not need RT does not seem fruitful.",

        "Background/Purpose": "EndoPredict (EPclin) is a prognostic test validated to inform decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy alone for patients with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Here, we determine the performance of EPclin for estimating 10-year distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) rates for those who received adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) alone compared to those with chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy (ET + C).",
        "Methods": "A total of 3746 women were included in this joint analysis. 2630 patients received 5 years of ET alone (ABCSG-6/8, TransATAC) and 1116 patients received ET + C (GEICAM 2003-02/9906). The primary objective was to evaluate the ability of EPclin to provide an estimate of the 10-year DR rate as a continuous function of EPclin separately for ET alone and ET + C. Cox proportional hazard models were used for these analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "EPclin was highly prognostic for DR in women who received ET alone (HR 2.79 (2.49-3.13), P < 0.0001) as well as in those who received ET + C (HR 2.27 (1.99-2.59), P < 0.0001). Women who received ET + C had significantly smaller increases in 10-year DR rates with the increasing EPclin score than those receiving ET alone (EPclin = 5; 12% ET + C vs. 20% ET alone). We observed a significant positive interaction between EPclin and treatment groups (P-  = 0.022).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this comparative non-randomised analysis, the rate of increase in DR with EPclin score was significantly reduced in women who received ET + C versus ET alone. Our indirect comparisons suggest that a high EPclin score can predict chemotherapy benefit in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative disease.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Eighty-one female patients with phyllodes tumors of the breast, surgically treated from 1974 to 1983, were studied. Their age ranged from 9 to 88 years. According to histology, the series was divided into three groups, of 28 (34.5%) benign tumors, 32 (39.5%) border-line tumors, and 21 (25.9%) malignant tumors. Because ten patients were lost to follow-up, only 71 women could be evaluated. All the patients had received surgical treatment: 51 women had been treated conservatively (11 enucleations, 40 wide resections), and 20 had undergone radical operations (13 underwent total and five underwent subcutaneous mastectomies, whereas one underwent modified and one underwent radical mastectomy). The mean follow-up, for the three groups, was 106 months for benign, 84 months for borderline, and 82 months for malignant tumors; in no case was radical surgery followed by local recurrence: of 51 women conservatively treated, 14 experienced local relapse, i.e., one of 24 women with benign, ten of 22 with borderline, and three of 8 with malignant lesions. Only two of 47 patients (4.2%) with borderline or malignant tumors developed distant metastasis and died from disease. No relationship between tumor size and risk of local recurrence could be demonstrated, and no difference could be identified between borderline and malignant lesions, in terms both of local and distant relapse. Local recurrences do not appear to affect survival: as a consequence, wide resection should be the primary treatment. Enucleation is to be proscribed. Total mastectomy has been indicated for very large tumors and for local recurrences of borderline and malignant lesions. Axillary dissection is not worthwhile.",

Higher-risk women should start mammographic screening earlier and may benefit from supplemental screening modalities. For women with genetics-based increased risk (and their untested first-degree relatives), with a calculated lifetime risk of 20% or more or a history of chest or mantle radiation therapy at a young age, supplemental screening with contrast-enhanced breast MRI is recommended. Breast MRI is also recommended for women with personal histories of breast cancer and dense tissue, or those diagnosed by age 50. Others with histories of breast cancer and those with atypia at biopsy should consider additional surveillance with MRI, especially if other risk factors are present. Ultrasound can be considered for those who qualify for but cannot undergo MRI. All women, especially black women and those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, should be evaluated for breast cancer risk no later than age 30, so that those at higher risk can be identified and can benefit from supplemental screening.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2020) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2021). In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015-2019 by 0.6%-1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%-3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus-associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%-2% annually for cervical (ages 30-44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late-1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two-fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.",

        "Background/Purpose": "During recent years, an increasing number of patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and previous axillary surgery have undergone repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (rSLNB). The influence of axillary nodal status on prognosis for IBTR patients remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the technical success rate, follow-up assessment, and prognostic value of rSLNB for patients with IBTR.",
        "Methods": "A systematic search conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to July 2017 included all studies on rSLNB in IBTR.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 34 articles describing 1761 patients were identified. A repeat sentinel lymph node (rSLN) was successfully harvested from 64.3% of the patients with IBTR, and the rate was significantly higher for the patients who had a previous SLNB than for those who had a previous axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (75.7% vs. 46.1%; P < 0.0001). The rSLN was tumor-positive for 18.2% of the rSLNs, 40% of which were harvested in basins other than the ipsilateral axilla. The negative predictive value of the rSLNB was 96.5%. Overall survival, reported for 21.5% of the patients, was 95.2% after a mean follow-up period of 29.6 months.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The prognostic impact of rSLN-positive versus rSLN-negative IBTR remains unclear. Further studies are needed to fill in the gap in the management of lymph nodes for patients with IBTR. However, based on the current evidence, rSLNB is feasible for 64% of patients, especially after previous SLNB. With a negative predictive value of 96.5%, rSLNB appears to be highly specific, with substantial advantages over ipsilateral ALND in IBTR.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Ductal carcinoma in situ is currently managed with excision, radiotherapy, and adjuvant hormone therapy, usually tamoxifen. We postulated that an aromatase inhibitor would be safer and more effective. We therefore undertook this trial to compare anastrozole versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing lumpectomy plus radiotherapy.",
        "Methods": "The double-blind, randomised, phase 3 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-35 trial was done in 333 participating NSABP centres in the USA and Canada. Postmenopausal women with hormone-positive ductal carcinoma in situ treated by lumpectomy with clear resection margins and whole-breast irradiation were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral tamoxifen 20 mg per day (with matching placebo in place of anastrozole) or oral anastrozole 1 mg per day (with matching placebo in place of tamoxifen) for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by age (<60 vs ≥60 years) and patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was breast cancer-free interval, defined as time from randomisation to any breast cancer event (local, regional, or distant recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer, invasive disease, or ductal carcinoma in situ), analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and is complete.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 1, 2003, and June 15, 2006, 3104 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (1552 to tamoxifen and 1552 to anastrozole). As of Feb 28, 2015, follow-up information was available for 3083 patients for overall survival and 3077 for all other disease-free endpoints, with median follow-up of 9·0 years (IQR 8·2-10·0). In total, 212 breast cancer-free interval events occurred: 122 in the tamoxifen group and 90 in the anastrozole group (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·56-0·96], p=0·0234). A significant time-by-treatment interaction (p=0·0410) became evident later in the study. There was also a significant interaction between treatment and age group (p=0·0379), showing that anastrozole is superior only in women younger than 60 years of age. Adverse events did not differ between the groups, except for thrombosis or embolism--a known side-effect of tamoxifen-for which there were 17 grade 4 or worse events in the tamoxifen group versus four in the anastrozole group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole treatment provided a significant improvement in breast cancer-free interval, mainly in women younger than 60 years of age. This finding means that women will benefit from having a choice of effective agents for ductal carcinoma in situ.",

Since selected women with invasive cancer can be treated safely with breast conservation therapy it is paradoxical that total mastectomy has remained the standard treatment for DCIS. We did a randomised phase III clinical trial to investigate the role of radiotherapy after complete local excision of DCIS.",
        "Methods": "Between 1986 and 1996, women with clinically or mammographically detected DCIS measuring less than or equal to 5 cm were treated by complete local excision of the lesion and then randomly assigned to either no further treatment (n=503) or to radiotherapy (n=507; 50 Gy in 5 weeks to the whole breast). The median duration of follow-up was 4.25 years (maximum 12.0 years). All analyses were by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "500 patients were followed up in the no further treatment group and 502 in the radiotherapy group. In the no further treatment group 83 women had local recurrence (44 recurrences of DCIS, and 40 invasive breast cancer). In the radiotherapy group 53 women had local recurrences (29 recurrences of DCIS, and 24 invasive breast cancer). The 4-year local relapse-free was 84% in the group treated with local excision alone compared with 91% in the women treated by local excision plus radiotherapy (log rank p=0.005; hazard ratio 0.62).

Secondary end points were predictors for pCR, clinical response, rate of breast conservation, and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "A pCR was achieved in 94 patients (10.6%), but the likelihood was significantly greater with AC-DOC (14.3%; n = 63) than with ADOC (7.0%; n = 31) (odds ratio, 2.22; 90% CI, 1.52 to 3.24; P < .001). Independent predictors of attaining a pCR included the use of sequential therapy, high tumor grade, and negative hormone receptor status. The response rates detected by palpation and by imaging were significantly higher with AC-DOC (85.0% and 78.6%, respectively) than with ADOC (75.2% and 68.6%, respectively; both P values < .001).

        "Background/Purpose": "Discordance in estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptor status between the primary tumor and recurrence is frequently reported in the literature. This is frequently interpreted as evidence for a change in the biology of breast cancer during the course of the disease. This commentary discusses some of the caveats of this interpretation. Discordant receptor results can be caused by any of 3 factors: (a) a genuine switch in the biology of the disease, (b) sampling error in focally receptor-positive cancers, and (c) limited accuracy and reproducibility of receptor assays. The relative contribution of each of these factors to discordant results is unknown. A switch in molecular class between primary and recurrent cancer (or residual cancer after therapy) appears to be a rare event based on the available limited molecular profiling data. Small pockets of strongly focally receptor-positive tumor nests in a larger receptor-negative cancer are also relatively infrequently seen. Discordance resulting from inherent limitations in assay reproducibility is evident from the frequently discordant receptor results even when the same samples are assessed in different laboratories (e.g., central versus local laboratory). A repeat tumor biopsy is clearly justified when it is suspected, on clinical grounds, that the original receptor results may have been false negative or when the diagnosis of metastatic disease is in question. However, routine repeat biopsy for receptor re-evaluation does not necessarily improve diagnostic accuracy and have a potential to harm through a false-negative result. For patients with clinical courses consistent with hormone responsiveness, or with prior positive hormone receptor results, a course of endocrine therapy is reasonable regardless of the most recent hormone receptor assay result.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Differences in hormone receptor and HER-2 status between primary tumour and corresponding relapse could have a substantial impact on clinical management of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate change in expression of hormone receptors and HER-2 status between primary tumour and corresponding local recurrence or distant metastasis. We analysed 140 primary tumours and related recurrent or metastatic samples. Hormone receptors status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, while HER-2 status by immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridisation. A change in HER-2 was rare; 3.7% of cases by immunohistochemistry and only 0.7% by silver in situ hybridisation analysis. A change in estrogen and progesterone receptors was seen in 6.4% and 21.4% of cases, respectively. Estrogen receptor change was not affected by adjuvant therapy, whereas progesterone receptor was influenced by adjuvant chemotherapy associated to hormone therapy (P = 0.0005). A change in progesterone receptor was more frequent in distant metastases than in local recurrences (P = 0.03). In the setting of estrogen receptor positive tumours, patients with progesterone receptor loss in local recurrence had a statistically significant lower median metastasis free survival compared to others patients; progesterone receptor positive, 112 months; progesterone receptor negative, 24 months (P = 0.005). A change between primary tumour and corresponding relapse is frequent for progesterone receptor, infrequent for estrogen receptor and rare for HER-2. In cases with changes in HER-2, it is worthwhile reassessing HER-2 status with both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation analysis. Progesterone receptor loss seems to be influenced by therapy and to correlate with a worse prognosis.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite their widespread use in metastatic bone disease, some bisphosphonate drugs are associated with adverse events (AEs), particularly renal toxicity, adding to treatment burdens and increasing healthcare costs. Ibandronic acid is a single-nitrogen bisphosphonate with high efficacy against bone events and metastatic bone pain, and a renal safety profile compar- able to that of placebo. In this study, the safety of ibandronic acid was examined over a period of 4 years.",
        "Methods": "During an initial 96-week period, breast cancer patients with bone metastases were randomised in double-blind fashion to placebo or ibandronic acid 6mg administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours every 3-4 weeks as part of a previously reported phase III trial (MF 4265 study). All patients completing the phase III trial were offered open-label active treatment for a further 96 weeks (extension phase). A total of 62 patients received ibandronic acid 6mg in this extension phase and were classified according to their initial treatment (placebo/ibandronic acid 6mg [placebo/6mg] and ibandronic acid 6mg/ibandronic acid 6mg [6mg/6mg] groups). Safety was assessed by AE reports and clinical laboratory evaluations.",
        "Results/Findings": "During the 4-year study, most patients experienced at least one AE, with malignancy progression being most commonly reported. However, fewer treatment-related AEs were reported in the extension phase (placebo/6mg: 6.3% [1/16]; 6mg/6mg: 13.0% [6/46]) than in the initial phase of the study (placebo: 56.3% [9/16]; 6mg: 67.4% [31/46]). Serious AEs were mainly due to malignancy progression. There were no clinically relevant renal AEs, and in both groups, serum creatinine levels were similar for up to 4 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This 96-week open-label safety extension of a phase III, placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that long-term use of intravenous ibandronic acid is well tolerated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite the potential aesthetic and psychological benefits of total skin-sparing mastectomy (TSSM) with preservation of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) skin, there is still reluctance to use the technique due to concern for increased recurrence rates or higher postoperative complication rates. The rapidly expanding literature describing outcomes after TSSM enables a comprehensive review of recurrence rates and surgical complications.",
        "Methods": "Studies describing nipple-sparing or TSSM were identified from the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. Studies that reported oncologic outcomes and/or data on postoperative complications were included.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-seven studies were identified that met inclusion criteria, representing a total of 3331 mastectomies. Review of oncologic outcomes in the 10 studies (representing 1148 mastectomies) with documented mean/median follow-up of 2 years demonstrated an overall local-regional recurrence rate of 2.8%. Ischemic complications involving the NAC were reported in 24 studies (representing 3091 mastectomies), with 9.1% of cases reported to have some degree of NAC necrosis and 2.0% of cases complicated by complete necrosis leading to NAC loss. Sixteen studies (representing 2213 mastectomies) reported rates of skin flap necrosis, which occurred in 9.5% of cases. Eighty-one percent of the total cases reviewed involved expander-implant reconstruction; in the 16 studies (representing 2343 reconstructions) that reported outcomes after expander-implant reconstruction, overall expander-implant loss was 3.4%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "There is now a significant body of literature demonstrating low rates of early local-regional recurrence and postoperative complications after TSSM. These data support the use of TSSM techniques, which improve psychological and aesthetic outcomes without compromising therapeutic efficacy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite increased demand for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM), the survival benefit of this procedure remains uncertain.",
        "Methods": "We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify 107 106 women with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy for treatment between 1998 and 2003 and a subset of 8902 women who also underwent CPM during the same period. Associations between predictor variables and the likelihood of undergoing CPM were evaluated by use of chi(2) analyses. Risk-stratified (estrogen receptor [ER] status, stage, and age) adjusted survival analyses were performed by using Cox regression. Statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "In a univariate analysis, CPM was associated with improved disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] of death = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57 to 0.69; P < .001). Risk-stratified analysis showed that this association was because of a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality in women aged 18-49 years with stages I-II ER-negative cancer (HR of death = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.88; P = .004). Five year-adjusted breast cancer survival for this group was improved with CPM vs without (88.5% vs 83.7%, difference = 4.8%). Although rates of contralateral breast cancer among young women with stages I-II disease undergoing CPM were independent of ER status, women with ER-positive tumors in the absence of prophylactic mastectomy also had a lower overall risk for contralateral breast cancer than women with ER-negative tumors (0.46% vs 0.90%, difference = 0.44%; P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "CPM is associated with a small improvement in 5-year breast cancer-specific survival mainly in young women with early-stage ER-negative breast cancer. This effect is related to a higher baseline risk of contralateral breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Despite guidelines recommending against its routine use, perioperative imaging for distant metastases is frequently performed in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, uncovering incidental findings of uncertain significance. We assessed the clinical significance of incidental findings by determining if their presence is associated with disease recurrence. A retrospective review of staging imaging was performed in patients with stage II or III invasive breast cancer diagnosed during 2008-2009 at a large academic medical center. Data related to perioperative imaging and disease recurrence were abstracted from the medical record. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between incidental findings and time to disease recurrence. A total of 169 of 340 patients (49.7 %) underwent staging evaluation for distant metastases (CT chest, abdomen, pelvis, bone scan, and/or PET-CT). Of these, 146 (86.4 %) had at least one suspicious or indeterminate finding. Follow-up studies were performed in 73 (43.2 %) patients. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease at diagnosis, 18 of whom had stage III disease. In patients without metastatic disease at diagnosis, 32 later developed recurrence. Non-calcified pulmonary nodules were associated with shorter time to disease recurrence (hazard ratio 2.51, 95 % CI 1.13-5.57, p = 0.02). Imaging for distant metastases frequently reveals indeterminate findings, most of which are not associated with disease recurrence. The association between pulmonary nodules and recurrence warrants validation in an independent cohort. Overall, these findings support current guidelines recommending against routine extent of disease evaluation in patients with newly diagnosed stage II breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Dermatitis is a frequent adverse effect of adjuvant breast radiotherapy. It is more likely in full-breasted women and when the radiation is distributed nonhomogeneously in the breast. Breast intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a technique that ensures a more homogeneous dose distribution.",
        "Methods": "A multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was performed to test if breast IMRT would reduce the rate of acute skin reaction (notably moist desquamation), decrease pain, and improve quality of life compared with standard radiotherapy using wedges. Patients were assessed each week during and up to 6 weeks after radiotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned between July 2003 and March 2005 in two Canadian centers, and 331 were included in the analysis. Breast IMRT significantly improved the dose distribution compared with standard radiation. This translated into a lower proportion of patients experiencing moist desquamation during or up to 6 weeks after their radiation treatment; 31.2% with IMRT compared with 47.8% with standard treatment (P = .002). A multivariate analysis found the use of breast IMRT (P = .003) and smaller breast size (P < .001) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of moist desquamation. The use of IMRT did not correlate with pain and quality of life, but the presence of moist desquamation did significantly correlate with pain (P = .002) and a reduced quality of life (P = .003).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast IMRT significantly reduced the occurrence of moist desquamation compared with a standard wedged technique. Moist desquamation was correlated with increased pain and reduction in the quality of life.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Decisions about systemic treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer are often based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and Her2 status of the primary tumor. This study prospectively investigated concordance in receptor status between primary tumor and distant metastases and assessed the impact of any discordance on patient management.",
        "Methods": "Biopsies of suspected metastatic lesions were obtained from patients and analyzed for ER/PgR and Her2. Receptor status was compared for metastases and primary tumors. Questionnaires were completed by the oncologist before and after biopsy to determine whether the biopsy results changed the treatment plan.",
        "Results/Findings": "Forty women were enrolled; 35 of them underwent biopsy, yielding 29 samples sufficient for analysis; 3/29 biopsies (10%) showed benign disease. Changes in hormone receptor status were observed in 40% (P = 0.003) and in Her2 status in 8% of women. Biopsy results led to a change of management in 20% of patients (P = 0.002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This prospective study demonstrates the presence of substantial discordance in receptor status between primary tumor and metastases, which led to altered management in 20% of cases.

        "Background/Purpose": "Debate regarding the benefit of radiotherapy after local excision of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) continues. The Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) is thought to be a useful aid in deciding which patients are at increased risk of local recurrence and who may benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Recently published interim data from the Sloane project has showed that the VNPI score did significantly affect the chances of getting planned radiotherapy in the UK, suggesting that British clinicians may already be using this scoring system to assist in decision making. This paper independently assesses the prognostic validity of the VNPI in a British population.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective review was conducted of all patients (n = 215) who underwent breast conserving surgery for DCIS at a single institution between 1997-2006. No patients included in the study received additional radiotherapy or hormonal treatment. Kaplan Meier survival curves were calculated, to determine disease free survival, for the total sample and a series of univariate analyses were performed to examine the value of various prognostic factors including the VNPI. The log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance of differential survival rates. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to analyze the significance of the individual components of the VNPI. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software, version 14.5.",
        "Results/Findings": "The mean follow-up period was 53 months (range 12-97, SD19.9). Ninety five tumours were high grade (44%) and 84 tumours exhibited comedo necrosis (39%). The closest mean initial excision margin was 2.4 mm (range 0-22 mm, standard deviation 2.8) and a total of 72 tumours (33%) underwent further re-excision. The observed and the actuarial 8 year disease-free survival rates in this study were 91% and 83% respectively. The VNPI score and the presence of comedo necrosis were the only statistically significant prognostic indicators (P < 0.05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This follow-up study of 215 patients with DCIS treated with local excision and observation alone is one of the largest series in which rates of recurrence are unaffected by radiation therapy, hormone manipulation or chemotherapy. It has afforded us the opportunity to assess the prognostic impact of patient and tumour characteristics free of any potentially confounding treatment related influences. The results suggest that the VNPI can be used to identify a subset of patients who are at risk of local recurrence and who may potentially benefit from RT.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Data suggest that the adjuvant use of bisphosphonates reduces rates of recurrence and death in patients with early-stage breast cancer. We conducted a study to determine whether treatment with zoledronic acid, in addition to standard adjuvant therapy, would improve disease outcomes in such patients.",
        "Methods": "In this open-label phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 3360 patients to receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy either with or without zoledronic acid. The zoledronic acid was administered every 3 to 4 weeks for 6 doses and then every 3 to 6 months to complete 5 years of treatment. The primary end point of the study was disease-free survival. A second interim analysis revealed that a prespecified boundary for lack of benefit had been crossed.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 59 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the primary end point, with a rate of disease-free survival of 77% in each group (adjusted hazard ratio in the zoledronic acid group, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.13; P=0.79). Disease recurrence or death occurred in 377 patients in the zoledronic acid group and 375 of those in the control group. The numbers of deaths--243 in the zoledronic acid group and 276 in the control group--were also similar, resulting in rates of overall survival of 85.4% in the zoledronic acid group and 83.1% in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.01; P=0.07). In the zoledronic acid group, there were 17 confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (cumulative incidence, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.7; P<0.001) and 9 suspected cases; there were no cases in the control group. Rates of other adverse effects were similar in the two study groups.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a rare sarcoma of the breast. Although surgical removal is the mainstay of treatment, the extent of surgery required (excision vs. mastectomy) and the need for additional local therapy, such as radiotherapy, are unclear. The current study evaluated the rate of local and distant failure, as well as potential prognostic factors, to better define appropriate treatment strategies.",
        "Methods": "One hundred one patients treated primarily for cystosarcoma phyllodes of the breast were evaluated. These tumors were classified histologically into benign (58%), indeterminate (12%), and malignant (30%) based on well defined criteria. Stromal overgrowth (29%) was considered separately. Surgery was comprised of local excision with breast conservation (47%) or mastectomy (53%). Microscopic surgical margins were negative in 99% of cases. Six patients received adjuvant radiotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall survival for the 101 patients was 88%, 79%, and 62% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. For patients with nonmalignant (benign or indeterminate) and malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes, the overall survival was 91% and 82%, respectively, at 5 years, and 79% and 42%, respectively, at 10 years. Similar rates were observed based on the presence or absence of stromal overgrowth. Local recurrence occurred in 4 patients, with an actuarial 10-year rate of 8%. Eight patients developed distant metastases, with an actuarial 10-year rate of 13%. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression revealed stromal overgrowth to be the only independent predictor of distant failure.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Local failure in this group of largely margin negative patients with cystosarcoma phyllodes of the breast was low, showing that breast-conserving surgery with appropriate margins is the preferred primary therapy. The current study data do not support the use of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with adequately resected disease. Patients with stromal overgrowth, particularly when the tumor size was > 5 cm, were found to have a high rate of distant failure; such patients merit consideration of a trial that examines the efficacy of systemic therapy.",

A recent review suggested that surgery may improve long-term survival in such patients. We evaluated the effect of surgery in such patients on long-term survival and disease progression.",
        "Methods": "We reviewed the records of all breast cancer patients treated at our institution between 1997 and 2002 who presented with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor. Information collected included demographics, tumor characteristics, site(s) of metastases, type/date of operation, use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, disease progression (time to progression and location of progression) in the first year after diagnosis, and last follow-up. Overall and metastatic progression-free survival were compared between surgery and nonsurgery patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 224 patients identified, 82 (37%) underwent surgical extirpation of the primary tumor (segmental mastectomy in 39 [48%] and mastectomy in 43 [52%]), and 142 (63%) were treated without surgery. The median follow-up time was 32.1 months. After adjustment for other covariates, surgery was associated with a trend toward improvement in overall survival (P=.12; relative risk, .50; 95% confidence interval, .21-1.19) and a significant improvement in metastatic progression-free survival (P=.0007; relative risk, .54; 95% confidence interval, .38-.77).",

        "Background/Purpose": "Currently, the clinical role of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (CT) in patients with breast cancer is to provide additional information in select scenarios in which results of conventional imaging are indeterminate or of limited utility. There is currently no clinical role for fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in detection of breast cancer or evaluation of axillary lymph nodes, but these are areas of active research. FDG PET is complementary to conventional staging procedures and should not be a replacement for either bone scintigraphy or diagnostic CT. FDG PET and PET/CT have been shown to be particularly useful in the restaging of breast cancer, in evaluation of response to therapy, and as a problem-solving method when results of conventional imaging are equivocal. In these situations, FDG PET often demonstrates locoregional or unsuspected distant disease that affects management. PET has demonstrated a particular capability for evaluation of chemotherapy response in both patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma and those with metastatic disease.",

In multivariable and IPTW models, partial mastectomy alone, total mastectomy alone, and total mastectomy with RT were associated with worse OS compared with BCT (p < 0.001 all). Ten-year OS was 73.8% for BCT and 56.3, 58.0 and 56.3% for other treatment approaches. Older age, higher T/N stage, histological grade, and triple-negative receptor status were associated with poorer OS (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis by stage demonstrated similar results.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this national sample of male breast cancer patients, BCT was associated with greater survival. The underlying mechanisms of this association warrant further study, because more routine adoption of BCT in male breast cancer appears to translate into clinically meaningful improvements in survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for breast cancer staging include pre-treatment complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFT) to screen for occult metastatic disease. To date, the relevance of these tests in detecting metastatic disease in asymptomatic women with early-stage breast cancer (Stage I/II) has not been demonstrated. Although chest x-rays are no longer recommended in the NCCN guidelines, many centers continue to include this imaging as part of their screening process. We aim to determine the clinical and financial impact of these labs and x-rays in the evaluation of early-stage breast cancer patients. A single institution IRB-approved retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with biopsy-proven invasive breast cancer treated from January 1, 2005–December 31, 2009. We collected patient demographics, clinical and pathologic staging, chest x-ray, CBC, and LFT results at the time of referral. Patients were stratified according to radiographic stage at the time of diagnosis. We obtained Medicare reimbursement fees for cost analysis. From 2005 to 2009, 1609 patients with biopsy-proven invasive breast cancer were treated at our institution. Of the 1082 patients with radiographic stage I/II disease, 27.3 % of patients had abnormal CBCs. No additional testing was performed to evaluate these abnormalities. In the early-stage population, 24.7 % of patients had elevated LFTs, resulting in 84 additional imaging studies. No metastatic disease was detected. The cost of CBC, LFTs and chest x-rays was $110.20 per patient, totaling $106,410.99. Additional tests prompted by abnormal results cost $58,143.30 over the five-year period. We found that pre-treatment CBCs, LFTs, and chest x-rays did not improve detection of occult metastatic disease but resulted in additional financial costs. Avoiding routine ordering of these tests would save the US healthcare system $25.7 million annually.",

This trial evaluated the effect of adding lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole as first-line treatment of hormone receptor (HR) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC were randomly assigned to daily letrozole (2.5 mg orally) plus lapatinib (1,500 mg orally) or letrozole and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the HER2-positive population. Results In HR-positive, HER2-positive patients (n = 219), addition of lapatinib to letrozole significantly reduced the risk of disease progression versus letrozole-placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .019); median PFS was 8.2 v 3.0 months, respectively. Clinical benefit (responsive or stable disease >or= 6 months) was significantly greater for lapatinib-letrozole versus letrozole-placebo (48% v 29%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8; P = .003). Patients with centrally confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors (n = 952) had no improvement in PFS. A preplanned Cox regression analysis identified prior antiestrogen therapy as a significant factor in the HER2-negative population; a nonsignificant trend toward prolonged PFS for lapatinib-letrozole was seen in patients who experienced relapse less than 6 months since prior tamoxifen discontinuation (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P = .117). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common in the lapatinib-letrozole arm versus letrozole-placebo arm (diarrhea, 10% v 1%; rash, 1% v 0%, respectively), but they were manageable.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Controversy exists as to the treatment regimen necessary to best provide optimal local control for inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC). This study was conducted to determine if mastectomy combined with radiotherapy offered any advantages over radiotherapy alone in patients with IBC who had been treated with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective review of 178 women treated for IBC on doxorubicin-based multimodality therapy protocols between January 1974 and September 1993 was performed. Clinical and histologic response to treatment, time to local recurrence, survival, and ultimate control of local disease were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine survival and relapse times, and Fisher's exact test was used to test differences in treatment outcomes. Significance was determined at p < or = 0.05.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up was 89 months (range 22 to 223 months). Locoregional disease persisted in seven patients and recurred in 44 patients who had been rendered disease free at a median time of 10 months. The mortality rate after a local recurrence (LR) was 98%, and all patients but one with LR developed systemic metastases. Response to induction chemotherapy influenced the incidence of LR, and the amount of residual disease found on histologic examination of mastectomy specimens was highly prognostic for local failure. Patients who underwent mastectomy in addition to radiotherapy had a lower incidence of LR than did patients who received radiotherapy alone (16.3% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.015).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of mastectomy to combination chemotherapy plus radiotherapy improved local control in patients with IBC. The addition of mastectomy to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy improved distant disease-free and overall survival in patients with a clinical complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy. Patients who had no significant response to induction chemotherapy received no survival or local disease-control benefit from the addition of mastectomy to their treatment regimen. These patients should be considered for entry into clinical trials of new treatment regimens.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively new but increasingly used modality for the detection of breast cancer. MRI has demonstrated utility in identifying additional tumor foci and extent of disease in patients with known breast cancer. This is especially useful with invasive lobular carcinoma, which is difficult to evaluate on mammography. MRI has been found to identify the primary tumor in 70% to 86% of cases of occult breast cancer. Contrast-enhanced breast MRI has shown some usefulness in the detection of residual cancer following surgery but is limited by postoperative changes. In patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy, breast MRI is most accurate in those patients in whom there is little or no response to chemotherapy. The use of contrast-enhanced breast MRlfor breast cancer screening is controversial. It has only been used in afew small studies of high-risk patients. The limitations of breast MRI include uptake in benign lesions and normal tissue, sensitivity for ductal carcinoma in situ, cost, and availability. This paper will discuss the uses, benefits, and limitations of contrast-enhanced breast MRI in the staging and screening of breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) refers to removal of the opposite uninvolved breast in women with unilateral breast cancer, and rates are increasing worldwide. In observational studies, CPM is often associated with reductions in breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality when compared to unilateral surgical treatment alone, but this may reflect selection of a healthier cohort for CPM (selection bias). To further explore this possibility, we examined the association between CPM and non-cancer mortality, an indicator of selection bias. We identified 449,178 adult women diagnosed with unilateral, primary American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I-III ductal or lobular breast cancer, utilizing the 1998-2010 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. Of these, 5.8% (n = 25,961) underwent CPM as their first course of treatment. We examined associations between CPM and breast cancer-specific, all-cause, and non-cancer mortality utilizing multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age, race, AJCC stage, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, and histologic grade of the tumor. Among all patients receiving CPM as first course of treatment, CPM was associated with lower breast cancer-specific [HR 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.89)], all-cause [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.88)], and non-cancer [HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.64-0.80)] 5-year hazard of death. Although our results are consistent with other observational studies showing associations between CPM and reductions in breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, we demonstrate an even stronger association between CPM and reduced non-cancer mortality. Thus, the reported associations between CPM and reductions in mortality might at least partly be attributable to selection bias.",

We estimated life expectancy (LE) gain, 20-year overall survival, and disease-free survival with each intervention strategy among cohorts of women defined by age, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and stage of cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "Predicted LE gain from CPM ranged from 0.13 to 0.59 years for women with stage I breast cancer and 0.08 to 0.29 years for those with stage II breast cancer. Absolute 20-year survival differences ranged from 0.56% to 0.94% for women with stage I breast cancer and 0.36% to 0.61% for women with stage II breast cancer. CPM was more beneficial among younger women, stage I, and ER-negative breast cancer. Sensitivity analyses yielded a maximum 20-year survival difference with CPM of only 1.45%.",

        "Methods": "From 2003 through 2004, 1170 expander/implant reconstructions were performed at a single center. A prospectively maintained database was reviewed. Variables including age, smoking status, body mass index, history of diabetes, hypertension, chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as timing and laterality of reconstruction were evaluated. The primary endpoint was the development of a complication; the secondary endpoint was failure of reconstruction.",
        "Results/Findings": "Over the 2 year study period, 1170 expander/implant reconstructions were performed in 884 patients. The odds of developing complications was 2.2 times greater in smokers (p < 0.001) and 2.5 times greater in women over 65 (p = 0.008). Patients who were obese were at nearly two times the odds of having complications (p = 0.02), as were patients with hypertension (p = 0.02). Similarly, the odds of reconstructive failure were five times greater in smokers (p < 0.001). Age was not a significant predictor of reconstructive failure (p = 0.09); yet, failure was nearly seven times greater in obese patients (p < 0.001), and four more times likely in those who were hypertensive (p = 0.005).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Smoking, obesity, hypertension, and age over 65 were independent risk factors for perioperative complications following expander/implant breast reconstruction.

        "Background/Purpose": "Combined modality therapy has become the treatment of choice for patients with primary breast cancer, including those with locally advanced breast cancer. Primary or induction chemotherapy, followed by surgery or radiation therapy or both, and adjuvant systemic therapy is a generally accepted strategy. Most tumors respond with a more than 50% decrease in tumor size, and approximately 70% of patients experience down-staging through primary chemotherapy. Breast conservation is possible for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and almost all patients initially are rendered disease free. Primary chemotherapy should be the initial choice of treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors, but it is unclear what the optimal sequence of subsequent therapies should be, or whether one or two local treatment modalities are necessary. The most dramatic example of the efficacy of these regimens was demonstrated in patients with inflammatory breast cancer. Previously a universally fatal condition, the natural history of this disease has been changed dramatically by the introduction of these combined modality therapies. Five-year survival rates of 35-60% commonly are reported, and it is likely that about one third of patients with this highly aggressive form of disease will survive beyond 10 years without recurrence. Combined modality therapy that includes primary chemotherapy provides appropriate local control, the possibility of breast conservation therapy, and, probably, an increased survival rate, at least for some subsets of patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The use of similar treatment strategies for early breast cancer is currently under evaluation. Hormone therapy and combination chemotherapy represent the main treatment approaches to metastatic breast cancer. Radiotherapy is also a useful palliative tool, especially for control of painful bone metastases and central nervous system involvement. Patient and tumor characteristics help in the optimal selection of systemic therapy. Palliative therapy for symptomatic control and prolongation of life also preserves a good quality of life. Dose-intensive chemotherapy is being evaluated as a treatment to increase complete response rates and cause remission consolidation. Clinical trials on several new and effective cytotoxic agents, as well as new hormonal compounds, are being completed and are showing encouraging preliminary results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

For ABCSG Trial 6a, patients who were disease free at the end of Trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment. Efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided P values and Kaplan-Meier curves, and tolerability data were estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",
        "Results/Findings": "ABCSG Trial 6a included 856 patients. At a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who received anastrozole (n = 387) had a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with women who received no further treatment (n = 469; hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.96, P = .031). Anastrozole was well tolerated, and no unexpected adverse events were reported.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data confirm the benefit of extending adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years with anastrozole compared with no further treatment. Further research is required to define the optimum length of extended adjuvant therapy and to investigate the possibility of tailoring this period to suit different disease types.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent, potentially long-lasting side effect of select chemotherapies. It contributes to suboptimal chemotherapy dosing, and its symptoms negatively impact patients' quality of life. To date, interventions to effectively prevent this toxicity have not been established, and interventions to treat CIPN have produced only modest results. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine the impact of regional cooling applied to distal extremities on the severity of CIPN. A literature review was performed using SCOPUS and PubMed databases. The search was not restricted by date but was restricted to English language. Forty-two articles were identified in the search, and six were included in the review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results related to protective effects from peripheral cooling against CIPN were variable. Four out of six studies demonstrated benefit of peripheral cooling in reducing the severity of CIPN. There was evidence to suggest that applying a relatively greater degree of cooling compared with a lesser degree may confer benefit in reducing the severity of CIPN. Both direct application of cooling and use of compression to achieve fingertip cooling showed potential benefit.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a common and distressing adverse effect of many types of chemotherapy. Scalp cooling has been used since the 1970s for prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia; however, most data regarding this treatment modality are retrospective in nature, and use in the United States has been limited by safety concerns, specifically the potential for scalp metastases. Two prospective studies of scalp-cooling systems performed in the United States were published within the last year and add evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of scalp cooling in preventing chemotherapy-induced alopecia in patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumor malignancies. Available data suggest that this technology is most effective for taxane-based chemotherapy regimens compared with anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Two scalp-cooling devices have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration, and multiple cold caps are available for patient rental. The adverse effect profile of scalp cooling includes scalp pain, headache, and chills but is tolerable for most patients included in recent clinical trials. Retrospective data suggest that the incidence of scalp metastases related to scalp cooling is low and should not limit use of this technology. Logistic issues related to use of scalp cooling include availability of devices, inconsistent insurance coverage, and incorporation of use into typical infusion center workflow.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) affects the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy (CT) for early breast cancer. It is a highly distressing side effect of CT, with psychological and social impact. Primary aim of the present analysis was to assess the efficacy of scalp cooling with DigniCap® in preventing CIA. Success rate was defined as patients' self-reported hair loss <50% according to Dean scale. In this analysis, we reported success rate at 3 weeks after the first CT course and at 3 weeks after the last CT course. Secondary endpoints included self-reported tolerability and patients' judgment on scalp cooling performance. Consecutive early breast cancer patients admitted to Istituto Oncologico Veneto who were recommended to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant CT, were eligible to undergo scalp cooling during the CT administration within this study. 135 patients were included: 74% received adjuvant CT and 26% neoadjuvant CT (P < .001). The type of CT was: docetaxel-cyclophosphamide (26%), paclitaxel (23%), epirubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (32%), and paclitaxel followed by epirubicincyclophosphamide (19%). The rate of success in preventing alopecia was 77% (104/135) at 3 weeks from the start of CT and 60% (81/135) at 3 weeks from the end of treatment. Higher success rates were reported in non-anthracycline (71%) compared to anthracycline-containing CT regimens (54%; P < 0.001). Premature discontinuation of scalp cooling was reported in 29/135 patients (21.5%), including withdrawal for alopecia (16/29), for low scalp cooling tolerability (8/29) or both (5/29). Scalp cooling was generally well tolerated. These results overall suggest that the use of scalp cooling is effective in preventing alopecia in the majority of early breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant CT, especially for patients undergoing a taxane-based non-anthracycline regimen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Cardiac dysfunction (CD) is a recognized risk associated with the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer, especially when the treatment regimen includes anthracyclines. Given the demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab, ongoing assessment of cardiac safety and identification of risk factors for CD are important for optimal patient care.",
        "Methods": "In National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31, a phase III adjuvant trial, 1,830 patients who met eligibility criteria for initiation of trastuzumab were evaluated for CD. Recovery from CD was also assessed. A statistical model was developed to estimate the risk of severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Baseline patient characteristics associated with anthracycline-related decline in cardiac function were also identified.",
        "Results/Findings": "At 7-year follow-up, 37 (4.0%) of 944 patients who received trastuzumab experienced a cardiac event (CE) versus 10 (1.3%) of 743 patients in the control arm. One cardiac-related death has occurred in each arm of the protocol. A Cardiac Risk Score, calculated using patient age and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by multiple-gated acquisition scan, statistically correlates with the risk of a CE. After stopping trastuzumab, the majority of patients who experienced CD recovered LVEF in the normal range, although some decline from baseline often persists. Only two CEs occurred more than 2 years after initiation of trastuzumab.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The late development of CHF after the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide chemotherapy is uncommon. The risk versus benefit of trastuzumab as given in this regimen remains strongly in favor of trastuzumab.",

Surgery was divided in two main cohorts (primary BCT, primary MTX) and five subcohorts. Analyses were stratified into T1N0M0, T2N0M0, T1N1M0, T2N1M0, and age groups (<50, 50-69, ≥70). Overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were calculated in life tables, hazard ratios by Cox regression, and sensitivity analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "Five-year BCSS for women who underwent primary BCT or primary MTX was 97 and 88 %, respectively.

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to identify residual and additional disease in patients with invasive carcinoma. The use of MRI in assessing extent of disease for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is less well defined. This study assessed the value of MRI in the preoperative evaluation of DCIS.",
        "Methods": "We identified 98 patients with DCIS in 2007. Of these, 63 underwent stereotactic biopsy, followed by MRI. There were 35 who underwent stereotactic biopsy alone. Concordance between MRI and histopathology was defined as the presence or absence of residual disease.",

In patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), there were fewer positive margins in the MRI versus the non-MRI group (21.2% vs 30.8%, P = .41). Of the 64 cases that underwent preoperative MRI, 43 (67.2%) were concordant. Also, 15 of 43 cases (34.8%) had MRI results that accurately predicted pathologic size. In 28 of 43 patients (65.2%), MRI overestimated disease in 20, by a mean of 1.97 cm. In patients with MRI tumor size >2 cm, MRI overestimated disease by a mean of 3.17 cm. Of the 64 cases, 21 (32.8%) were discordant. Also, 10 of 21 (47.6%) had a positive MRI and no residual disease on histopathology, and 11 of 21 (52.3%) had negative MRI and residual disease on pathology.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "MRI does not accurately predict extent of disease in patients with extensive DCIS. In patients with MRI tumor size < or = 2 cm, MRI may assist in surgical planning. MRI results in patients with DCIS should be interpreted with caution; decision for mastectomy should not be made on MRI findings alone.",

Because axillary node dissection (AND) has a low yield, some have argued for its omission. The present study was undertaken to determine factors that correlated with omission of AND, and the impact of the decision to omit AND on 10-year relative survival.",
        "Methods": "A retrospective review of National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data for 547,847 women with Stage I and Stage II breast cancer treated in US hospitals from 1985 to 1995 was undertaken. A subset of 47,944 Stage I and 23,283 Stage II women treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was identified. Cross-tab analysis was used to compare patterns of surgical care within this subset. Relative survival was calculated as the ratio of observed survival to the expected survival for women of the same age and racial/ethnic background.",
        "Results/Findings": "The rate of BCS with and without AND increased steadily from 17.6% and 6.4% of patients from 1985-1989, to 36.6% and 10.6% of patients from 1993-1995 respectively. AND was more likely to be omitted in women with Stage I than women with Stage II disease (14.5% versus 5.5%). Similarly, AND was omitted more frequently in women with Grade 1 than women with higher grades (Grade 1, 14.9%; Grade 2, 10.1%; Grade 3, 7.1%; Grade 4, 7%). Although the rate of BCS with AND varied considerably according to location in the breast, the overall rate of BCS without AND appeared independent of site of lesion. Women over the age of 70 years were more than twice as likely to have AND omitted from BCS than their younger counterparts. Women with lower incomes, women treated in the Northeast, or at hospitals with annual caseloads <150 were all less likely to undergo AND than their corresponding counterparts. Ten-year relative survival for Stage I women treated with partial mastectomy and AND was 85% (n = 1242) versus 66% (n = 1684) for comparable women in whom AND was omitted. BCS with AND followed by radiation therapy for Stage I disease resulted in 94% (n = 5469) 10-year relative survival, compared with 85% (n = 1284) without AND. Addition of both radiation and chemotherapy to BCS with AND for Stage I disease resulted in 86% (n = 2800) versus 58% (n = 512) without AND. In contrast, Stage II women treated with BCS with AND followed by radiation and chemotherapy experienced a 72% 10-year relative survival.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A significant number of women with Stage I breast cancer do not undergo AND as part of BCS. The trend is most pronounced for the elderly, but significant fractions of women of all ages are also being undertreated by current standards. Ten-year survival is significantly worse when AND is omitted. This adverse survival effect is not solely from understaging.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast carcinoma is one of the most common carcinomas in pregnant women. The incidence of breast carcinoma may increase in the future because of the trend toward delayed childbearing and increased screening. However, very few contemporary studies have attempted to identify the combined histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of breast carcinoma in these patients.",
        "Methods": "The authors evaluated 39 patients with breast carcinoma occurring coincident with pregnancy. This was comprised of a critical histologic review and immunohistochemical evaluation to determine the status of prognostic and predictive markers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2/neu, Ki-67, and p53.",
        "Results/Findings": "The mean age at presentation was 33 years (range, 24-44 years). Densities and/or masses were noted on mammograms in 14 of 16 patients with available radiographic information. The primary tumors were a mean of 4.5 cm in greatest dimension (range, 0.1-13.5 cm). Two of the 39 patients had clinical (American Joint Committee on Cancer) Stage I disease, 19 patients had Stage II disease, 16 had Stage III disease, and 2 patients had Stage IV disease at the time of presentation. Histologically, high-grade invasive ductal carcinomas were found in 32 of 38 patients. The primary tumor was not available for review in one patient. A predominantly solid pattern of growth was observed in nine patients. Lymphovascular invasion was identified in 61% of cases. Ductal carcinoma in situ was identified in 72% of tumors and was high grade in all cases. Of the 25 patients tested, ER positivity was found in 7 patients, PR positivity was found in 6 patients, HER-2/neu positivity was found in 7 patients, and p53 positivity was found in 12 patients. The proliferation rate as shown by Ki-67 staining was high in 60% of the cases. Follow-up information was available for 35 patients and the mean follow-up period was 43 months (range, 2-163 months). Distant metastasis occurred in seven patients. The mean time to disease recurrence was 20.4 months (range, 10-33 months). Of 35 patients, 4 have died, 22 were alive with no evidence of disease, and 9 were alive with disease at the last follow-up. The remaining four patients died of unknown causes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Pregnant women with breast carcinomas generally present with advanced-stage disease and the tumors have poor histologic and prognostic features. The findings from the follow-up indicated that these tumors do not follow a very aggressive clinical course as was proposed in earlier reports. Breast carcinomas occurring during pregnancy share many histologic and prognostic similarities with breast carcinoma occurring in other young women.",

We report the epidemiology, pathology, clinical picture, therapeutic management and foetal outcome of pregnant women with breast cancer treated in our institution.",
        "Methods": "Twenty-two pregnant breast cancer patients were treated in our hospital from January 1996 to October 2006. Parents were surveyed by mail or telephone regarding outcomes of children exposed to chemotherapy in uterus.",
        "Results/Findings": "The treatment of breast cancer pregnancy should conform as closely as possible to standardised protocols for patients without concomitant pregnancy. Most of the patients underwent surgery during pregnancy In four cases diagnosed during the first trimester chemotherapy was initiated during the 10th week when organogenesis period was finished. None of the children exposed to chemotherapy during this trimester presented congenital malformations.

The purpose of the current study was to determine long-term outcome in patients achieving a pCR of cytologically proven inflammatory breast carcinoma ALN metastases after primary chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "Patients with cytologically documented ALN metastases from inflammatory breast carcinoma were treated in three prospective primary chemotherapy trials. After surgery, patients were subdivided into those patients with and those patients without residual ALN carcinoma. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 175 patients treated, 61 had cytologically confirmed ALN metastases. Fourteen patients (23%) achieved a pCR of the ALNs after primary chemotherapy. The 5-year OS and RFS rates were found to be improved in those patients achieving a pCR of the ALNs (82.5% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 62.8-100%] and 78.6% [95%CI, 59.8-100%], respectively, vs. 37.1% [95%CI, 25.4-54.2%] and 25.4% [95%CI, 15.5-41.5%], respectively) (P = 0.01 [for OS] and P = 0.001 [for RFS]). Combination anthracycline and taxane-based primary chemotherapy resulted in significantly more patients achieving an ALN pCR (45% vs. 16%; P = 0.01).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "pCR of ALN metastases is associated with an excellent prognosis in patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma. The rates of ALN pCR are nearly 50% in patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma who are treated with anthracyclines and weekly paclitaxel before surgery. However, those patients with residual ALN disease at the time of surgery greatly require the introduction of novel therapeutic strategies.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women in the United States, and for nearly all with metastatic disease at presentation or relapse it will be incurable. The goals of therapy are to optimize quality of life and, if possible, prolong time to progression of disease and death. For a select group of patients an aggressive surgical approach may be considered. Initial palliation with endocrine therapy should be the primary consideration for patients with metastatic hormone receptor-positive tumors. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is appropriate for those with hormone-refractory disease, rapidly progressive visceral disease, or early relapse after adjuvant therapy. If a tumor overexpresses HER2, targeted treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) or lapatinib (Tykerb) is possible. Consequently, accurate determination of the status of these predictive markers in tissue (possibly from a recurrence site) is key. Other novel agents are adding to the wide choices of standard chemotherapies already available. This review offers an approach to the selection of individualized and rational therapies for patients with metastatic breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer is the most common neoplasm in women and accounts for 26% (182,460) of all new cancer cases among women. With the use of screening mammography and advancement in other diagnostic modalities, many cases of breast cancer now can be diagnosed and treated at early stages of the disease. Unfortunately, adjuvant chemotherapy regimens commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer may cause premature ovarian failure due to their cytotoxic effects on the germ cells in the ovary. Therefore preservation of fertility in breast cancer survivors at reproductive age has become an important quality of life issue. Fertility preservation is a recently emerged field of reproductive medicine that may help protect the reproductive capability of the cancer survivors and allow them to have children in the future. Embryo freezing is the most established fertility preservation strategy. But conventional ovarian stimulation protocols are contraindicated in breast cancer patients because of the rise of estrogen and its metabolites to supraphysiological levels. Recently developed ovarian stimulation protocols with aromatase inhibitor letrozole and tamoxifen appear to provide a safe stimulation with endogenous estrogen levels comparable with those achieved in the natural cycle. Oocyte freezing can be considered in single women and in those who do not wish donor sperm. Ovarian tissue freezing could also be an option in breast cancer patients who do not wish or have a time for an in vitro fertilization cycle, which requires 10 to 14 days of ovarian stimulation.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women younger than age 50 years. Cancer treatments in younger women may cause premature menopause, infertility, and negative psychosocial effects. In this systematic review, we examined three key domains of functioning that are particularly relevant for younger breast cancer survivors: health-related quality of life (QOL), menopausal symptoms and fertility concerns, and behavioral health outcomes.",
        "Methods": "We conducted a literature review using PubMed and secondary sources and examined 840 articles published between January 1990 and July 2010. Inclusion criteria for articles were 1) published in English after 1989; 2) exclusively analyzed female breast cancer survivors aged 50 years or younger or premenopausal at diagnosis, with baseline characteristics and/or quantitative or descriptive analyses for this age group; 3) investigated QOL (health-related QOL including physical functioning and mental health, depression, and anxiety), menopause- or fertility-related concerns, and weight gain or physical activity-related behavioral health outcomes. Data were extracted using a standardized table collecting the purpose, design, population, and results of each study. Extracted data were reviewed for accuracy by two investigators and presented as descriptive tables.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 28 articles met the inclusion criteria (15 cross-sectional studies, eight longitudinal studies, and five randomized trials). Regarding data review, no discordance between investigators was noted. Standardized measures of QOL and depressive symptoms identified worse outcomes as being more frequent or severe in breast cancer survivors aged 50 years or younger when compared with the general age-matched population of women without cancer and to older women (aged >50 years) with breast cancer. Concerns about premature menopause, menopausal symptoms, and infertility were common in younger women (aged ≤ 50 years) and had a role in the level of distress after treatment. Weight gain and physical inactivity were common health outcomes in younger women.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Younger women with breast cancer were found to experience distinct psychosocial and menopause-related concerns, weight gain, and physical inactivity.

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developed countries, and 12% of breast cancer occurs in women 20-34 years. Survival from breast cancer has significantly improved, and the potential late effects of treatment and the impact on quality of life have become increasingly important. Young women constitute a minority of breast cancer patients, but commonly have distinct concerns and issues compared with older women, including queries regarding fertility, contraception and pregnancy. Further, they are more likely than older women to have questions regarding potential side effects of therapy and risk of relapse or a new primary. In addition, many will have symptoms associated with treatment and they present a management challenge. Reproductive medicine specialists and gynaecologists commonly see these women either shortly after initial diagnosis or following adjuvant therapy and should be aware of current management of breast cancer, the options for women at increased genetic risk, the prognosis of patients with early stage breast cancer and how adjuvant systemic treatments may impact reproductive function.",
        "Methods": "No systematic literature search was done. The review focuses on the current management of breast cancer in young women and the impact of treatment on reproductive function and subsequent management. With reference to key studies and meta-analyses, we highlight controversies and current unanswered questions regarding patient management.",
        "Results/Findings": "Chemotherapy for breast cancer is likely to negatively impact on reproductive function. A number of interventions are available which may increase the likelihood of future successful pregnancy, but the relative safety of these interventions is not well established. For those who do conceive following breast cancer, there is no good evidence that pregnancy is detrimental to survival. We review current treatment; effects on reproductive function; preservation of fertility; contraception; pregnancy; breastfeeding and management of menopausal symptoms following breast cancer.",

Whereas only one report studied the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel (Taxol) during pregnancy, several preclinical reports indicate that the placental P-glycoprotein could prevent the transplacental transfer of taxanes and vinorelbine. The use of trastuzumab was associated with the occurrence of anhydramnios in three of six cases.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The administration of recent drugs taxanes and vinorelbine seems feasible during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, with a favorable toxicity profile.

        "Background/Purpose": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained using DNA microarrays have revealed previously indistinguishable subtypes of noninflammatory breast cancer (NIBC) related to different features of mammary epithelial biology and significantly associated with survival. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, particular, and aggressive form of disease. Here we have investigated whether the five molecular subtypes described for NIBC (luminal A and B, basal, ERBB2 overexpressing, and normal breast-like) were also present in IBC. We monitored the RNA expression of approximately 8,000 genes in 83 breast tissue samples including 37 IBC, 44 NIBC, and 2 normal breast samples. Hierarchical clustering identified the five subtypes of breast cancer in both NIBC and IBC samples. These subtypes were highly similar to those defined in previous studies and associated with similar histoclinical features. The robustness of this classification was confirmed by the use of both alternative gene set and analysis method, and the results were corroborated at the protein level. Furthermore, we show that the differences in gene expression between NIBC and IBC and between IBC with and without pathologic complete response that we have recently reported persist in each subtype. Our results show that the expression signatures defining molecular subtypes of NIBC are also present in IBC. Obtained using different patient series and different microarray platforms, they reinforce confidence in the expression-based molecular taxonomy but also give evidence for its universality in breast cancer, independently of a specific clinical form.",

Recommendations suggest treating men who are diagnosed with breast cancer using the guidelines for postmenopausal women; however, to date, no population-based studies have evaluated patterns of care.",
        "Methods": "To examine characteristics, treatment, and survival among men with newly diagnosed breast cancer, in 2003 and 2004, 512 men were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Data were reabstracted and therapy was verified through the patients' treating physicians.",
        "Results/Findings": "The majority of men (79%) were diagnosed through discovery of a breast lump or other signs/symptoms. Among men who had invasive disease, 86% underwent mastectomy, 37% received chemotherapy, and 58% received hormone therapy. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (P=.01) and positive lymph node status (P<.0001) were associated positively with the use of chemotherapy, whereas age group (P<.0001) and current unmarried status (P=.01) had negative associations. Among men who had invasive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/borderline tumors, the use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) was associated with age group (P=.05). Among men who had invasive disease, cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P<.0001). Among men with ER-positive/borderline disease, increased cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P<.0001), current unmarried status (P=.04), and decreased mortality with tamoxifen (P=.04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tumor characteristics and marital status were the primary predictors of therapy and cancer mortality among men with breast cancer. Although AIs are not currently recommended, they are commonly prescribed. However, their use did not result in a decrease in cancer mortality.

        "Background/Purpose": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations are associated with a strong risk of breast cancer, which may preclude breast-conserving treatment in carriers. This study examined whether mutation status influenced the rate of breast cancer recurrence following breast-conserving treatment. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were screened for germline mutations in 131 patients with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, who had been treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy. The 131 patients with familial history were matched to 261 patients without, according to age at diagnosis and year of treatment. The follow-up of controls was at least equal to the time-interval between diagnosis and genetic testing in familial cases. Matched cohorts were compared according to rates of breast cancer recurrence as first event and contralateral breast cancer using log-rank tests. BRCA1/2 mutations were found in 20.6% patients with a family history. Nineteen patients had a BRCA1 mutation and 8 had a BRCA2 mutation. Breast cancers in mutation carriers were more often grade III (p<10-4) and oestrogen receptor negative (p=0.005) than tumours in both non-carriers and controls. Median follow-up for all 392 patients was 8.75 years. No significant differences in breast cancer recurrence as first event were seen between BRCA1/2 tumours and controls (p=0.47), carriers and non-carriers with a family history (p=0.96), or non-carriers and controls (p=0.10). On multivariate analysis, age was the most important factor significantly predicting for breast cancer recurrence. The rate of contralateral breast cancer was significantly increased in all patients with a family history: BRCA1/2 carriers versus controls (p=0.0003), non-carriers versus controls (p=0.0034) and carriers versus non-carriers (p=0.02). At a 9-year median follow-up, the rate of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence was not higher in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers than in non-carriers with a family history or sporadic cases. These results support the hypothesis that breast tumours in BRCA carriers are more sensitive to radiation. Therefore, breast-conserving treatment can be offered to these patients. However, longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the rate of new primary cancer in the treated breast does not increase in the long-term.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Bone scanning (BS), liver ultrasonography (LUS) and chest radiography (CXR) are commonly used in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer as part of baseline staging. However, in the absence of symptomatic disease, the usefulness of this routine diagnostic work-up is not evidence-based.",
        "Methods": "We selected the study sample from 516 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer. For each diagnostic test (BS, LUS, CXR), we analyzed the prevalence defined as the number of patients with diagnosis of metastatic disease after an imaging technique divided by the total number of patients tested. In addition, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Initial suspicion was confirmed by other independent tests (bone X-ray, computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) in order to identify \"true\" positive diagnoses.",
        "Results/Findings": "At baseline, BS was carried out in 412 patients, LUS in 412 patients and CXR in 428 patients. Thirty-three patients were correctly diagnosed by the initial staging investigations as having metastatic disease (true positive cases). BS detected skeletal metastases in 6.31% of patients, LUS detected liver metastases in 0.72% of patients and CXR detected lung metastases in 0.93% of patients. Before imaging tests, all patients with either LUS or CXR evidence of metastases were previously classified as having stage III disease. On the other hand, only 26.9% of bone metastases were detected in patients with stage III. Accordingly, the detection rate in stage III patients was 14%, 5.6% and 7.2%, respectively for BS, LUS and CXR.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These findings indicate that a complete diagnostic work-up to detect metastases is unnecessary in the majority of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, whereas it may be indicated for specific patient categories such as those with stage III disease.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Bone metastases occur in most women with advanced breast cancer and can lead to considerable morbidity and a rapid deterioration in the patient's quality of life. It was the aim of the present study to assess changes in quality of life and bone pain due to intravenous (i.v.) ibandronate, a potent third-generation bisphosphonate. In a phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, 466 women were randomised to receive placebo, 2 mg ibandronate or 6 mg ibandronate for up to 96 weeks. Treatment was administered i.v. at 3- or 4-weekly intervals. Clinical endpoints included the incidence of adverse events, quality of life (assessed using the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Scale - Core 30 questionnaire (QLQ-C30)), and bone pain (assessed on a 5-point scale from 0=none to 4=intolerable). Ibandronate was generally well tolerated. Compared with baseline measurements, the bone pain score was increased at the last assessment in both the placebo and 2 mg ibandronate groups, but was significantly reduced in the patients receiving 6 mg ibandronate (-0.28+/-1.11, P < 0.001). A significant improvement in quality of life was demonstrated for patients treated with ibandronate (P < 0.05) for all global health status. Overall, at the last assessment, the 6 mg ibandronate group showed significantly better functioning compared with placebo (P = 0.004), and had significantly better scores on the domains of physical, emotional, and social functioning, and in global health status (P < 0.05). Significant improvements in the symptoms of fatigue and pain were also observed in the 6 mg ibandronate group. I.v. ibandronate treatment leads to significant improvements in quality of life, and is an effective and well-tolerated palliative treatment in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer.",

Risk factors for osteoporosis are increased in patients with cancer, including women with chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, those treated with aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer, men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, and patients undergoing glucocorticoid therapy. The skeleton is a common site of metastatic cancer recurrence, and skeletal-related events are the cause of significant morbidity. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) convened a multidisciplinary task force on Bone Health in Cancer Care to discuss the progress made in identifying effective screening and therapeutic options for management of treatment-related bone loss; understanding the factors that result in bone metastases; managing skeletal metastases; and evolving strategies to reduce bone recurrences.

        "Methods": "Women with stage IV breast cancer who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and had at least one lytic bone lesion were given either placebo or pamidronate (90 mg) as a two-hour intravenous infusion monthly for 12 cycles. Skeletal complications, including pathologic fractures, the need for radiation to bone or bone surgery, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia (a serum calcium concentration above 12 mg per deciliter [3.0 mmol per liter] or elevated to any degree and requiring treatment), were assessed monthly. Bone pain, use of analgesic drugs, performance status, and quality of life were assessed throughout the trial.",
        "Results/Findings": "The efficacy of treatment was evaluated in 380 of 382 randomized patients, 185 receiving pamidronate and 195 receiving placebo. The median time to the occurrence of the first skeletal complication was greater in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group (13.1 vs. 7.0 months, P=0.005), and the proportion of patients in whom any skeletal complication occurred was lower (43 percent vs. 56 percent, P = 0.008). There was significantly less increase in bone pain (P=0.046) and deterioration of performance status (P=0.027) in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group. Pamidronate was well tolerated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Bisphosphonates have profound effects on bone physiology, and could modify the process of metastasis. We undertook collaborative meta-analyses to clarify the risks and benefits of adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment in breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "We sought individual patient data from all unconfounded trials in early breast cancer that randomised between bisphosphonate and control. Primary outcomes were recurrence, distant recurrence, and breast cancer mortality. Primary subgroup investigations were site of first distant recurrence (bone or other), menopausal status (postmenopausal [combining natural and artificial] or not), and bisphosphonate class (aminobisphosphonate [eg, zoledronic acid, ibandronate, pamidronate] or other [ie, clodronate]). Intention-to-treat log-rank methods yielded bisphosphonate versus control first-event rate ratios (RRs).",
        "Results/Findings": "We received data on 18,766 women (18,206 [97%] in trials of 2-5 years of bisphosphonate) with median follow-up 5·6 woman-years, 3453 first recurrences, and 2106 subsequent deaths. Overall, the reductions in recurrence (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·87-1·01; 2p=0·08), distant recurrence (0·92, 0·85-0·99; 2p=0·03), and breast cancer mortality (0·91, 0·83-0·99; 2p=0·04) were of only borderline significance, but the reduction in bone recurrence was more definite (0·83, 0·73-0·94; 2p=0·004). Among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11 767 postmenopausal women it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·78-0·94; 2p=0·002), distant recurrence (0·82, 0·74-0·92; 2p=0·0003), bone recurrence (0·72, 0·60-0·86; 2p=0·0002), and breast cancer mortality (0·82, 0·73-0·93; 2p=0·002). Even for bone recurrence, however, the heterogeneity of benefit was barely significant by menopausal status (2p=0·06 for trend with menopausal status) or age (2p=0·03), and it was non-significant by bisphosphonate class, treatment schedule, oestrogen receptor status, nodes, tumour grade, or concomitant chemotherapy. No differences were seen in non-breast cancer mortality. Bone fractures were reduced (RR 0·85, 95% CI 0·75-0·97; 2p=0·02).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adjuvant bisphosphonates reduce the rate of breast cancer recurrence in the bone and improve breast cancer survival, but there is definite benefit only in women who were postmenopausal when treatment began.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Biomarkers to optimize extended adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer are limited. The HOXB13/IL17BR (H/I) biomarker predicts recurrence risk in ER-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. H/I was evaluated in MA.17 trial for prognostic performance for late recurrence and treatment benefit from extended adjuvant letrozole.",
        "Methods": "A prospective-retrospective, nested case-control design of 83 recurrences matched to 166 nonrecurrences from letrozole- and placebo-treated patients within MA.17 was conducted. Expression of H/I within primary tumors was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with a prespecified cutpoint. The predictive ability of H/I for ascertaining benefit from letrozole was determined using multivariable conditional logistic regression including standard clinicopathological factors as covariates. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "High H/I was statistically significantly associated with a decrease in late recurrence in patients receiving extended letrozole therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16 to 0.75; P = .007). In an adjusted model with standard clinicopathological factors, high H/I remained statistically significantly associated with patient benefit from letrozole (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.73; P = .006). Reduction in the absolute risk of recurrence at 5 years was 16.5% for patients with high H/I (P = .007). The interaction between H/I and letrozole treatment was statistically significant (P = .03).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In the absence of extended letrozole therapy, high H/I identifies a subgroup of ER-positive patients disease-free after 5 years of tamoxifen who are at risk for late recurrence. When extended endocrine therapy with letrozole is prescribed, high H/I predicts benefit from therapy and a decreased probability of late disease recurrence.",

We compared the prognostic ability of the breast-cancer index (BCI) assay, 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX), and an immunohistochemical prognostic model (IHC4) for both early and late recurrence in patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive, node-negative (N0) disease who took part in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) clinical trial.",
        "Methods": "In this prospective comparison study, we obtained archival tumour blocks from the TransATAC tissue bank from all postmenopausal patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer from whom the 21-gene recurrence score and IHC4 values had already been derived. We did BCI analysis in matched samples with sufficient residual RNA using two BCI models-cubic (BCI-C) and linear (BCI-L)-using previously validated cutoffs. We assessed prognostic ability of BCI for distant recurrence over 10 years (the primary endpoint) and compared it with that of the 21-gene recurrence score and IHC4. We also tested the ability of the assays to predict early (0-5 years) and late (5-10 years) distant recurrence. To assess the ability of the biomarkers to predict recurrence beyond standard clinicopathological variables, we calculated the change in the likelihood-ratio χ(2) (LR-Δχ(2)) from Cox proportional hazards models.",
        "Results/Findings": "Suitable tissue was available from 665 patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive, N0 breast cancer for BCI analysis. The primary analysis showed significant differences in risk of distant recurrence over 10 years in the categorical BCI-C risk groups (p<0·0001) with 6·8% (95% CI 4·4-10·0) of patients in the low-risk group, 17·3% (12·0-24·7) in the intermediate group, and 22·2% (15·3-31·5) in the high-risk group having distant recurrence. The secondary analysis showed that BCI-L was a much stronger predictor for overall (0-10 year) distant recurrence compared with BCI-C (interquartile HR 2·30 [95% CI 1·62-3·27]; LR-Δχ(2)=22·69; p<0·0001). When compared with BCI-L, the 21-gene recurrence score was less predictive (HR 1·48 [95% CI 1·22-1·78]; LR-Δχ(2)=13·68; p=0·0002) and IHC4 was similar (HR 1·69 [95% CI 1·51-2·56]; LR-Δχ(2)=22·83; p<0·0001). All further analyses were done with the BCI-L model. In a multivariable analysis, all assays had significant prognostic ability for early distant recurrence (BCI-L HR 2·77 [95% CI 1·63-4·70], LR-Δχ(2)=15·42, p<0·0001; 21-gene recurrence score HR 1·80 [1·42-2·29], LR-Δχ(2)=18·48, p<0·0001; IHC4 HR 2·90 [2·01-4·18], LR-Δχ(2)=29·14, p<0·0001); however, only BCI-L was significant for late distant recurrence (BCI-L HR 1·95 [95% CI 1·22-3·14], LR-Δχ(2)=7·97, p=0·0048; 21-gene recurrence score HR 1·13 [0·82-1·56], LR-Δχ(2)=0·48, p=0·47; IHC4 HR 1·30 [0·88-1·94], LR-Δχ(2)=1·59, p=0·20).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "BCI-L was the only significant prognostic test for risk of both early and late distant recurrence and identified two risk populations for each timeframe. It could help to identify patients at high risk for late distant recurrence who might benefit from extended endocrine or other therapy.",

Here, we report the effects of diagnosis and treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 2 years.",
        "Methods": "The BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 trial is ongoing at 118 hospitals in 11 countries. Women aged 18 years or older with completely excised non-low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned, by use of a minimisation algorithm, to tumour bed boost or no tumour bed boost, following conventional whole breast radiotherapy or hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using one of three randomisation categories. Category A was a 4-arm randomisation of tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) versus hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy (42·5 Gy in 16 fractions over 3·5 weeks). Category B was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy, and category C was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. Stratification factors were age at diagnosis, planned endocrine therapy, and treating centre. The primary endpoint, time to local recurrence, will be reported when participants have completed 5 years of follow-up. The HRQOL statistical analysis plan prespecified eight aspects of HRQOL, assessed by four questionnaires at baseline, end of treatment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after radiotherapy: fatigue and physical functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30); cosmetic status, breast-specific symptoms, arm and shoulder functional status (Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale); body image and sexuality (Body Image Scale); and perceived risk of invasive breast cancer (Cancer Worry Scale and a study-specific question). For each of these measures, tumour bed boost was compared with no boost, and conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy, by use of generalised estimating equation models. Analyses were by intention to treat, with Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between June 1, 2007, and Aug 14, 2013, 1208 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive no tumour bed boost (n=605) or tumour bed boost (n=603). 396 of 1208 women were assigned to category A: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=100) or no boost (n=98), or to hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=98) or no boost (n=100). 447 were assigned to category B: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=223) or no boost (n=224). 365 were assigned to category C: hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=182) or no boost (n=183). All patients were followed up at 2 years for the HRQOL analysis. 1098 (91%) of 1208 patients received their allocated treatment, and most completed their scheduled HRQOL assessments (1147 [95%] of 1208 at baseline; 988 [87%] of 1141 at 2 years). Cosmetic status was worse with tumour bed boost than with no boost across all timepoints (difference 0·10 [95% CI 0·05-0·15], global p=0·00014, Hochberg-adjusted p=0·0016); at the end of treatment, the estimated difference between tumour bed boost and no boost was 0·13 (95% CI 0·06-0·20; p=0·00021), persisting at 24 months (0·13 [0·06-0·20]; p=0·00021). Arm and shoulder function was also adversely affected by tumour bed boost across all timepoints (0·08 [95% CI 0·03-0·13], global p=0·0033, Hochberg adjusted p=0·045); the difference between tumour bed boost and no boost at the end of treatment was 0·08 (0·01 to 0·15, p=0·021), and did not persist at 24 months (0·04 [-0·03 to 0·11], p=0·29). None of the other six prespecified aspects of HRQOL differed significantly after adjustment for multiple testing. Conventional whole breast radiotherapy was associated with worse body image than hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy at the end of treatment (difference -1·10 [95% CI -1·79 to -0·42], p=0·0016). No significant differences were reported in the other PROs between conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Between February 1993 and September 1995, 739 patients with metastatic breast cancer were entered on an Intergroup trial (E1193) comparing doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)), paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/24 h), and the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AT, 50 mg/m(2) and 150 mg/m(2)/24 h, plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 mg/kg) as first-line therapy. Patients receiving single-agent doxorubicin or paclitaxel were crossed over to the other agent at time of progression.",
        "Methods": "Patients were well balanced for on-study characteristics.",
        "Results/Findings": "Responses (complete response and partial response) were seen in 36% of doxorubicin, 34% of paclitaxel, and 47% of AT patients (P =.84 for doxorubicin v paclitaxel, P =.007 for v AT, P =.004 for paclitaxel v AT). Median time to treatment failure (TTF) is 5.8, 6.0, and 8.0 months for doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and AT, respectively (P =.68 for doxorubicin v paclitaxel, P =.003 for doxorubicin v AT, P =.009 for paclitaxel v AT). Median survivals are 18.9 months for patients taking doxorubicin, 22.2 months for patients taking paclitaxel, and 22.0 months for patients taking AT (P = not significant). Responses were seen in 20% of patients crossing from doxorubicin --> paclitaxel and 22% of patients crossing from paclitaxel --> doxorubicin (P = not significant). Changes in global quality-of-life measurements from on-study to week 16 were similar in all three groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "(1) doxorubicin and paclitaxel, in the doses used here, have equivalent activity; (2) the combination of AT results in superior overall response rates and time to TTF; and (3) despite these results, combination therapy with AT did not improve either survival or quality of life compared to sequential single-agent therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Between 1960 and 1980, 518 patients with T1, T2, N0, N1a, invasive breast cancer were treated by limited surgery at Institute Curie with (183 patients) or without (335 patients) axillary node dissection, followed by radiation therapy to breast and nodes. Median follow-up was 8.6 years (1.3 to 25 years). Fifty-six breast recurrences occurred, including 49 breast recurrences alone, 3 simultaneous breast and node recurrences, and 4 simultaneous breast recurrences and metastasis. Five-year, 10-year, and 15-year actuarial risks of breast recurrences were 7 +/- 1%, 11 +/- 1.5%, and 18 +/- 3%, respectively. Univariate analysis of 14 clinical and pathological prognostic factors revealed that local control in breast was significantly impaired by young age, premenopausal status, inadequate gross surgical excision, extensive ductal in situ component, and endolymphatic extension. On multivariate analysis with a Cox regression model, the most important contributors to local breast control in order of importance were age (p less than 10(-4), relative risk = 2.44), adequacy of surgery (p = 0.003, relative risk = 2.78), and endolymphatic extension (p = 0.03, relative risk = 2.98). The 5-year actuarial survival rate following breast recurrence was 73%, and was significantly worse when breast recurrence occurred in the first 3 years after treatment: 44% versus 87%, respectively (p less than 0.01). This study confirms the relationship between young age and low breast control rates, and demonstrates the importance of adequate initial surgical procedures. It emphasizes the adverse prognosis of early breast recurrences as compared to the relatively favorable outcome of late recurrences.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Because of its morbidity and chronicity, arm lymphedema remains a concerning complication of breast cancer treatment. Although massage-based decongestive therapy is often recommended, randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated benefit over more conservative measures.",
        "Methods": "Women previously treated for breast cancer with lymphedema were enrolled from six institutions. Volumes were calculated from circumference measurements. Patients with a minimum of 10% volume difference between their arms were randomly assigned to either compression garments (control) or daily manual lymphatic drainage and bandaging followed by compression garments (experimental). The primary outcome was percent reduction in excess arm volume from baseline to 6 weeks.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 103 women were randomly assigned, and 95 were evaluable.

        "Background/Purpose": "Background There are limited data from clinical trials describing preoperative MRI features and performance in the evaluation of mammographically detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Purpose To report qualitative MRI features of DCIS, MRI performance in the identification of additional disease, and associations of imaging features with pathologic, genomic, and surgical outcomes from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) E4112 trial. Materials and Methods Secondary analyses of a multicenter prospective clinical trial from the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group included women with DCIS diagnosed with conventional imaging techniques (mammography and US), confirmed via core-needle biopsy (CNB), and enrolled between March 2015 and April 2016 who were candidates for wide local excision (WLE) based on conventional imaging and clinical examination results. DCIS MRI features and pathologic features from CNB and excision were recorded. Each woman without invasive upgrade of the index DCIS at WLE received a 12-gene DCIS score. MRI performance metrics were calculated. Associations of imaging features with invasive upgrade, dichotomized DCIS score (<39 vs ≥39), and single WLE success were estimated in uni- and multivariable analyses. Results Among 339 women (median age, 60 years; interquartile range, 51-66 years), most DCIS cases showed nonmass enhancement (NME) (195 of 339 [58%]) on MRI scans with larger median size than on mammograms (19 mm vs 12 mm;   < .001). Positive predictive value of MRI-prompted CNBs was 32% (21 of 66) (95% CI: 22, 44), yielding an additional cancer detection rate of 6.2% (21 of 339) (95% CI: 4.1, 9.3). MRI false-positive rate was 14.2% (45 of 318) (95% CI: 10.7, 18.4). No imaging features were associated with invasive upgrade or DCIS score (  = .05 to   = .95). Smaller size and focal NME distribution at MRI were linked to single WLE success (  < .001). Conclusion Preoperative MRI depicted ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed with conventional imaging most commonly as nonmass enhancement, with larger median span than mammography, and additional cancer detection rate of 6.2%. MRI features of this subset of DCIS did not enable prediction of pathologic or genomic outcomes. Clinical trial registration no.   © RSNA, 2021   See also the editorial by Kuhl in this issue.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Background Male breast cancer incidence is rising. There may be a potential role in selective screening in men at elevated risk for breast cancer, but the effectiveness of such screening remains unexplored. Purpose To evaluate patterns of male breast imaging utilization, to determine high-risk screening outcomes, and to delineate risk factors associated with cancer diagnosis. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed consecutive male breast imaging examinations over a 12-year period (between 2005-2017). Examination indications, biopsy recommendations, and pathologic results were correlated with patient characteristics. Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 1869 men (median age, 55 years; range, 18-96 years) underwent 2052 examinations yielding 2304 breast lesions and resulting in 149 (6.5%) biopsies in 133 men; 41 (27.5%) were malignant and 108 (72.5%) were benign. There were 1781 (86.8%) diagnostic and 271 (13.2%) screening examinations. All men undergoing screening had personal or family history of breast cancer and/or genetic mutations. There was a significant increase in the number of examinations in men relative to the number of examinations in women over time (Spearman correlation,   = 0.85;   < .001). Five node-negative cancers resulted from screening mammography, yielding a cancer detection rate of 18 per 1000 examinations (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7, 41), with cancers diagnosed on average after 4 person-years of screening (range, 1-10 person-years). Mammographic screening sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of biopsy were 100% (95% CI: 50%, 100%), 95.0% (95% CI: 93.1%, 98%), and 50% (95% CI: 22.2%, 77.8%). Older age (  < .001), Ashkenazi descent (  < .001), genetic mutations (  = .006), personal history (  < .001), and first-degree family history (  = .03) were associated with breast cancer. Non-first-degree family history was not associated with cancer (  = .09). Conclusion There is potential benefit in screening men at high risk for developing breast cancer. Such screening may have increased over time. © RSNA, 2019.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Axillary metastatic lymphadenopathy with no primary tumour identified in the breast on physical examination, mammography or ultrasound is referred to as occult breast cancer. The goal of this systematic review is to give an overview of the value and additional considerations of using breast MRI in occult breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "The databases of Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane library were searched for studies addressing the use of breast MRI in occult breast cancer. Cross-referencing was used to find additional articles.",
        "Results/Findings": "8 retrospective studies were included. Breast MRI can detect an otherwise occult breast cancer in more than two thirds of patients with a high sensitivity but lower specificity. In 80% of patients MRI detected lesions could be localized again by using ultrasound. Furthermore the size and localization of the lesions found on MRI most often correlated closely with findings at pathology. Breast MRI also provided the possibility of breast conserving surgery in one thirds of patients.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI can result in additional detection of otherwise occult lesions in occult breast cancer. Because of low specificity of malignant lesion detection by breast MRI, lesions should be histologically confirmed. This can be achieved either by MRI or ultrasound guided biopsy, as long as all MRI detected lesions are histologically checked. Routine application of breast MRI in occult breast cancer may also alter locoregional treatment by offering the possibility of breast conserving surgery in one thirds of patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Axillary metastasis from an occult breast carcinoma is an uncommon presentation and presents a therapeutic dilemma. The objective of this study is to describe the presenting clinical features, management approach and treatment outcomes for occult breast carcinoma. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who presented with axillary nodal metastases from an occult breast carcinoma between 1997 and 2004 at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute; 2,150 patients were diagnosed and treated for breast cancer during this period. After excluding stage I and IV patients, we identified 642 who had disease metastatic to lymph nodes, 10 of these had no primary tumor in the breast despite a thorough evaluation including bilateral mammography and breast ultrasound. Of these, 7 had undergone breast magnetic resonance imaging as well. All patients underwent axillary nodal dissection. The breast was managed with radiotherapy alone in 8 patients, wide local excision with radiation therapy in 1 patient and 1 patient underwent mastectomy. No patient had a recurrence with a median 57 months of follow-up. Breast conservation with radiation therapy alone can be considered as a management option for women with occult breast cancer presenting with axillary nodal metastasis.",

        "Methods": "Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to fulvestrant 500 mg administered as two 5-mL intramuscular injections on days 0, 14, and 28 and every 28 (±3) days thereafter or fulvestrant 250 mg administered as two 5-mL intramuscular injections (one fulvestrant and one placebo [identical in appearance to study drug]) on days 0, 14 (two placebo injections only), and 28 and every 28 (±3) days thereafter. OS was analyzed using an unadjusted log-rank test. No adjustments were made for multiplicity. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and best response to subsequent therapy were also reported. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "In total, 736 women (median age = 61.0 years) were randomly assigned to fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 362) or 250 mg (n = 374). At the final survival analysis, 554 of 736 (75.3%) patients had died. Median OS was 26.4 months for fulvestrant 500 mg and 22.3 months for 250 mg (hazard ratio = 0.81; 95% confidence interval = 0.69-0.96; nominal P = .02). There were no clinically important differences in SAE profiles between the treatment groups; no clustering of SAEs could be detected in either treatment group. Type of first subsequent therapy and objective responses to first subsequent therapy were well balanced between the two treatment groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, fulvestrant 500 mg is associated with a 19% reduction in risk of death and a 4.1-month difference in median OS compared with fulvestrant 250 mg. Fulvestrant 500 mg was well tolerated, and no new safety concerns were identified.",

The current report provides 10- and 15-year rates of tumor control in the breast, as well as disease-free and overall survival rates following BCS and RT in a cohort of patients with Paget disease presenting without a palpable mass or mammographic density.",
        "Methods": "Through a collaborative review of patients treated with BCS and RT from seven institutions, 38 cases of Paget disease of the breast presenting without a palpable mass or mammographic density were identified. All patients had pathologic confirmation of typical Paget cells at time of diagnosis. Thirty-six of 38 patients had a minimum follow-up greater than 12 months and constitute the study cohort. Ninety-four percent of patients underwent complete or partial excision of the nipple-areola complex and all patients received a median external beam irradiation dose of 50 Gy (range, 45-54 Gy) to the whole breast. Ninety-seven percent of patients also received a boost to the remaining nipple or tumor bed, a median total dose of 61.5 Gy (range, 50.4-70 Gy).",
        "Results/Findings": "With median follow-up of 113 months (range, 18-257 months), 4 of 36 patients (11%) developed a first recurrence of disease in the treated breast only. Two of the four recurrences in the breast were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only and two were invasive with DCIS. Two additional patients had a recurrence in the breast as a component of first failure. Actuarial local control rates for the breast as the only site of first recurrence were 91% at 5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 80-100%) and 87% (95% CI, 75-99%) at both 10 and 15 years. Actuarial local control rates for breast recurrence, as a component of first failure, were 91% (95% CI, 80-100%), 83% (95% CI, 69-97%), and 76% (95% CI, 58-94%) at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. No clinical factors were identified as significant predictors for breast recurrence. Five-, 10- and 15-year actuarial rates for survival without disease of 97% (95% CI, 90-100%) and 5-, 10-, and 15-year actuarial rates of overall survival of 93% (95% CI, 84-100%) at 5 years and 90% (95% CI, 78-100%) at 10 and 15 years were reported.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data confirm excellent rates of local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival at 10 and 15 years following BCS and RT for Paget disease of the breast.

There are very little prospective data on the treatment of pregnant women with breast cancer with chemotherapy and even less data on the outcomes of their children who were exposed to chemotherapy in utero.",
        "Methods": "Fifty-seven pregnant breast cancer patients were treated on a single-arm, multidisciplinary, institutional review board-approved protocol with FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in the adjuvant (n = 32) or neoadjuvant (n = 25) setting. Parents/guardians were surveyed by mail or telephone regarding outcomes of children exposed to chemotherapy in utero.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 57 women, 40 are alive and disease-free, 3 have recurrent breast cancer, 12 died from breast cancer, 1 died from other causes, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Of the 25 patients who received neoadjuvant FAC, 6 had a pathologic complete response, whereas 4 had no tumor response to chemotherapy and eventually died from their disease. All women who delivered had live births. One child has Down syndrome and 2 have congenital anomalies (club foot; congenital bilateral ureteral reflux). The children are healthy and those in school are doing well, although 2 have special educational needs.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer can be treated with FAC chemotherapy during the second and third trimesters without significant short-term complications for the majority of children exposed to chemotherapy in utero.

        "Background/Purpose": "As trials of 5 years of tamoxifen in early breast cancer mature, the relevance of hormone receptor measurements (and other patient characteristics) to long-term outcome can be assessed increasingly reliably. We report updated meta-analyses of the trials of 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "We undertook a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from 20 trials (n=21,457) in early breast cancer of about 5 years of tamoxifen versus no adjuvant tamoxifen, with about 80% compliance. Recurrence and death rate ratios (RRs) were from log-rank analyses by allocated treatment.",
        "Results/Findings": "In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease (n=10,645), allocation to about 5 years of tamoxifen substantially reduced recurrence rates throughout the first 10 years (RR 0·53 [SE 0·03] during years 0-4 and RR 0·68 [0·06] during years 5-9 [both 2p<0·00001]; but RR 0·97 [0·10] during years 10-14, suggesting no further gain or loss after year 10). Even in marginally ER-positive disease (10-19 fmol/mg cytosol protein) the recurrence reduction was substantial (RR 0·67 [0·08]). In ER-positive disease, the RR was approximately independent of progesterone receptor status (or level), age, nodal status, or use of chemotherapy. Breast cancer mortality was reduced by about a third throughout the first 15 years (RR 0·71 [0·05] during years 0-4, 0·66 [0·05] during years 5-9, and 0·68 [0·08] during years 10-14; p<0·0001 for extra mortality reduction during each separate time period). Overall non-breast-cancer mortality was little affected, despite small absolute increases in thromboembolic and uterine cancer mortality (both only in women older than 55 years), so all-cause mortality was substantially reduced. In ER-negative disease, tamoxifen had little or no effect on breast cancer recurrence or mortality.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen safely reduces 15-year risks of breast cancer recurrence and death. ER status was the only recorded factor importantly predictive of the proportional reductions.

        "Background/Purpose": "As the number of cancer survivors continues to increase, oncologists are faced with the challenge of providing cancer therapy to patients who may 1 day want to have children. Yet, gonadotoxic cancer treatments can compromise future fertility, either temporarily or permanently. There are established means of preserving fertility before cancer treatment; specifically, sperm cryopreservation for men and in vitro fertilization and embryo cryopreservation for women. Several innovative techniques are being actively investigated, including oocyte and ovarian follicle cryopreservation, ovarian tissue transplantation, and in vitro follicle maturation, which may expand the number of fertility preservation choices for young cancer patients. Fertility preservation may also require some modification of cancer therapy; thus, patients' wishes regarding future fertility and available fertility preservation alternatives should be discussed before initiation of therapy. This commentary provides an overview of the range of fertility preservation options currently available and under development, using case-based discussions to illustrate ways in which fertility preservation can be incorporated into oncology care. Cases involving breast cancer, testicular cancer, and rectal cancer are described to illustrate fertility issues experienced by male and female patients, as well as to provide examples of strategies for modifying surgical, medical, and radiation therapy to spare fertility. Current guidelines in oncology and reproductive medicine are also reviewed to underscore the importance of communicating fertility preservation options to young patients with cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "As the incidence of breast-conserving therapy in women of childbearing years increases, patient concerns regarding subsequent pregnancies and lactation have become more prevalent. There is a paucity of data regarding lactation outcomes in women who have undergone breast-conserving therapy and then sustained full-term pregnancies. Our objective was to evaluate lactation outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.",
        "Methods": "We reviewed a database of over 3,000 patients treated from 1965 to 2003 to identify our cohort of premenopausal women who underwent breast-conserving therapy and subsequently sustained full-term pregnancies. Lactation outcome parameters (breast swelling, ability to lactate, and volume of lactation in the treated and untreated breasts) were the main outcome measures.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 28 pregnancies in 21 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years. One patient underwent bilateral breast treatment; therefore, a total of 22 breasts were irradiated. All patients interviewed reported little or no swelling of the treated breast during pregnancy. Of the patients studied, 4 (18.2%) elected pharmacological suppression of lactation. Of the remaining 18 breasts, lactation occurred in 10 (55.6%), did not occur in 7 (38.9%) and was unknown for 1 (5.5%). The volume was reported as significantly diminished in 80% of breasts treated. Lactation in the contralateral breast occurred in all patients who did not undergo pharmacological suppression.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients can experience successful lactation in the contralateral, untreated breast after breast-conserving therapy. In the treated breast, functional lactation is possible but is significantly diminished in the majority of patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "As more women put off pregnancy until their 30s and beyond, the possibility of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) will rise. Treatment options for patients with PABC need to consider possible harm to the fetus. The goal of this study is to review our institution's experience with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies in patients with PABC. A prospectively accrued breast Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved data base was searched under separate IRB approval for cases of SLN biopsy in patients with PABC. Ten patients were identified between 1994 and 2006 out of 5,563 patients. A chart review was performed on all 10 patients. Ten patients with PABC and an average gestation age of 15.8 weeks underwent SLN biopsy. All patients successfully mapped. Positive SLN were identified in 5/10 patients (50%) while there was no evidence of metastases in 5/10 patients (50%). 9/10 (90%) of patients went on to deliver healthy children without any reported problems. One patient (10%) decided to terminate her pregnancy in the first trimester following surgery prior to the start of chemotherapy. SLN biopsy can safely be performed in patients with PABC with minimal risk to the fetus. By performing a SLN biopsy, a large proportion of patients with PABC may be spared the risk of a complete axillary lymph node dissection.",

        "Background/Purpose": "As a consequence of mammographic breast screening programmes, ductal carcinoma in situ is diagnosed with increasing frequency. Mastectomy for localised ductal carcinoma in situ is thought to be an over-treatment by many physicians, but there is much controversy as to whether complete local excision alone is sufficient. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant radiotherapy and tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "We used a 2x2 factorial design in a randomised controlled trial. Between May, 1990, and August, 1998, 1701 patients recruited from screening programmes were randomised to both treatments in combination or singly, or to none, or to either one (eg, radiotherapy) with an elective decision to give or to withhold the other (ie, in this case tamoxifen). Patients had complete surgical excision of the lesion confirmed by specimen radiography and histology. Patients have been followed up at least once a year. Median follow-up was 52.6 (range 2.4-118.3) months. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease.",
        "Results/Findings": "Ipsilateral invasive disease was not reduced by tamoxifen but recurrence of overall ductal carcinoma in situ was decreased (hazard ratio 0.68 [0.49-0.96]; p=0.03). Radiotherapy reduced the incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease (0.45 [0.24-0.85]; p=0.01) and ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ (0.36 [0.19-0.66]; p=0.0004), but there was no effect on the occurrence of contralateral disease. There was no evidence of interaction between radiotherapy and tamoxifen.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Radiotherapy can be recommended for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ treated by complete local excision; however, there is little evidence for the use of tamoxifen in these women.",

We therefore compared the long-term effects of exemestane monotherapy with sequential treatment (tamoxifen followed by exemestane).",
        "Methods": "The Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) phase 3 trial was conducted in hospitals in nine countries. Postmenopausal women (median age 64 years, range 35-96) with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to open-label exemestane (25 mg once a day, orally) alone or following tamoxifen (20 mg once a day, orally) for 5 years.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive goserelin 3·6 mg/month plus either anastrozole 1 mg per day and tamoxifen placebo or tamoxifen 20 mg per day and anastrozole placebo for 24 weeks before surgery. Patients were randomised sequentially, stratified by centre, with randomisation codes. All study personnel were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was best overall tumour response (complete response or partial response), assessed by callipers, during the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period for the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was analysed for non-inferiority (with non-inferiority defined as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in overall response rates between groups being 10% or less); in the event of non-inferiority, we assessed the superiority of the anastrozole group versus the tamoxifen group. We included all patients who received study medication at least once in the safety analysis set. We report the primary analysis; treatment will also continue in the adjuvant setting for 5 years. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 2, 2007, and May 29, 2009, 204 patients were enrolled. 197 patients were randomly assigned to anastrozole (n=98) or tamoxifen (n=99), and 185 patients completed the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period and had breast surgery (95 in the anastrazole group, 90 in the tamoxifen group). More patients in the anastrozole group had a complete or partial response than did those in the tamoxifen group during 24 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment (anastrozole 70·4% [69 of 98 patients] vs tamoxifen 50·5% [50 of 99 patients]; estimated difference between groups 19·9%, 95% CI 6·5-33·3; p=0·004). Two patients in the anastrozole group had treatment-related grade 3 adverse events (arthralgia and syncope) and so did one patient in the tamoxifen group (depression). One serious adverse event was reported in the anastrozole group (benign neoplasm, not related to treatment), compared with none in the tamoxifen group.",

Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the fulvestrant group than in the anastrozole group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·797, 95% CI 0·637-0·999, p=0·0486). Median progression-free survival was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·83-20·99) in the fulvestrant group versus 13·8 months (11·99-16·59) in the anastrozole group. The most common adverse events were arthralgia (38 [17%] in the fulvestrant group vs 24 [10%] in the anastrozole group) and hot flushes (26 [11%] in the fulvestrant group vs 24 [10%] in the anastrozole group). 16 (7%) of 228 patients in in the fulvestrant group and 11 (5%) of 232 patients in the anastrozole group discontinued because of adverse events.",

We found statistically significant survival benefits with third-generation aromatase inhibitors and inactivators (vorozole, letrozole, examestane, and anastrazole) (RH = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 0.93; P<.001) but not with first-generation (aminoglutethimide) or second-generation (formestane and fadrozole) agents. The difference in the summary effects between these two groups of trials was statistically significant (P = .04). The survival benefit with third-generation agents in first-line trials, in which these agents were compared with tamoxifen (11% RH reduction, 95% CI = 1% to 19%; P = .03), was identical to their benefit in second- and subsequent-line trials in which these agents were compared with other treatments (14% RH reduction, 95% CI = 6% to 21%; P<.001).",

        "Methods": "Eligible women had a baseline BMD T score of at least 2.0 in either the hip or L2-4 spine; all received calcium 500 mg and vitamin D 400 U daily. Percentage change in BMD (L2-L4 spine and hip) at 12 and 24 months, rate of osteoporosis, and change in markers of bone formation (serum bone alkaline phosphatase) and resorption (serum C-telopeptide and urine N-telopeptide) at 6, 12, and 24 months were compared.",
        "Results/Findings": "Two hundred twenty-six patients (122 letrozole, 104 placebo) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, including BMD, median age of 60.7 years (81% < 70 years), and median follow-up of 1.6 years. At 24 months, patients receiving letrozole had a significant decrease in total hip BMD (-3.6% v -0.71%; P = .044) and lumbar spine BMD (-5.35% v -0.70%; P = .008). Letrozole increased urine N-telopeptide at 6, 12, and 24 months (P = .054, < .001, and .016, respectively). No patient went below the threshold for osteoporosis in total hip BMD, whereas at the L2-L4 (posteroanterior view), more women became osteoporotic by BMD while receiving letrozole (4.1% v 0%; P = .064).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, subsequent letrozole causes a modest increase in bone resorption and reduction in bone mineral density in the spine and hip compared to placebo.

The main efficacy end point was pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0/is ypN0). Results are descriptive.",
        "Results/Findings": "Safety populations were 199 and 198 patients in cohorts A and B, respectively. Three patients [1.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31% to 4.34%] in cohort A experienced four New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure events. Thirteen patients (6.5%; 95% CI 3.5% to 10.9%) in cohort A and four (2.0%; 95% CI 0.6% to 5.1%) in cohort B experienced at least one left ventricular ejection fraction decline. No new safety signals were identified. pCR rates were 61.8% and 60.7% in cohorts A and B, respectively. The highest pCR rates were in the HER2-enriched PAM50 subtype (75.0% and 73.7%, respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and common anthracycline-containing regimens for the neoadjuvant treatment of early breast cancer resulted in cardiac and general safety profiles, and pCR rates, consistent with prior studies with pertuzumab.",

        "Methods": "We collected information concerning patients treated with anthracyclines during pregnancy from a review of literature between 1976 and 2001 and our experience. The events analyzed were malformations, fetal death and spontaneous abortion. A chi(2) test with a Yates correction was used to compare the distribution of severe events.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 160 patient pregnancies were analyzed. The fetal outcome was frequently normal (73%). Abnormalities included malformations (3%), fetal death (9%), spontaneous abortion (3%), fetal complications (8%) and prematurity (6%). Fetal death was often directly consecutive to maternal death (40%). Unfavorable fetal outcome was significantly more frequent in leukemia patients (P = 0.001). In patients with solid tumors, the first trimester was significantly associated with more complications (P = 0.029).

For a subset of patients who categorically refuse alopecia, or for those with a contraindication to those drugs, there is an urgent need to define alternative regimens. Here, we report our institutional experience with trastuzumab and vinorelbine (tv), a combination with good clinical activity and a good side effect profile for patients with her2-positive breast cancer.",
        "Methods": "In a retrospective analysis, outcomes data were extracted for patients receiving tv as their only chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting at the Jewish General Hospital. For the most part, tv was administered weekly for 6 months, followed by trastuzumab for 6 months.",
        "Results/Findings": "The analysis identified 46 patients (mean age: 64 years) who received tv between 2003 and 2012 (n = 36 adjuvant, n = 10 neoadjuvant). Of the patients in the adjuvant group, 81% had stage i disease. In the neoadjuvant group, 3 patients experienced a complete pathologic response. Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence after a short course (3 months) of adjuvant tv. Overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival were 94% and 98% respectively at a median 5 years of follow-up. Febrile neutropenia-induced sepsis resulted in the death of 1 patient with significant medical comorbidities; 2 other patients died of comorbidities unrelated to their cancer or treatment. Grades 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (23%), febrile neutropenia (10%), fatigue (2%), and anemia (2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For patients with non-metastatic breast cancer refusing alopecia, or for patients who are not candidates for standard chemotherapy, tv is a reasonable alternative to standard adjuvant chemotherapy.",

Combined analysis of two international randomised, double-blind trials (n=1021) showed that in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours, first-line treatment with anastrozole significantly prolonged the time to progression (TTP) compared with tamoxifen (median TTP: 10.7 versus 6.4 months, respectively; P=0.022). Second-line tamoxifen following anastrozole, or vice versa, in this trial population was unblinded. The treatments were crossed over and then efficacy was assessed using a questionnaire. Of 511 patients randomised to anastrozole, 137 (26.8%) received second-line tamoxifen. Questionnaire data were available for 119 patients; 58 (48.7%) gained clinical benefit (CB=complete+partial response (CR+PR)+(stable disease (SD) >/=24 weeks)), while 12 (10.1%) had an objective response (OR=CR+PR). Of 510 patients randomised to tamoxifen, 134 (26.3%) received second-line anastrozole. Questionnaire data from 95 patients showed that 54 (56.8%) gained CB and 7 of the patients gaining CB (7.4%) had an OR. Previous studies showed anastrozole is effective after first-line tamoxifen. These data show that the sequential administration of first-line anastrozole followed by tamoxifen provides effective use of these drugs in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "Utilizing a population-based nested case-control study design, we enrolled 365 patients diagnosed with an estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) first primary invasive breast cancer and a second primary contralateral invasive breast cancer, and 726 matched controls diagnosed with only an ER+ first primary invasive breast cancer. Obesity, alcohol use, and smoking data were ascertained from medical record reviews and participant interviews. Using conditional logistic regression we evaluated associations between these three exposures and second primary contralateral breast cancer risk.",
        "Results/Findings": "Obesity, consumption of >or= 7 alcoholic beverages per week, and current smoking were all positively related to risk of contralateral breast cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.1; OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.2; and OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.0, respectively). Compared with women who consumed fewer than seven alcoholic beverages per week and were never or former smokers, women who consumed >or= 7 drinks per week and were current smokers had a 7.2-fold (95% CI, 1.9 to 26.5) elevated risk of contralateral breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "An increasing proportion of patients (> 30%) with node-positive breast cancer will obtain an axillary pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). If sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) is accurate in this setting, completion node dissection (CND) morbidity could be avoided.",
        "Methods": "In the prospective multicentric SN FNAC study, patients with biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer (T0-3, N1-2) underwent both SNB and CND. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) use was mandatory, and SN metastases of any size, including isolated tumor cells (ypN0[i+], ≤ 0.2 mm), were considered positive. The optimal SNB identification rate (IR) ≥ 90% and false-negative rate (FNR) ≤ 10% were predetermined.",
        "Results/Findings": "From March 2009 to December 2012, 153 patients were accrued to the study. The SNB IR was 87.6% (127 of 145; 95% CI, 82.2% to 93.0%), and the FNR was 8.4% (seven of 83; 95% CI, 2.4% to 14.4%). If SN ypN0(i+)s had been considered negative, the FNR would have increased to 13.3% (11 of 83; 95% CI, 6.0% to 20.6%). There was no correlation between size of SN metastases and rate of positive non-SNs. Using this method, 30.3% of patients could potentially avoid CND.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer after NAC, a low SNB FNR (8.4%) can be achieved with mandatory use of IHC. SN metastases of any size should be considered positive. The SNB IR was 87.6%, and in the presence of a technical failure, axillary node dissection should be performed. We recommend that SN evaluation with IHC be further evaluated before being included in future guidelines on the use of SNB after NAC in this setting.",

        "Background/Purpose": "An earlier analysis of this phase 3 trial showed that the addition of a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor to endocrine therapy provided a greater benefit with regard to progression-free survival than endocrine therapy alone in premenopausal or perimenopausal patients with advanced hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Here we report the results of a protocol-specified interim analysis of the key secondary end point of overall survival.",
        "Methods": "We randomly assigned patients to receive either ribociclib or placebo in addition to endocrine therapy (goserelin and either a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen). Overall survival was evaluated with the use of a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 672 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. There were 83 deaths among 335 patients (24.8%) in the ribociclib group and 109 deaths among 337 patients (32.3%) in the placebo group. The addition of ribociclib to endocrine therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than endocrine therapy alone. The estimated overall survival at 42 months was 70.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.5 to 76.0) in the ribociclib group and 46.0% (95% CI, 32.0 to 58.9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; P = 0.00973 by log-rank test). The survival benefit seen in the subgroup of 495 patients who received an aromatase inhibitor was consistent with that in the overall intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.98). The percentage of patients who received subsequent antineoplastic therapy was balanced between the groups (68.9% in the ribociclib group and 73.2% in the placebo group). The time from randomization to disease progression during receipt of second-line therapy or to death was also longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This trial showed significantly longer overall survival with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy than with endocrine therapy alone among patients with advanced hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

Tamoxifen assignment was not randomized-physician discretion was used for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Trial protocol then specified assignment to postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors, although not all took tamoxifen.",
        "Methods": "CALGB 8541 assessed HER-2/neu expression in patients with ER-positive disease by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and amplification by differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IHC assessed expression of p53. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models assessed tamoxifen-HER-2/neu status interactions and tamoxifen-p53 status interactions.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER-2/neu status was available for 651 patients with ER-positive disease; 650, 608, and 353 patients were assessed by IHC, PCR, and FISH, respectively. Approximately one half received tamoxifen. Reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death resulting from tamoxifen was approximately 37% (32% with overexpression and 39% with normal expression of HER-2/neu; n = 155 by IHC). The tamoxifen-HER-2/neu status interaction was not significant in multivariate analysis of all three HER-2/neu assessment methods. Tamoxifen-p53 interaction did not significantly predict outcome.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Disease-free and overall survival benefit of tamoxifen in patients with ER-positive, node-positive breast cancer does not depend on HER-2/neu or p53 status.

        "Background/Purpose": "Amplification of the HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) gene resulting in overexpression of the p185HER-2 growth factor receptor occurs in approximately 25% of early stage breast cancers. HER-2/neu has been established as an important independent prognostic factor in early stage breast cancer in large cohorts of patients and in cohorts with very long (30 year) follow-up duration. New data are emerging to suggest that HER-2/neu may be useful not only as a prognostic factor but also as a predictive marker for projecting response to chemotherapeutics, antiestrogens, and therapeutic anti-HER-2/neu monoclonal antibodies. In this review we highlight recent data on HER-2/neu as a predictive marker of response to breast cancer therapy and discuss the clinical implications of this information. The difficulty in comparing results from different data sets due to the wide variety of reagents and technologies used to detect HER-2/neu amplification/overexpression in clinical specimens is also discussed. Finally, we report results from experimental models of HER-2/neu overexpression which have been used in an effort to understand the relationship between HER-2/neu and response to chemotherapeutics and antiestrogens in breast cancer.",

Nonetheless, it remains to be established whether BCT also is the optimal treatment option for early breast carcinoma in young women, because these women generally have more aggressive disease and a higher frequency of local recurrence compared with older women.",
        "Methods": "We investigated a cohort of 9285 premenopausal women with primary breast carcinoma who were age < 50 years at diagnosis. These women were identified from a population-based Danish breast carcinoma database containing detailed information on patient and tumor characteristics, predetermined treatment regimens, and survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "In total, 7165 patients (77.2%) were treated with RM, and 2120 patients (22.8%) were treated with BCT. We calculated the relative risk of death within the first 10 years after diagnosis according to surgical treatment and age, both before and after adjustment for known prognostic factors. No increased risk of death was observed among women who received BCT compared with women who underwent RM, regardless of age at diagnosis (< 35 years, 35-39 years, 40-44 years, or 45-49 years), despite the increased risk of local recurrence among young women. Restricting the analysis to women with small tumors (size < 2 cm) yielded similar results.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Although well studied in families at high-risk, the roles of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are poorly understood in breast cancers in the general population, particularly in Black women and in age groups outside of the very young. We examined the prevalence and predictors of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in 1,628 women with breast cancer and 674 women without breast cancer who participated in a multicenter population-based case-control study of Black and White women, 35 to 64 years of age. Among cases, 2.4% and 2.3% carried deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. BRCA1 mutations were significantly more common in White (2.9%) versus Black (1.4%) cases and in Jewish (10.2%) versus non-Jewish (2.0%) cases; BRCA2 mutations were slightly more frequent in Black (2.6%) versus White (2.1%) cases. Numerous familial and demographic factors were significantly associated with BRCA1 and, to a lesser extent, BRCA2 carrier status, when examined individually. In models considering all predictors together, early onset ages in cases and in relatives, family history of ovarian cancer, and Jewish ancestry remained strongly and significantly predictive of BRCA1 carrier status, whereas BRCA2 predictors were fewer and more modest in magnitude. Both the combinations of predictors and effect sizes varied across racial/ethnic and age groups. These results provide first-time prevalence estimates for BRCA1/BRCA2 in breast cancer cases among understudied racial and age groups and show key predictors of mutation carrier status for both White and Black women and women of a wide age spectrum with breast cancer in the general population.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Although numerous studies have shown that the status of the sentinel node is an accurate predictor of the status of the axillary nodes in breast cancer, the efficacy and safety of sentinel-node biopsy require validation.",
        "Methods": "From March 1998 to December 1999, we randomly assigned 516 patients with primary breast cancer in whom the tumor was less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter either to sentinel-node biopsy and total axillary dissection (the axillary-dissection group) or to sentinel-node biopsy followed by axillary dissection only if the sentinel node contained metastases (the sentinel-node group).",
        "Results/Findings": "The number of sentinel nodes found was the same in the two groups. A sentinel node was positive in 83 of the 257 patients in the axillary-dissection group (32.3 percent), and in 92 of the 259 patients in the sentinel-node group (35.5 percent). In the axillary-dissection group, the overall accuracy of the sentinel-node status was 96.9 percent, the sensitivity 91.2 percent, and the specificity 100 percent. There was less pain and better arm mobility in the patients who underwent sentinel-node biopsy only than in those who also underwent axillary dissection. There were 15 events associated with breast cancer in the axillary-dissection group and 10 such events in the sentinel-node group. Among the 167 patients who did not undergo axillary dissection, there were no cases of overt axillary metastasis during follow-up.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Although mastectomy is considered the gold standard for male breast cancer (MBC), the utilization of lumpectomy and its impact on outcomes in MBC patients has not been previously studied.",
        "Methods": "The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify all MBC patients who underwent either mastectomy or less than mastectomy (i.e., lumpectomy) between 1983 and 2009.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 4707 (86.8 %) men underwent mastectomy and 718 (13.2 %) underwent lumpectomy. A greater proportion of patients underwent lumpectomy later in the study period (1983 to 1986, 10.6 %, vs. 2007 to 2009, 15.1 %). A greater percentage of lumpectomy patients were 80 years or older (21.3 % vs. 16.3 %), had stage IV disease (7.3 % vs. 3.1 %), and received no lymph node sampling (34.3 % vs. 6.9 %). Only 35.4 % of patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy. Ten-year breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival were 82.8 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in lumpectomy patients vs. 77.3 % and 46.4 %, respectively, in mastectomy patients. On Cox proportional hazards regression, lumpectomy was not independently associated with worse breast cancer-specific survival (odds ratio 1.09, 95 % confidence interval 0.87-1.37) or overall survival (odds ratio 1.12, 95 % confidence interval 0.98-1.27) after controlling for age, race, stage, and grade, as well as whether radiotherapy was received.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Lumpectomy is performed in a small but growing proportion of MBC patients. These patients are not only older and more likely to have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, but they also are less likely to receive standard of care therapy, such as lymph node sampling and adjuvant radiotherapy. Despite these observations, breast cancer-specific survival is unaffected by the type of surgery.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Although carcinoma presenting as axillary metastases is assumed to be due to breast cancer, identification of the primary lesion may prove problematic. We investigated the ability of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the primary tumor, thereby confirming the diagnosis and broadening treatment options.",
        "Methods": "From 1995 to 2001, 69 patients at our institution presented with occult primary breast cancer. All patients had negative breast examinations and mammograms and underwent breast MRI.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 69 patients, 55 had axillary adenopathy without evidence of distant disease (stage II); 14 had stage IV disease. In patients with stage II disease, MRI revealed suspicious lesions in 76% (42 of 55). In 62% (26 of 42), the MRI finding proved to be the occult primary tumor. Of these, 58% (15 of 26) were candidates for breast conservation. MRI did not identify the primary tumor in 25 women; 12 underwent mastectomy. Cancer was found in 33% (4 of 12) of these. Thirteen patients were treated with primary breast irradiation; three were lost to follow-up, one developed distant disease, and nine were without evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. In women with stage IV disease, MRI identified the primary tumor in 5 of 9 patients with regional adenopathy and 2 of 5 patients with distant disease (overall 50%; 7 of 14). MRI identified the primary tumor in women with both mammographically dense (19 of 44; 43%) and less dense (10 of 20; 50%) breasts.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Although attempts have been made to identify the risk factors leading to complications after combined skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction, hardly any criteria are available to preoperatively distinguish patients in whom such an eventful postoperative course may be expected. Therefore, the authors wanted to establish which factors increase the risk of surgical complications to such a level as to adjust their indications for immediate breast reconstruction after skin-sparing mastectomy.",
        "Methods": "The authors prospectively studied the clinical relevance of six patient-related and nine procedure-related characteristics as potential risk factors for a complicated surgical outcome in 400 combined procedures in 309 patients by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Risk factors that proved significantly correlated with loss of implant by both analyses were accepted as clinical selection criteria that distinguish potential candidates with an unacceptably high risk of such loss.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mild complications occurred significantly more often in patients who were older than the mean age of 43 years and in breasts that were more than average sized or operated on by a fellow in oncologic surgery. Implants were lost significantly more often in patients who were obese or smoked and in breasts that were more than average sized.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The clinically relevant increase of risk of implant loss should lead to reluctance to perform combined skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction in obese patients who smoke (32 percent loss) and in those with more than average sized breasts (27 percent loss).",

The dual primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival assessed both in the overall population and among patients with AKT pathway-altered ( ,  , or  ) tumors. Safety was assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, 708 patients underwent randomization; 289 patients (40.8%) had AKT pathway alterations, and 489 (69.1%) had received a CDK4/6 inhibitor previously for advanced breast cancer. In the overall population, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 3.6 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.71; P<0.001).

We describe the absolute magnitude of these reductions according to various prognostic and other patient characteristics, and relate the absolute reduction in 15-year risk of breast cancer death to the absolute reduction in 10-year recurrence risk.",
        "Methods": "We undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data for 10,801 women in 17 randomised trials of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, 8337 of whom had pathologically confirmed node-negative (pN0) or node-positive (pN+) disease.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, radiotherapy reduced the 10-year risk of any (ie, locoregional or distant) first recurrence from 35·0% to 19·3% (absolute reduction 15·7%, 95% CI 13·7-17·7, 2p<0·00001) and reduced the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 25·2% to 21·4% (absolute reduction 3·8%, 1·6-6·0, 2p=0·00005). In women with pN0 disease (n=7287), radiotherapy reduced these risks from 31·0% to 15·6% (absolute recurrence reduction 15·4%, 13·2-17·6, 2p<0·00001) and from 20·5% to 17·2% (absolute mortality reduction 3·3%, 0·8-5·8, 2p=0·005), respectively. In these women with pN0 disease, the absolute recurrence reduction varied according to age, grade, oestrogen-receptor status, tamoxifen use, and extent of surgery, and these characteristics were used to predict large (≥20%), intermediate (10-19%), or lower (<10%) absolute reductions in the 10-year recurrence risk. Absolute reductions in 15-year risk of breast cancer death in these three prediction categories were 7·8% (95% CI 3·1-12·5), 1·1% (-2·0 to 4·2), and 0·1% (-7·5 to 7·7) respectively (trend in absolute mortality reduction 2p=0·03). In the few women with pN+ disease (n=1050), radiotherapy reduced the 10-year recurrence risk from 63·7% to 42·5% (absolute reduction 21·2%, 95% CI 14·5-27·9, 2p<0·00001) and the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 51·3% to 42·8% (absolute reduction 8·5%, 1·8-15·2, 2p=0·01). Overall, about one breast cancer death was avoided by year 15 for every four recurrences avoided by year 10, and the mortality reduction did not differ significantly from this overall relationship in any of the three prediction categories for pN0 disease or for pN+ disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy to the conserved breast halves the rate at which the disease recurs and reduces the breast cancer death rate by about a sixth. These proportional benefits vary little between different groups of women. By contrast, the absolute benefits from radiotherapy vary substantially according to the characteristics of the patient and they can be predicted at the time when treatment decisions need to be made.",

We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, aged 18 years or older, and with a clear indication for chemotherapy, by a computerised minimisation process (1:1), to receive either 6-month or 12-month trastuzumab delivered every 3 weeks intravenously (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (600 mg), given in combination with chemotherapy (concurrently or sequentially). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat, with a non-inferiority margin of 3% for 4-year disease-free survival. Safety was analysed in all patients who received trastuzumab. This trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2006-007018-39), ISRCTN (number 52968807), and ClinicalTrials.gov (number  ).",

Median follow-up was 5·4 years (IQR 3·6-6·7) for both treatment groups, during which a disease-free survival event occurred in 265 (13%) of 2043 patients in the 6-month group and 247 (12%) of 2045 patients in the 12-month group. 4-year disease-free survival was 89·4% (95% CI 87·9-90·7) in the 6-month group and 89·8% (88·3-91·1) in the 12-month group (hazard ratio 1·07 [90% CI 0·93-1·24], non-inferiority p=0·011), showing non-inferiority of the 6-month treatment. 6-month trastuzumab treatment resulted in fewer patients reporting severe adverse events (373 [19%] of 1939 patients vs 459 [24%] of 1894 patients, p=0·0002) or stopping early because of cardiotoxicity (61 [3%] of 1939 patients vs 146 [8%] of 1894 patients, p<0·0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We have shown that 6-month trastuzumab treatment is non-inferior to 12-month treatment in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, with less cardiotoxicity and fewer severe adverse events.

The rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was 92.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, as compared with 88.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.80; P<0.001). With 194 deaths (4.1% of the patients), overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (hazard ratio for death in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.51; P=0.37). Selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported for 30.6% of the patients in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 29.4% of those in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group, with profiles similar to those for postmenopausal women.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer, adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression, as compared with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, significantly reduced recurrence.

        "Methods": "Patients aged ≥18 years with stage I-III TNBC were randomized (1:1) to receive either paclitaxel (P) weekly × 12 plus carboplatin AUC6 every 21 days × 4 followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) every 14 days × 4 (CbP → AC, arm A), or carboplatin AUC6 + docetaxel (D) every 21 days × 6 (CbD, arm B). Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL) were assessed. Primary endpoint was pCR in breast and axilla. Other endpoints included residual cancer burden (RCB), toxicity, cost, and event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS).",
        "Results/Findings": "One hundred patients were randomized; arm A (  = 48) or arm B (  = 52). pCR was 54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40%-69%] in arm A and 54% (95% CI, 40%-68%) in arm B.

        "Background/Purpose": "Acellular dermal matrix has become a common adjunct in prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. The authors' aim was to determine whether acellular dermal matrix use in immediate prosthesis-based breast reconstruction is associated with higher rate of complications.",
        "Methods": "Over a 5½-year period at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, 470 postmastectomy defects were reconstructed immediately using tissue expanders or implants. These were divided into two groups: reconstructions with or without acellular dermal matrix. Data were collected on patient comorbidities, radiation, intraoperative tumescent solution use, prosthesis size, initial fill volume, and complications.",
        "Results/Findings": "The risk for major infections that required prosthesis removal was elevated in the acellular dermal matrix group (4.9 versus 2.5 percent), but this increase did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.172). There was a statistically significant increase in overall wound infection rate in the acellular dermal matrix group (6.8 versus 2.5 percent, p = 0.031), but in a multivariate analysis, the use of acellular dermal matrix did not materialize as a significant risk factor for overall wound infection. Overall surgical complication rate was significantly higher in the acellular dermal matrix group at 19.5 percent, compared with the non-acellular dermal matrix group at 12.3 percent (p < 0.001). Other significant risk factors for overall surgical complication included smoking, higher body mass index, higher initial volume, and larger implant size.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patient selection for prosthesis reconstruction involving acellular dermal matrix should be judicious, especially among smokers and patients with elevated body mass index. Even though the use of acellular dermal matrix allows higher initial volumes and reduced number of expansions, one should be careful about putting in too high of an initial volume.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Accurate assessment of HER-2 status is necessary prior to anti-HER-2 antibody (trastuzumab) therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. However, controversy exists regarding whether to assess HER-2 status in the primary tumor or in metastatic lesions. It is also unclear whether HER-2 status can change during disease progression or after chemotherapy.",
        "Methods": "Breast carcinoma samples from 60 women with known HER-2 status in both primary tumors and paired metastases (locoregional disease, n = 43 patients; distant disease, n = 17 patients) were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-two patients underwent chemotherapy before their metastatic lesions were sampled, including 18 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 14 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. The HER-2 gene was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization either in paraffin-embedded tissue samples (48 primary tumors and 9 metastatic tumors) or in fine-needle aspirates (12 primary tumors and 51 metastatic tumors). HER-2 gene amplification was defined as a HER-2:chromosome 17 signal ratio >/= 2.0.",
        "Results/Findings": "The HER-2 status of primary and metastatic tumors agreed in 58 of 60 patients (97%), including 18 (30%) amplified tumors and 40 (67%) nonamplified tumors. A discrepancy in HER-2 status was observed in specimens from two patients in which HER-2 amplification was detected in the primary tumor but not the metastatic tumors. In one patient, three foci of tumor nodules were found in the same breast; the HER-2 status was assessed in only one of them, which showed amplification; however, HER-2 amplification was not detected in the axillary lymph node metastasis. In another patient, the HER-2 gene was amplified in the primary tumor but not in the liver metastasis. No metastases showed HER-2 amplification without amplification in the primary tumor. Locoregional and distant metastases demonstrated similar concordance rates with their corresponding primary tumors (98% and 94%, respectively). Complete concordance of HER-2 status was found between primary tumors prior to chemotherapy and metastases that were sampled after chemotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The HER-2 status in breast carcinoma generally was stable during metastasis, whether to locoregional or distant sites. Chemotherapy did not modify the HER-2 status in metastatic lesions. Therefore, HER-2 amplification can be evaluated reliably in material from either primary or metastatic tumors in most patients. Further study with larger series is warranted to elucidate the significance of discordant results.",

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has the theoretical advantage of a further increase in dose conformity compared with three-dimensional techniques, with more normal tissue sparing. The aim of this randomised trial is to compare the local recurrence and survival of APBI using the IMRT technique after breast-conserving surgery to conventional whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in early stage BC.",
        "Methods": "This study was performed at the University of Florence (Florence, Italy). Women aged more than 40years affected by early BC, with a maximum pathological tumour size of 25mm, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either WBI or APBI using IMRT. Patients in the APBI arm received a total dose of 30 Gy to the tumour bed in five daily fractions. The WBI arm received 50Gy in 25 fractions, followed by a boost on the tumour bed of 10Gy in five fractions. The primary end-point was occurrence of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrences (IBTRs); the main analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 520 patients were randomised (260 to external WBI and 260 to APBI with IMRT) between March 2005 and June 2013. At a median follow-up of 5.0 years (Interquartile Range (IQR) 3.4-7.0), the IBTR rate was 1.5% (three cases) in the APBI group (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-3.0) and in the WBI group (three cases; 95% CI 0.0-2.8). No significant difference emerged between the two groups (log rank test p=0.86). We identified seven deaths in the WBI group and only one in the APBI group (p=0.057). The 5-year overall survival was 96.6% for the WBI group and 99.4% for the APBI group. The APBI group presented significantly better results considering acute (p=0.0001), late (p=0.004), and cosmetic outcome (p=0.045).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "To our knowledge, this is the first randomised study using the IMRT technique for APBI delivery. No significant difference in terms of IBTR and overall survival was observed between the two arms. APBI displayed a significantly better toxicity profile.",

        "Methods": "Sixty-three women with histologically confirmed and measurable MBC received 300 mg/m2 ABI-007 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks without premedication. Forty-eight patients received prior chemotherapy; 39 patients received no prior treatment for metastatic disease.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall response rates (complete or partial responses) were 48% (95% CI, 35.3% to 60.0%) for all patients.

Median time to disease progression was 26.6 weeks, and median survival was 63.6 weeks. No severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported despite the lack of premedication. Toxicities observed were typical of paclitaxel and included grade 4 neutropenia (24%), grade 3 sensory neuropathy (11%), and grade 4 febrile neutropenia (5%).

        "Background/Purpose": "A total of 668 patients (340 anastrozole and 328 tamoxifen) were randomised in a double-blind, double-dummy multicentre study. Anastrozole was given in a dose of 1 mg once daily and compared with tamoxifen 20 mg daily in postmenopausal patients with tumours that were hormone-receptor positive or of unknown receptor status. The efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole was compared with that of tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer. The median time to progression was similar for both treatments (8.2 months in anastrozole patients and 8.3 months in tamoxifen patients). Anastrozole was also as effective as tamoxifen in terms of objective response-rate with 33% in the anastrozole group and 32.6% in the tamoxifen group achieving a complete or partial response. Both treatments were well tolerated. However, incidences of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen. In conclusion, these findings indicate that anastrozole can be considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "A retrospective analysis to assess the prognostic and predictive clinical value of breast tumor ErbB-2 receptor expression quantified by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), to compare levels measured by EIA with ErbB-2 status determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and to correlate receptor content with levels of phosphorylated (Y1248-P) ErbB-2, a measure of functional tyrosine kinase activity.",
        "Methods": "EIA quantification of ErbB-2 was performed on membrane extracts from 3,208 well-characterized primary breast cancers. Overall, relapse-free, distant disease-free, and local/regional-free patient survival data were available on 1,123 of these tumors. IHC scoring for ErbB-2 status (HercepTest; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was performed on adjacent sections of 151 cases, and receptor functionality was measured in 230 tumors by an antibody specific for phosphorylated (Y1248-P) ErbB-2.",
        "Results/Findings": "Unlike nonmalignant breast tissues, breast tumors showed increased ErbB-2 levels in a bimodal distribution, with 12% constituting a distinct set of ErbB-2-overexpressing tumors. The intermodal threshold value for ErbB-2 overexpression distinguished tumors with reduced estrogen and progesterone receptor content, high IHC score for ErbB-2, and significantly increased levels of phosphorylated (Y1248-P) ErbB-2 receptor. By multivariate analysis, EIA-determined ErbB-2 overexpression predicted significantly reduced patient survival that was unaffected by tamoxifen or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil adjuvant therapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Determination of ErbB-2 receptor expression by EIA offers a clinically valuable alternative to semiquantitative IHC assessment of breast tumor ErbB-2 overexpression and affords the opportunity to evaluate ErbB-2 phosphorylation, which may represent an important predictive parameter of receptor functionality.",

        "Methods": "Three hundred thirty-seven postmenopausal women with ER and/or PgR positive primary untreated breast cancer were randomly assigned once daily treatment with either letrozole 2.5 mg or tamoxifen 20 mg for four months. At baseline none of the patients were considered to be candidates for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and 14% of the patients were considered inoperable.

Secondary endpoints included overall objective response on ultrasound and mammography and the number of patients who qualified for BCS.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall objective response rate (clinical palpation) was statistically significantly superior in the letrozole group, 55% compared to tamoxifen, 36% (P < 0.001). Secondary endpoints of ultrasound response, 35% vs. 25% (P = 0.042), mammographic response, 34% vs. 16% (P < 0.001), and BCS, 45% vs. 35% (P = 0.022) between the letrozole and tamoxifen groups, respectively, showed letrozole to be significantly superior.

        "Methods": "The trial included 179 patients with breast cancer of up to 20 mm in diameter at macroscopic examination. Eighty-eight patients had conservative management and 91 a mastectomy. All patients had axillary dissection with frozen-section examination. For patients with positive axillary nodes (N+), a second randomization was performed: lymph node irradiation versus no further regional treatment. Patterns of failure were determined by a competing-risk approach and multivariate analysis. A prognostic-score was determined by multivariate analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall survival, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, new primary malignancy, and locoregional recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two surgical groups, or between lymph node irradiation groups. Most recurrences appeared during the first 10 years. Three distinct prognostic groups were determined taking into account age, tumor size, histologic grading, and number of positive axillary nodes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Long-term results support conservative treatment with limited surgery and systematic breast irradiation as a safe procedure for the management of small breast cancers. Four easily obtainable clinical and histologic factors may be combined in a prognostic score that is highly predictive of overall and event-free survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "A planned interim analysis of study EGF100151 prompted early termination of enrollment based on a longer time to progression with lapatinib and capecitabine than with capecitabine alone in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2(+) previously treated advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Here, we report final analyses of overall survival.",
        "Methods": "Women with HER-2(+) MBC who progressed after regimens that included, but were not limited to, anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab, were randomized to lapatinib (1,250 mg/day) plus capecitabine (2,000 mg/m(2)) or capecitabine monotherapy (2,500 mg/m(2)) on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle.",
        "Results/Findings": "At enrollment termination, 399 patients were randomized, and nine were being screened and were offered combination treatment. In total, 207 and 201 patients were enrolled to combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively. Thirty-six patients receiving monotherapy crossed over to combination therapy following enrollment termination. The median overall survival times were 75.0 weeks for the combination arm and 64.7 weeks for the monotherapy arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.08; p = .210). A Cox regression analysis considering crossover as a time-dependent covariate suggested a 20% lower risk for death for patients treated with combination therapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99; p = .043). The low incidence of serious adverse events was consistent with previously reported rates.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although premature enrollment termination and subsequent crossover resulted in insufficient power to detect differences in overall survival, exploratory analyses demonstrate a trend toward a survival advantage with lapatinib plus capecitabine. These data continue to support the efficacy of lapatinib in patients with HER-2(+) MBC.",

We performed a phase 3 study that was designed to confirm and expand the efficacy and safety data for palbociclib plus letrozole for this indication.",
        "Methods": "In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 666 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, who had not had prior treatment for advanced disease, to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigators; secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, clinical benefit response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetic effects, and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median progression-free survival was 24.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to not estimable) in the palbociclib-letrozole group, as compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9 to 17.1) in the placebo-letrozole group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (occurring in 66.4% of the patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group vs. 1.4% in the placebo-letrozole group), leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in none of the patients in the placebo-letrozole group. Permanent discontinuation of any study treatment as a result of adverse events occurred in 43 patients (9.7%) in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in 13 patients (5.9%) in the placebo-letrozole group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with previously untreated ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, palbociclib combined with letrozole resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than that with letrozole alone, although the rates of myelotoxic effects were higher with palbociclib-letrozole.

        "Background/Purpose": "5-year results of the UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) trials suggested that lower total doses of radiotherapy delivered in fewer, larger doses (fractions) are at least as safe and effective as the historical standard regimen (50 Gy in 25 fractions) for women after primary surgery for early breast cancer. In this prespecified analysis, we report the 10-year follow-up of the START trials testing 13 fraction and 15 fraction regimens.",
        "Methods": "From 1999 to 2002, women with completely excised invasive breast cancer (pT1-3a, pN0-1, M0) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment (where prescribed). Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre, type of primary surgery (breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy), and tumour bed boost radiotherapy. In START-A, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 41·6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. In START-B, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction. Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects. Analysis was by intention to treat. Follow-up data are still being collected. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779.",
        "Results/Findings": "START-A enrolled 2236 women. Median follow-up was 9·3 years (IQR 8·0-10·0), after which 139 local-regional relapses had occurred. 10-year rates of local-regional relapse did not differ significantly between the 41·6 Gy and 50 Gy regimen groups (6·3%, 95% CI 4·7-8·5 vs 7·4%, 5·5-10·0; hazard ratio [HR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·59-1·38; p=0·65) or the 39 Gy (8·8%, 95% CI 6·7-11·4) and 50 Gy regimen groups (HR 1·18, 95% CI 0·79-1·76; p=0·41). In START-A, moderate or marked breast induration, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Normal tissue effects did not differ significantly between 41·6 Gy and 50 Gy groups. START-B enrolled 2215 women. Median follow-up was 9·9 years (IQR 7·5-10·1), after which 95 local-regional relapses had occurred. The proportion of patients with local-regional relapse at 10 years did not differ significantly between the 40 Gy group (4·3%, 95% CI 3·2-5·9) and the 50 Gy group (5·5%, 95% CI 4·2-7·2; HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·51-1·16; p=0·21). In START-B, breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 40 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Long-term follow-up confirms that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy is safe and effective for patients with early breast cancer. The results support the continued use of 40 Gy in 15 fractions, which has already been adopted by most UK centres as the standard of care for women requiring adjuvant radiotherapy for invasive early breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "EORTC 22922/10925, a randomised, phase 3 trial done across 46 radiation oncology departments from 13 countries, included women up to 75 years of age with unilateral, histologically confirmed, stage I-III breast adenocarcinoma with involved axillary nodes or a central or medially located primary tumour. Surgery consisted of mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and axillary staging. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using minimisation to receive IM-MS irradiation at 50 Gy in 25 fractions (IM-MS irradiation group) or no IM-MS irradiation (control group). Stratification was done for institution, menopausal status, site of the primary tumour within the breast, type of breast and axillary surgery, and pathological T and N stage. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, breast cancer mortality, any breast cancer recurrence, and cause of death.

        "Results/Findings": "Between Aug 5, 1996, and Jan 13, 2004, we enrolled 4004 patients, of whom 2002 were randomly assigned to the IM-MS irradiation group and 2002 to the no IM-MS irradiation group. At a median follow-up of 15·7 years (IQR 14·0-17·6), 554 (27·7%) patients in the IM-MS irradiation group and 569 (28·4%) patients in the control group had died. Overall survival was 73·1% (95% CI 71·0-75·2) in the IM-MS irradiation group and 70·9% (68·6-72·9) in the control group (HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·84-1·06], p=0·36). Any breast cancer recurrence (24·5% [95% CI 22·5-26·6] vs 27·1% [25·1-29·2]; HR 0·87 [95% CI 0·77-0·98], p=0·024) and breast cancer mortality (16·0% [14·3-17·7] vs 19·8% [18·0-21·7]; 0·81 [0·70-0·94], p=0·0055) were lower in the IM-MS irradiation group than in the control group. No significant differences in the IM-MS irradiation group versus the control group were seen for disease-free survival (60·8% [95% CI 58·4-63·2] vs 59·9% [57·5-62·2]; HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·84-1·03], p=0·18), or distant metastasis-free survival (70·0% [67·7-72·2] vs 68·2% [65·9-70·3]; 0·93 [0·83-1·04], p=0·18). Causes of death between groups were similar.",

We conducted a single-centre randomized phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of adding platinum to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients.",
        "Methods": "Patients with histopathological diagnosis of TNBC without evidence of distant metastases who were planned to be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were randomized to experimental or control arms after stratification by menopausal status (premenopausal or perimenopausal, and postmenopausal) and stage [operable breast cancer (OBC, clinical T1-3, N0-1, M0), and locally advanced breast cancer (LABC, cT4 or N2-3, M0)]. NACT in control arm included paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 once per week for 8 weeks followed by doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (90 mg/m2) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) once every 21 days for 4 cycles while in experimental arm carboplatin (area-under-curve 2) was added once per week for 8 weeks with paclitaxel. After NACT patients received standard surgery for primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (LN) followed by radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), pathological complete response (pCR, absence of invasive cancer from breast and LN), and toxicity.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between April 2010 and January 2020, 720 (355 control, 365 experimental) patients with a median age of 46 (25-69) years [< 50 years, 502 (69.7%), premenopausal 418 (58.2%)], were included in the study, of whom 285 (39.6%) had OBC and 435 (60.4%) had LABC, with a median clinical tumor size of 6.0 (1.2- 20.0) cm. At a median follow-up of 67.6 (18.9-142.2) months, in the experimental and control arms, the 5-year DFS were 70.6% (95% CI 65.7-75.5%) and 64.5% (95% CI 59.4-69.6%), respectively (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02, p=0.073), 5-year OS were 74.0 (95% CI 69.3-78.7%) and 66.7% (95% CI 61.6-71.8%), respectively (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.98, p=0.034), and pCR were 55.2% (95% CI 49.7-69.5%) and 41.5% (95% CI 36.2-47.0%), respectively (p=0.0004). In subgroup analyses, the benefit of carboplatin was confined to patient’s < 50 years, with significant interaction between treatment and age. In women < 50 years of age, in experimental versus control arms, 5-year DFS and OS were 74.5% vs 62.3% (p=0.003, interaction p=0.003) and 76.8% vs 65.7% (p=0.003, interaction p=0.004), respectively. Addition of carboplatin had a significant beneficial impact on OS after adjusting for baseline clinical tumor size and age in a Cox model (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.98, p=0.038). In experimental and control arms, numbers of patients with any grade >/=3 toxicity were 140 (38.5%) and 107/355 (30.14%), respectively, (p=0.02), grade >/=3 neutropenia were 2/364 (0.55%) and 1/355 (0.28%), respectively, grade >/=3 thrombocytopenia were 1/364 (0.27%) and 0 (0%), respectively, and febrile neutropenia were 26/364 (7.14%%) and 18/355 (5.07%), respectively (p=0.25).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study, to our knowledge the largest reported trial of neoadjuvant platinum in TNBC thus far, suggests that addition of carboplatin to sequential taxane-anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in substantial and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free and overall survival in young patients with TNBC and should be the standard of care in these patients.",

Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, in the cohort with PIK3CA-mutated cancer; progression-free survival was also analyzed in the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer. Secondary end points included overall response and safety.",

Overall response among all the patients in the cohort with PIK3CA-mutated cancer was greater with alpelisib–fulvestrant than with placebo–fulvestrant (26.6% vs. 12.8%); among patients with measurable disease in this cohort, the percentages were 35.7% and 16.2%, respectively. In the overall population, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hyperglycemia (36.6% in the alpelisib–fulvestrant group vs. 0.7% in the placebo–fulvestrant group) and rash (9.9% vs. 0.3%). Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7% of patients in the alpelisib–fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3% of those in the placebo–fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported.

Mathematical models suggest a fixed dose, dose dense (7 days on, 7 days off) schedule may be optimal for capecitabine efficacy. We conducted a randomized trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose capecitabine, 1500 mg twice daily, 7 days on, 7 days off (FD) to the FDA approved dose and schedule (SD).",

Rx is weekly (w) paclitaxel (80mg/m2), q3w trastuzumab (loading dose 8mg/kg → 6mg/kg), and q3w pertuzumab (flat loading dose 840mg → 420mg). The primary endpoint is PFS at 6 months (mo). Evaluable pts are those who started study Rx and are assessed at 6 mo for PFS, including pts who progressed prior to 6mo. Secondary endpoints include response, safety (including cardiac events), and tolerability. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is monitored by echocardiogram every 3 mo. Cardiac events are defined as symptomatic LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD), non-LVSD cardiac death, or probable cardiac death.",
        "Results/Findings": "As of 1-18-13, 53 pts are enrolled; 36 are evaluable at 6 mo. At 6 mo, 29/36 pts (81%) are progression-free (4 CR, 14 PR and 11 SD); 7 pts progressed. The 6 mo PFS results for all patients will be updated. Median LVEF is 64% at baseline (range 50-72%), 63% at 3 mo (range 50-73%), and 62% at 6 mo (range 49-69%). There are no cardiac events to date. Of the 36 pts, grade 3/4 toxicities include fatigue (3 pts, 8%), peripheral neuropathy (2 pts, 6%), sepsis (1pt, 3%), cellulitis (1pt, 3%), neutropenia (1pt, 3%), and skin ulceration (1pt, 3%). There are no grade 3 diarrhea or febrile neutropenic events in the evaluable pts to date.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The preliminary 6-month PFS is 81% (95% CI 67-91%) in evaluable patients. The study is closing to accrual. Treatment is ongoing, with few grade 3/4 toxicities and no signal of increased cardiac toxicity to date. This phase II study demonstrates efficacy and safety for pertuzumab with trastuzumab and weekly paclitaxel in HER2+ MBC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "Dostarlimab is an investigational, humanized programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor monoclonal antibody that blocks interaction with the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. GARNET (NCT02715284) is a phase 1 study assessing the antitumor activity and safety of dostarlimab monotherapy in patients with solid tumors.",
        "Methods": "This multicenter, open-label, single-arm study is being conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and expansion. Here we report on the 2 expansion cohorts that enrolled mismatch repair–deficient/microsatellite instability–high (dMMR/MSI-H) patients. Cohort A1 enrolled patients with advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer (EC), and cohort F enrolled patients with advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H or POLε-hypermutated non-EC solid tumors, mainly gastrointestinal (GI) tumors (99 [93.4%] had GI tumors, including 69 [65.1%] with colorectal cancer). Patients received 500 mg IV of dostarlimab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then 1000 mg IV every 6 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by RECIST v1.1. Here we report ORR and DOR, by individual cohort and as an overall population, in patients with dMMR tumors identified by immunohistochemistry testing.",
        "Results/Findings": "For this interim analysis, an efficacy analysis was performed for the patients who had baseline measurable disease and ≥6 months of follow-up in the study (N = 209). The ORR was 41.6% (95% CI, 34.9%–48.6%) for the combined A1+F dMMR cohorts (Table). Responses were durable, and median DOR has not been reached in either cohort (median follow-up: cohort A1, 16.3 months; cohort F, 12.4 months). A total of 267 patients were included in the safety population (all patients who received ≥1 dose; cohort A1, N = 126; cohort F, N = 141). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were consistent across tumor types. Overall, the most frequently reported any-grade TRAEs were asthenia (13.9%), diarrhea (13.5%), and fatigue (11.2%). The most common grade ≥3 TRAEs were anemia (2.2%), lipase increased (1.9%), alanine aminotransferase increased (1.1%), and diarrhea (1.1%). No deaths were attributed to dostarlimab.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Dostarlimab demonstrated durable antitumor activity in patients with dMMR solid tumors, with consistent antitumor activity seen across endometrial and nonendometrial tumor types. The safety profile was manageable, with no new safety signals detected. Most TRAEs were low grade and were similar across cohorts",
