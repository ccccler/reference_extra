        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We did this non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 62 centres in Italy. We enrolled patients with breast cancer who had one or more bone metastases and had completed 12-15 months of monthly treatment with zoledronic acid. Patients were randomly assigned with a permutated block (size four to eight) random list stratified by centre in a 1:1 ratio to zoledronic acid 4 mg once every 12 weeks or once every 4 weeks, and followed up for at least 1 year. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was skeletal morbidity rate (skeletal-related events per patient per year) in the intention-to-treat population. We used a non-inferiority margin of 0.19. The trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2005-004942-15.",
        "Results/Findings": "We screened 430 patients and enrolled 425, of whom 209 were assigned to the 12-week group and 216 to the 4-week group. The skeletal morbidity rate was 0.26 (95% CI 0.15-0.37) in the 12-week group versus 0.22 (0.14-0.29) in the 4-week group. The between-group difference was 0.04 and the upper limit of one-tailed 97.5% CI was 0.17, which is lower than the non-inferiority margin. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were bone pain (56 [27%] patients in the 12-week group vs 65 [30%] in the 4-week group), nausea (24 [11%] vs 33 [15%]), and asthenia (18 [9%] vs 33 [15%]). Renal adverse events occurred in one patient (<1%) in the 12-week group versus two (1%) in the 4-week group. One patient (<1%) in the 4-week group had grade 1 acute renal failure. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in four patients in the 12-week group versus three in the 4-week group. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Median N-terminal telopeptide concentration changed from baseline more in the 12-week group than in the 4-week group after 12 months (12.2% vs 0.0%; p=0.011).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results raise the possibility of decreasing administration of zoledronic acid to a 12-weekly regimen to reduce exposure during the second year, while maintaining its therapeutic effects. However, the effects on N-terminal telopeptide should be investigated further before changing current practice.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Between 1993 and 1999, 130 patients age 40 years or younger with stage I or II breast cancer were treated with BCT. The median radiation dose to the tumor bed was 61 Gy; 80% of patients received chemotherapy; and 29% of 72 patients with estrogen-receptor positive tumors received tamoxifen. Median follow-up was 93 months.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fifteen patients (12%) developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), with or without other simultaneous failure sites. The Kaplan-Meier 5- and 8-year actuarial rates were 8% and 14%, respectively. The 74 patients with grade 3 tumors had a higher IBTR rate (8-year actuarial rate, 18%) than the 54 patients with grade 1-2 lesions (7%) (P = 0.09). Six patients developed contralateral breast cancers, and 17 developed distant metastases (DM). The 8-year actuarial rates for freedom-from-DM, relapse-free survival, and overall survival were 85%, 72% and 96%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This represents one of the largest series of young women treated with BCT, using an approach similar to current practice. The IBTR rate was substantially lower than in many past studies, but still higher than would be expected for older women. This appeared largely due to the increased rate of IBTR in patients with grade 3 tumors. If this observation is confirmed, further analysis of this subgroup may lead to ways of reducing the risk of IBTR.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The diverse group of young cancer survivors in this study identified several common needs and concerns regarding fertility and parenthood. This study illustrates that young survivors could benefit from improved information regarding their fertility and parenthood options throughout survivorship, better coordination of medical care, and support navigating many emotional and practical issues that arise when considering their reproductive and parenthood options.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 16,023 patients with stage IV disease were identified in the NCDB during this period, of whom 6861 (42.8%) received either no operation or a variety of diagnostic or palliative procedures, and 9162 (57.2%) underwent partial (3513) or total (5649) mastectomy. The presence of free surgical margins was associated with an improvement in 3-year survival in partial or total mastectomy groups (26% vs 35%, respectively). A multivariate proportional hazards model identified the number of metastatic sites, the type of metastatic burden, and the extent of resection of the primary tumor as significant independent prognostic covariates. Women treated with surgical resection with free margins, when compared with those not surgically treated, had superior prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.58,0.65).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data suggest that the role of local therapy in women with stage IV breast cancer needs to be re-evaluated, and local therapy plus systemic therapy should be compared with systemic therapy alone in a randomized trial.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We did this randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) in 154 clinical centres in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and Israel. Adult women (>18 years) with early-stage (0, I, or II; no evidence of distant metastases, but up to three axillary nodes could be positive) breast cancer (tumour size ≤3 cm; including all histologies and multifocal breast cancers), who had had lumpectomy with negative (ie, no detectable cancer cells) surgical margins, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a biased-coin-based minimisation algorithm to receive either whole-breast irradiation (whole-breast irradiation group) or APBI (APBI group). Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38·5 Gy of external bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period. Randomisation was stratified by disease stage, menopausal status, hormone-receptor status, and intention to receive chemotherapy. Patients, investigators, and statisticians could not be masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome of invasive and non-invasive IBTR as a first recurrence was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, excluding those patients who were lost to follow-up, with an equivalency test on the basis of a 50% margin increase in the hazard ratio (90% CI for the observed HR between 0·667 and 1·5 for equivalence) and a Cox proportional hazard model. Survival was assessed by intention to treat, and sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between March 21, 2005, and April 16, 2013, 4216 women were enrolled. 2109 were assigned to the whole-breast irradiation group and 2107 were assigned to the APBI group. 70 patients from the whole-breast irradiation group and 14 from the APBI group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up at this stage, so 2039 and 2093 patients respectively were available for survival analysis. Further, three and four patients respectively were lost to clinical follow-up (ie, survival status was assessed by phone but no physical examination was done), leaving 2036 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in the APBI group evaluable for the primary outcome. At a median follow-up of 10·2 years (IQR 7·5-11·5), 90 (4%) of 2089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an IBTR (HR 1·22, 90% CI 0·94-1·58). The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 4·6% (95% CI 3·7-5·7) in the APBI group versus 3·9% (3·1-5·0) in the whole-breast irradiation group. 44 (2%) of 2039 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 49 (2%) of 2093 patients in the APBI group died from recurring breast cancer. There were no treatment-related deaths. Second cancers and treatment-related toxicities were similar between the two groups. 2020 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in APBI group had available data on adverse events. The highest toxicity grade reported was: grade 1 in 845 (40%), grade 2 in 921 (44%), and grade 3 in 201 (10%) patients in the APBI group, compared with grade 1 in 626 (31%), grade 2 in 1193 (59%), and grade 3 in 143 (7%) in the whole-breast irradiation group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "APBI did not meet the criteria for equivalence to whole-breast irradiation in controlling IBTR for breast-conserving therapy. Our trial had broad eligibility criteria, leading to a large, heterogeneous pool of patients and sufficient power to detect treatment equivalence, but was not designed to test equivalence in patient subgroups or outcomes from different APBI techniques. For patients with early-stage breast cancer, our findings support whole-breast irradiation following lumpectomy; however, with an absolute difference of less than 1% in the 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR, APBI might be an acceptable alternative for some women.",

        "Methods": "We did this multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial in 33 cancer centres in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Women aged 40 years or older with ductal carcinoma in situ or node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either external beam APBI (38·5 Gy in ten fractions delivered twice per day over 5-8 days) or whole breast irradiation (42·5 Gy in 16 fractions once per day over 21 days, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions once per day over 35 days). Patients and clinicans were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR), analysed by intention to treat. The trial was designed on the basis of an expected 5 year IBTR rate of 1·5% in the whole breast irradiation group with 85% power to exclude a 1·5% increase in the APBI group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the IBTR hazard ratio (HR) was less than 2·02. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 7, 2006, and July 15, 2011, we enrolled 2135 women. 1070 were randomly assigned to receive APBI and 1065 were assigned to receive whole breast irradiation. Six patients in the APBI group withdrew before treatment, four more did not receive radiotherapy, and 16 patients received whole breast irradiation. In the whole breast irradiation group, 16 patients withdrew, and two more did not receive radiotherapy. In the APBI group, a further 14 patients were lost to follow-up and nine patients withdrew during the follow-up period. In the whole breast irradiation group, 20 patients were lost to follow-up and 35 withdrew during follow-up. Median follow-up was 8·6 years (IQR 7·3-9·9). The 8-year cumulative rates of IBTR were 3·0% (95% CI 1·9-4·0) in the APBI group and 2·8% (1·8-3·9) in the whole breast irradiation group. The HR for APBI versus whole breast radiation was 1·27 (90% CI 0·84-1·91). Acute radiation toxicity (grade ≥2, within 3 months of radiotherapy start) occurred less frequently in patients treated with APBI (300 [28%] of 1070 patients) than whole breast irradiation (484 [45%] of 1065 patients, p<0·0001). Late radiation toxicity (grade ≥2, later than 3 months) was more common in patients treated with APBI (346 [32%] of 1070 patients) than whole breast irradiation (142 [13%] of 1065 patients; p<0·0001). Adverse cosmesis (defined as fair or poor) was more common in patients treated with APBI than in those treated by whole breast irradiation at 3 years (absolute difference, 11·3%, 95% CI 7·5-15·0), 5 years (16·5%, 12·5-20·4), and 7 years (17·7%, 12·9-22·3).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "External beam APBI was non-inferior to whole breast irradiation in preventing IBTR. Although less acute toxicity was observed, the regimen used was associated with an increase in moderate late toxicity and adverse cosmesis, which might be related to the twice per day treatment. Other approaches, such as treatment once per day, might not adversely affect cosmesis and should be studied.",

        "Methods": "We randomly assigned patients to receive either anastrozole or fulvestrant plus anastrozole. Randomization was stratified according to adjuvant tamoxifen use. Analysis of survival was performed by means of two-sided stratified log-rank tests and Cox regression. Efficacy and safety were compared between the two groups, both overall and in subgroups.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 707 patients who had undergone randomization, 694 had data available for analysis. The combination-therapy group had 247 deaths among 349 women (71%) and a median overall survival of 49.8 months, as compared with 261 deaths among 345 women (76%) and a median overall survival of 42.0 months in the anastrozole-alone group, a significant difference (hazard ratio for death, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.98; P = 0.03 by the log-rank test). In a subgroup analysis of the two strata, overall survival among women who had not received tamoxifen previously was longer with the combination therapy than with anastrozole alone (median, 52.2 months and 40.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.92); among women who had received tamoxifen previously, overall survival was similar in the two groups (median, 48.2 months and 43.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.27) (P = 0.09 for interaction). The incidence of long-term toxic effects of grade 3 to 5 was similar in the two groups. Approximately 45% of the patients in the anastrozole-alone group crossed over to receive fulvestrant.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of fulvestrant to anastrozole was associated with increased long-term survival as compared with anastrozole alone, despite substantial crossover to fulvestrant after progression during therapy with anastrozole alone. The results suggest that the benefit was particularly notable in patients without previous exposure to adjuvant endocrine therapy.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive routine medical care, including mammography, ultrasound and lesion sampling by large core needle biopsy or additional MRI preceding biopsy. Patients with cancer were referred for surgery. Primary end-point was the rate of additional surgical procedures (re-excisions and conversion to mastectomy) in patients with a nonpalpable breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "Four hundred and eighteen patients were randomised, 207 patients were allocated to MRI, and 211 patients to the control group. In the MRI group 74 patients had 83 malignant lesions, compared to 75 patients with 80 malignant lesions in the control group. The primary breast conserving surgery (BCS) rate was similar in both groups; 68% in the MRI group versus 66% in the control group. The number of re-excisions performed because of positive resection margins after primary BCS was increased in the MRI group; 18/53 (34%) patients in the MRI group versus 6/50 (12%) in the control group (p=0.008). The number of conversions to mastectomy did not differ significantly between groups. Overall, the rate of an additional surgical intervention (BCS and mastectomy combined) after initial breast conserving surgery was 24/53 (45%) in the MRI group versus 14/50 (28%) in the control group (p=0.069).",

        "Results/Findings": "The rate of local relapse at five years was 7.7 percent in the tamoxifen group and 0.6 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation (hazard ratio, 8.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.3 to 21.2; P<0.001), with corresponding five-year disease-free survival rates of 84 percent and 91 percent (P=0.004). A planned subgroup analysis of 611 women with T1, receptor-positive tumors indicated a benefit from radiotherapy (five-year rates of local relapse, 0.4 percent with tamoxifen plus radiotherapy and 5.9 percent with tamoxifen alone; P<0.001). Overall, there was a significant difference in the rate of axillary relapse at five years (2.5 percent in the tamoxifen group and 0.5 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation, P=0.049), but no significant difference in the rates of distant relapse or overall survival.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "As compared with tamoxifen alone, radiotherapy plus tamoxifen significantly reduces the risk of breast and axillary recurrence after lumpectomy in women with small, node-negative, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers.",

After 1976, patients in both groups who had positive axillary nodes also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.",
        "Results/Findings": "Thirty women in the group that underwent breast-conserving therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the same breast, whereas eight women in the radical-mastectomy group had local recurrences (P<0.001). The crude cumulative incidence of these events was 8.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, after 20 years. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rates of contralateral-breast carcinomas, distant metastases, or second primary cancers. After a median follow-up of 20 years, the rate of death from all causes was 41.7 percent in the group that underwent breast-conserving surgery and 41.2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group (P=1.0).

        "Methods": "A total of 160 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast cancer were matched with 445 controls with sporadic breast cancer. Primary end points were rates of in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and contralateral breast cancers (CBCs). Median follow-up was 7.9 years for mutation carriers and 6.7 years for controls.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no significant difference in IBTR overall between carriers and controls; 10- and 15-year estimates were 12% and 24% for carriers and 9% and 17% for controls, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; P = .19). Multivariate analyses for IBTR found BRCA1/2 mutation status to be an independent predictor of IBTR when carriers who had undergone oophorectomy were removed from analysis (HR, 1.99; P = .04); the incidence of IBTR in carriers who had undergone oophorectomy was not significantly different from that in sporadic controls (P = .37). CBCs were significantly greater in carriers versus controls, with 10- and 15-year estimates of 26% and 39% for carriers and 3% and 7% for controls, respectively (HR, 10.43; P < .0001). Tamoxifen use significantly reduced risk of CBCs in mutation carriers (HR, 0.31; P = .05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "IBTR risk at 10 years is similar in BRCA1/2 carriers treated with breast conservation surgery who undergo oophorectomy versus sporadic controls. As expected, CBCs are significantly increased in carriers. Although the incidence of CBCs was significantly reduced in mutation carriers who received tamoxifen, this rate remained significantly greater than in controls.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients aged 18 years or older, with small (≤3 cm), node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, were recruited from 16 institutions in 13 cities in the USA. Eligible patients were given intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m ) with intravenous trastuzumab (loading dose of 4 mg/kg, subsequent doses 2 mg/kg) weekly for 12 weeks, followed by trastuzumab (weekly at 2 mg/kg or once every 3 weeks at 6 mg/kg) for 40 weeks to complete a full year of trastuzumab. The primary endpoint was 3-year invasive disease-free survival. Here, we report 10-year survival outcomes, assessed in all participants who received protocol-defined treatment, with exploratory analyses using the HER2DX genomic tool. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is closed to accrual.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 29, 2007, and Sept 3, 2010, 410 patients were enrolled and 406 were given adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab and included in the analysis. Mean age at enrolment was 55 years (SD 10·5), 405 (99·8%) of 406 patients were female and one (0·2%) was male, 350 (86·2%) were White, 28 (6·9%) were Black or African American, and 272 (67·0%) had hormone receptor-positive disease. After a median follow-up of 10·8 years (IQR 7·1-11·4), among 406 patients included in the analysis population, we observed 31 invasive disease-free survival events, of which six (19·4%) were locoregional ipsilateral recurrences, nine (29·0%) were new contralateral breast cancers, six (19·4%) were distant recurrences, and ten (32·3%) were all-cause deaths. 10-year invasive disease-free survival was 91·3% (95% CI 88·3-94·4), 10-year recurrence-free interval was 96·3% (95% CI 94·3-98·3), 10-year overall survival was 94·3% (95% CI 91·8-96·8), and 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 98·8% (95% CI 97·6-100). HER2DX risk score as a continuous variable was significantly associated with invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-unit increment 1·24 [95% CI 1·00-1·52]; p=0·047) and recurrence-free interval (1·45 [1·09-1·93]; p=0·011).",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "FAST-Forward is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial done at 97 hospitals (47 radiotherapy centres and 50 referring hospitals) in the UK. Patients aged at least 18 years with invasive carcinoma of the breast (pT1-3, pN0-1, M0) after breast conservation surgery or mastectomy were eligible. We randomly allocated patients to either 40 Gy in 15 fractions (over 3 weeks), 27 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week), or 26 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week) to the whole breast or chest wall. Allocation was not masked because of the nature of the intervention. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour relapse; assuming a 2% 5-year incidence for 40 Gy, non-inferiority was predefined as ≤1·6% excess for five-fraction schedules (critical hazard ratio [HR] of 1·81). Normal tissue effects were assessed by clinicians, patients, and from photographs. This trial is registered at isrctn.com, ISRCTN19906132.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Nov 24, 2011, and June 19, 2014, we recruited and obtained consent from 4096 patients from 97 UK centres, of whom 1361 were assigned to the 40 Gy schedule, 1367 to the 27 Gy schedule, and 1368 to the 26 Gy schedule. At a median follow-up of 71·5 months (IQR 71·3 to 71·7), the primary endpoint event occurred in 79 patients (31 in the 40 Gy group, 27 in the 27 Gy group, and 21 in the 26 Gy group); HRs versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 0·86 (95% CI 0·51 to 1·44) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 0·67 (0·38 to 1·16) for 26 Gy in five fractions. 5-year incidence of ipsilateral breast tumour relapse after 40 Gy was 2·1% (1·4 to 3·1); estimated absolute differences versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were -0·3% (-1·0 to 0·9) for 27 Gy in five fractions (probability of incorrectly accepting an inferior five-fraction schedule: p=0·0022 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions) and -0·7% (-1·3 to 0·3) for 26 Gy in five fractions (p=0·00019 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions). At 5 years, any moderate or marked clinician-assessed normal tissue effects in the breast or chest wall was reported for 98 of 986 (9·9%) 40 Gy patients, 155 (15·4%) of 1005 27 Gy patients, and 121 of 1020 (11·9%) 26 Gy patients. Across all clinician assessments from 1-5 years, odds ratios versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 1·55 (95% CI 1·32 to 1·83, p<0·0001) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 1·12 (0·94 to 1·34, p=0·20) for 26 Gy in five fractions. Patient and photographic assessments showed higher normal tissue effect risk for 27 Gy versus 40 Gy but not for 26 Gy versus 40 Gy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "26 Gy in five fractions over 1 week is non-inferior to the standard of 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for local tumour control, and is as safe in terms of normal tissue effects up to 5 years for patients prescribed adjuvant local radiotherapy after primary surgery for early-stage breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In this phase III, multicentre, open-label, randomised study, 252 women with locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer who had been pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes were randomly assigned single-agent vinorelbine (30 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8) or gemcitabine plus vinorelbine (1200/30 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8). Both study treatments were administered intravenously every 21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or stoppage at the request of investigator or patient. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included assessments of response rate, disease duration, overall survival, and characterisation of the toxicity profiles of both regimens. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between 2001 and 2005, 252 women were recruited and randomised for treatment. One of these patients was ineligible. Prognostic factors were well balanced between treatment groups (median number of metastatic sites in combination group 2 (range 0-5) and in vinorelbine group 2 (range 1-6); visceral disease in 76% and 75% of patients, respectively). Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI 4.8-7.1) for patients given gemcitabine plus vinorelbine and 4.0 months (2.9-5.1) for those assigned vinorelbine; there was 1.9 months of difference (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.50-0.88]; p=0.0028). Overall survival was 15.9 months (12.6-19.1) for the gemcitabine plus vinorelbine group and 16.4 months (11.6-21.0) for the vinorelbine group; there was 0.5 months of difference (hazard ratio 1.04 [0.78-1.39]; p=0.8046). Objective response rates were 36% for patients assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine (n=45) and 26% for those assigned vinorelbine (n=33) (p=0.093). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 75 (61% [52-70]) of the participants assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, compared with 55 (44% [35-53]) of those assigned vinorelbine alone (p=0.0074). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 13 (11%) of those assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, and in seven (6%) of those assigned vinorelbine alone (p=0.15). Incidences of grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxic effects were similar between the two treatment groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with metastatic breast cancer assigned gemcitabine and vinorelbine had better progression-free survival compared with those assigned vinorelbine alone. However, this finding did not translate into a difference in overall survival. Although toxicity was manageable, patients in the combined group had more haematological toxic effects. These factors should be taken into account when deciding which chemotherapy patients should receive.",

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (ie, unresectable or metastatic, or both) incurable solid tumour (eligible tumour types were anal, biliary, cervical, endometrial, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small-cell lung, thyroid, and vulvar), progression on or intolerance to one or more lines of standard therapy, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) assessed by independent central radiological review, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 3 months, adequate organ function, and a tumour sample for biomarker analysis. Participants were given pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Tissue TMB (tTMB) was assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples using the FoundationOne CDx assay (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA). The prespecified definition of tTMB-high status was at least 10 mutations per megabase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (version 1.1) by independent central review. This prespecified analysis assessed the association between antitumour activity and tTMB in treated patients with evaluable tTMB data. Efficacy was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab, had evaluable tTMB data, and were enrolled at least 26 weeks before data cutoff (June 27, 2019), and safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and had tTMB-high status. KEYNOTE-158 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 15, 2016, and June 25, 2019, 1073 patients were enrolled. 1066 participants were treated as of data cutoff (June 27, 2019), of whom 805 (76%) were evaluable for TMB, and 105 (13%) of 805 had tTMB-high status and were assessed for safety. 1050 (98%) of 1066 patients enrolled by at least 26 weeks before data cutoff, of whom 790 (75%) were evaluable for TMB and included in efficacy analyses. 102 (13%) of these 790 patients had tTMB-high status (≥10 mutations per megabase), and 688 (87%) patients had non-tTMB-high status (<10 mutations per megabase). Median study follow-up was 37·1 months (IQR 35·0-38·3). Objective responses were observed in 30 (29%; 95% CI 21-39) of 102 patients in the tTMB-high group and 43 (6%; 5-8) of 688 in the non-tTMB-high group. 11 (10%) of 105 patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. 16 (15%) participants had a grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event, of which colitis was the only such adverse event that occurred in more than one patient (n=2).

Ninety-two patients maintained the same tumor phenotype [i.e. the same hormone receptors (HR) and HER2 status], whereas 27 (22.7%) changed during progression. The loss of HR positivity and the loss of HER2 positivity resulted in a worse post-recurrence survival (P=0.01 and P=0.008, respectively) and overall survival (OS; P=0.06 and P=0.0002, respectively), compared with the corresponding concordant-positive cases.

        "Methods": "In this international, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II/III trial, the efficacy and safety of first-line nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine or with carboplatin will be compared with gemcitabine/carboplatin (control arm) for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",
        "Results/Findings": "In the phase II portion, 240 patients with measurable metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and treatment-naive for metastatic disease will be randomized 1:1:1 (stratified by disease-free interval: ≤1 versus>1 year) to nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 plus carboplatin area under the curve 2 mg×min/mL, or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 plus carboplatin area under the curve 2 mg×min/mL, all given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival (primary endpoint), overall response rate, overall survival, and safety will be assessed. A ranking algorithm of five efficacy and safety parameters will be used to pick the \"winner\" of the nab-paclitaxel regimens. In the phase III portion, 550 patients will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by disease-free interval: ≤1 versus >1 year, and prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant taxane use) to the nab-paclitaxel combination arm selected from the phase II portion or to the control arm. Patients in phase II will not be part of the phase III population. The phase III primary endpoint is blinded, independently-assessed progression-free survival; secondary endpoints include blinded, independently-assessed overall response rate, overall survival, disease control rate, duration of response, and safety. Biomarker and circulating tumor-cell exploratory analyses and quality-of-life assessments will also be performed. A list of approving ethical bodies was provided in Additional file 1.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Analysis of a prospectively collected clinical database was performed. We included 1,118 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for stage I-III breast cancer from 1985 to 2004 and for whom complete receptor information were available. Clinical and pathologic parameters, pathologic complete response rates (pCR), survival measurements, and organ-specific relapse rates were compared between patients with TNBC and non-TNBC.",
        "Results/Findings": "Two hundred fifty-five patients (23%) had TNBC. Patients with TNBC compared with non-TNBC had significantly higher pCR rates (22% v 11%; P = .034), but decreased 3-year progression-free survival rates (P < .0001) and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates (P < .0001). TNBC was associated with increased risk for visceral metastases (P = .0005), lower risk for bone recurrence (P = .027), and shorter postrecurrence survival (P < .0001). Recurrence and death rates were higher for TNBC only in the first 3 years. If pCR was achieved, patients with TNBC and non-TNBC had similar survival (P = .24). In contrast, patients with residual disease (RD) had worse OS if they had TNBC compared with non-TNBC (P < .0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients with TNBC have increased pCR rates compared with non-TNBC, and those with pCR have excellent survival. However, patients with RD after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have significantly worse survival if they have TNBC compared with non-TNBC, particularly in the first 3 years.",

A skeletal-related event (SRE) was defined as a pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiotherapy, or surgery to bone.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among all patients with BC, the proportion of those who had an SRE (primary endpoint) was comparable between treatment groups (43% of patients who received 4 mg of Zol vs. 45% of patients who received Pam). Among patients who had breast carcinoma with at least 1 osteolytic lesion (n = 528 patients), the proportion with an SRE was lower in the 4-mg Zol group compared with the Pam group (48% vs. 58%), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.058). The time to first SRE was significantly longer in the 4-mg Zol group compared with the Pam group (median, 310 vs. 174 days; P = 0.013). Moreover, multiple-event analysis demonstrated significant further reductions in the risk of developing SREs over the reduction achieved with Pam (30% in the osteolytic subset [P = 0.010] and 20% for all patients with BC [P = 0.037]).",

        "Results/Findings": "We enrolled 1918 women. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there were 165 events involving disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (67 with letrozole and 98 with placebo) and 200 deaths (100 in each group). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 96) with letrozole and 91% (95% CI; 89 to 93) with placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, 0.66; P=0.01 by a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to nodal status, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, the interval from the last dose of aromatase-inhibitor therapy, and the duration of treatment with tamoxifen). The rate of 5-year overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with letrozole and 94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.97; P=0.83). The annual incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in the letrozole group was 0.21% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32), and the rate in the placebo group was 0.49% (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.67) (hazard ratio, 0.42; P=0.007).

We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs).",
        "Results/Findings": "Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p<0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p<0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p<0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p<0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p<0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, -0·3 to 1·1; p=0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0-1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2-4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5-9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1-3, and N4+ disease).",

        "Methods": "Patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m(2) body-surface area on days 1 through 14 [1,250 mg/m(2) semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body weight) in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was time to progression.",
        "Results/Findings": "We randomly assigned 78 patients to capecitabine and 78 patients to capecitabine plus trastuzumab. Sixty-five events and 38 deaths in the capecitabine group and 62 events and 33 deaths in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group occurred during 15.6 months of follow-up. Median times to progression were 5.6 months in the capecitabine group and 8.2 months in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97; two-sided log-rank P = .0338). Overall survival rates were 20.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 24.7) in the capecitabine group and 25.5 months (95% CI, 19.0 to 30.7) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (P = .257). Overall response rates were 27.0% with capecitabine and 48.1% with capecitabine plus trastuzumab (odds ratio, 2.50; P = .0115). Continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression was not associated with increased toxicity.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed a significant improvement in overall response and time to progression compared with capecitabine alone in women with HER-2-positive breast cancer who experienced progression during trastuzumab treatment.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-31 compared doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel with AC followed by paclitaxel plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab beginning concurrently with paclitaxel in patients with node-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer. Initiation of trastuzumab required normal post-AC left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on multiple-gated acquisition scan. If symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) developed, source documents were blindly reviewed by an independent panel of cardiologists to determine whether criteria were met for a cardiac event (CE), which was defined as New York Heart Association class III or IV CHF or possible/probable cardiac death. Frequencies of CEs were compared between arms.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among patients with normal post-AC LVEF who began post-AC treatment, five of 814 control patients subsequently had confirmed CEs (four CHFs and one cardiac death) compared with 31 of 850 trastuzumab-treated patients (31 CHFs and no cardiac deaths). The difference in cumulative incidence at 3 years was 3.3% (4.1% for trastuzumab-treated patients minus 0.8% for control patients; 95% CI, 1.7% to 4.9%). Twenty-seven of the 31 patients in the trastuzumab arm have been followed for > or = 6 months after diagnosis of a CE; 26 were asymptomatic at last assessment, and 18 remained on cardiac medication. CHFs were more frequent in older patients and patients with marginal post-AC LVEF. Fourteen percent of patients discontinued trastuzumab because of asymptomatic decreases in LVEF; 4% discontinued trastuzumab because of symptomatic cardiotoxicity.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Administering trastuzumab with paclitaxel after AC increases incidence of CHF and lesser CD. Potential cardiotoxicity should be carefully considered when discussing benefits and risks of this therapy.",

        "Methods": "Patients with HER2-positive (2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry) stage II or III breast cancer received preoperative trastuzumab (4 mg/kg x 1, then 2 mg/kg/wk x 11) in combination with paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks x 4). Patients received adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy following definitive breast surgery. Clinical and pathologic response rates were determined after preoperative therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction and circulating levels of HER2 extracellular domain were measured serially.",
        "Results/Findings": "Preoperative trastuzumab and paclitaxel achieved clinical response in 75% and complete pathologic response in 18% of the 40 women on study. HER2 3+ tumors were more likely to respond than 2+ tumors (84% v 38%). No unexpected treatment-related noncardiac toxicity was encountered. Four patients developed grade 2 cardiotoxicity (asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction). Baseline HER2 extracellular domain was elevated in 24% of patients and declined with preoperative therapy. Immunohistochemical analyses of posttherapy tumor specimens indicated varying patterns of HER2 expression following trastuzumab-based treatment.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Preoperative trastuzumab and paclitaxel is active against HER2 overexpressing early-stage breast cancer and may be feasible as part of a sequential treatment program including anthracyclines. The observed changes in cardiac function merit further investigation. Correlative analyses of HER2 status may facilitate understanding of tumor response and resistance to targeted therapy.",

In total, 1703 women randomized to 1-year trastuzumab and 1698 women randomized to observation were included in these analyses. Median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint was DFS.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall hazard ratio (HR) for trastuzumab versus observation was 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.76; P < 0.0001], ranging from 0.46 to 0.82 for subgroups. Estimated improvement in 3-year DFS in subgroups ranged from +11.3% to +0.6%. Patients with the best prognosis (those with node-negative disease and tumors 1.1-2.0 cm) had benefit similar to the overall cohort (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.26-1.07; 3-year DFS improvement +4.6%, 95% CI -4.0% to 13.2%).",

        "Methods": "A multidisciplinary international Expert Panel was convened to update the clinical practice guideline recommendations informed by a systematic review of the medical literature.",
        "Results/Findings": "The Expert Panel continues to recommend ER testing of invasive breast cancers by validated immunohistochemistry as the standard for predicting which patients may benefit from endocrine therapy, and no other assays are recommended for this purpose. Breast cancer samples with 1% to 100% of tumor nuclei positive should be interpreted as ER positive. However, the Expert Panel acknowledges that there are limited data on endocrine therapy benefit for cancers with 1% to 10% of cells staining ER positive. Samples with these results should be reported using a new reporting category, ER Low Positive, with a recommended comment. A sample is considered ER negative if < 1% or 0% of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive. Additional strategies recommended to promote optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of cases with an initial low to no ER staining result include establishing a laboratory-specific standard operating procedure describing additional steps used by the laboratory to confirm/adjudicate results. The status of controls should be reported for cases with 0% to 10% staining. Similar principles apply to PgR testing, which is used primarily for prognostic purposes in the setting of an ER-positive cancer. Testing of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for ER is recommended to determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies to reduce risk of future breast cancer, while testing DCIS for PgR is considered optional.

        "Results/Findings": "There were 222 new publications that met inclusion criteria.

After review of the new evidence, the Update Panel concluded that no major, substantive revisions to the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations were warranted, but clarifications were added.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "As part of education and informed consent before cancer therapy, health care providers (including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, gynecologic oncologists, urologists, hematologists, pediatric oncologists, and surgeons) should address the possibility of infertility with patients treated during their reproductive years (or with parents or guardians of children) and be prepared to discuss fertility preservation options and/or to refer all potential patients to appropriate reproductive specialists. Although patients may be focused initially on their cancer diagnosis, the Update Panel encourages providers to advise patients regarding potential threats to fertility as early as possible in the treatment process so as to allow for the widest array of options for fertility preservation. The discussion should be documented. Sperm and embryo cryopreservation as well as oocyte cryopreservation are considered standard practice and are widely available. Other fertility preservation methods should be considered investigational and should be performed by providers with the necessary expertise.",

        "Results/Findings": "Preoperative chemotherapy in operable breast cancer has been shown to improve breast conservation rates as a result of tumor response to therapy. When patients are given preoperative systemic therapy, regimens should be the same as those established as safe and active in the adjuvant setting. At present, there are no data to suggest that systemic treatment should be tailored based on initial tumor response, or based on the extent of residual disease. In operable breast cancer, there seems to be no survival advantage from initiation of systemic therapy before surgery. A variety of clinical, imaging, and pathologic measurements are available to gauge tumor response to treatment. There is a clear correlation between tumor response in the breast and lymph nodes and both disease-free and overall survival. Pathologic complete response and other pathologic measures may be useful as surrogate end points in evaluating and understanding new therapies.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In operable breast cancer, preoperative systemic therapy is effective and can improve breast conservation rates. Unless the tumor is large or the patient is in a clinical trial, postoperative adjuvant systemic therapy is the standard of care. To achieve optimal outcomes, preoperative systemic therapy must be administered as part of a coordinated, multimodality treatment program. The preoperative setting provides a unique opportunity to study the impact of systemic therapies on breast cancer biology.",

        "Methods": "A total of 178 patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma were treated in the past 20 years at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center by a combined-modality approach under four different protocols. Each protocol included induction chemotherapy, then local therapy (radiotherapy or mastectomy), then adjuvant chemotherapy, and, if mastectomy was performed, adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with or without vincristine and prednisone (VP). In protocol D, patients received an alternate adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, methotrexate and vinblastine (MV), if they did not have a complete response (CR) to induction chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up of live patients in group A was 215 months, in group B 186 months, in group C 116 months, and in group D 45 months. An estimated 28% of patients were currently free of disease beyond 15 years. At the time of analysis, 50 patients were alive without any evidence of disease. A further 12 patients died of intercurrent illness, and 15 patients were followed beyond 10 years without recurrence of disease. Among initial recurrence, 20% of patients had local failure, 39% systemic failure, and 9% CNS recurrence. Initial response to induction chemotherapy was an important prognostic factor. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 15 years was 44% in patients who had a CR to induction chemotherapy, 31% in those who had a partial response (PR), and 7% in those who had less than a PR. There was no improvement in overall survival (OS) or DFS among patients who underwent alternate chemotherapy (MV) compared with those who did not. Using surgery and radiotherapy as opposed to radiotherapy alone as local therapy did not have an impact on the DFS or OS rate.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These long-term follow-up data show that with a combined-modality approach a significant fraction of patients (28%) remained free of disease beyond 15 years. In contrast, single-modality treatments yielded a DFS of less than 5%. Thus, using combined-modality treatment (chemotherapy, then mastectomy, then chemotherapy and radiotherapy) is recommended as a standard of care for inflammatory breast carcinoma.",

The study was approved by an institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Mammograms and sonograms were reviewed by two mammographers using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) mammographic and US lexicon. US assessment of the regional lymph node basins, including the axillary, infraclavicular, internal mammary, and supraclavicular regions, was documented. US was used to evaluate response to therapy in the breast and the regional lymph nodes in women who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "Between 1998 and 2004, 258 selected patients with low-risk invasive breast carcinoma (pT1 pN0-1mi, grade 1-2, nonlobular breast cancer) resected with negative margins were randomized after breast-conserving surgery to receive PBI (n = 128) or 50 Gy WBI (n = 130). Partial breast irradiation was given either by multicatheter high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT; n = 88) with 7 × 5.2 Gy twice daily or 50 Gy external beam irradiation with electron beams (n = 40).",
        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up time was 17 years. The 20-year actuarial rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were 9.6% versus 7.9% (P = .59) in the PBI and WBI arms, respectively. There was no significant difference in the 20-year probability of disease-free (79.7% vs 78.3%), cancer-specific (92.6% vs 88.1%), and overall survival (59.5% vs 59.7%). Significantly more patients had excellent or good cosmetic result in the PBI and WBI groups (79.2% vs 59.5%; P = .0007).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The 20-year updated results of our phase 3 clinical trial add further scientific evidence that PBI either with multicatheter HDR BT or electron beams for low-risk invasive breast carcinomas yield long-term local tumor control and survival comparable to those achieved with standard WBI. Interstitial HDR BT improved cosmetic results compared with WBI.",

        "Methods": "Women age > 40 years with invasive or in situ breast cancer ≤ 3 cm were randomly assigned after breast-conserving surgery to 3D-CRT APBI (38.5 Gy in 10 fractions twice daily) or WBI (42.5 Gy in 16 or 50 Gy in 25 daily fractions ± boost irradiation). The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Secondary outcomes were cosmesis and toxicity. Adverse cosmesis was defined as a fair or poor global cosmetic score. After a planned interim cosmetic analysis, the data, safety, and monitoring committee recommended release of results. There have been too few IBTR events to trigger an efficacy analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between 2006 and 2011, 2,135 women were randomly assigned to 3D-CRT APBI or WBI. Median follow-up was 36 months. Adverse cosmesis at 3 years was increased among those treated with APBI compared with WBI as assessed by trained nurses (29% v 17%; P < .001), by patients (26% v 18%; P = .0022), and by physicians reviewing digital photographs (35% v 17%; P < .001). Grade 3 toxicities were rare in both treatment arms (1.4% v 0%), but grade 1 and 2 toxicities were increased among those who received APBI compared with WBI (P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "3D-CRT APBI increased rates of adverse cosmesis and late radiation toxicity compared with standard WBI. Clinicians and patients are cautioned against the use of 3D-CRT APBI outside the context of a controlled trial.",

        "Methods": "A total of 110 patients (112 treatment plans) who had mastectomy with immediate reconstruction followed by radiotherapy were compared with contemporaneous stage-matched patients who had undergone mastectomy without intervening reconstruction. A scoring system was used to assess optimal radiotherapy planning using four parameters: breadth of chest wall coverage, treatment of the ipsilateral internal mammary chain, minimization of lung, and avoidance of heart. An \"optimal\" plan achieved all objectives or a minor 0.5 point deduction; \"moderately\" compromised treatment plans had 1.0 or 1.5 point deductions; and \"major\" compromised plans had > or =2.0 point deductions.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 112 PMRT plans scored after reconstruction, 52% had compromises compared with 7% of matched controls (p < 0.0001). Of the compromised plans after reconstruction, 33% were considered to be moderately compromised plans and 19% were major compromised treatment plans. Optimal chest wall coverage, treatment of the ipsilateral internal mammary chain, lung minimization, and heart avoidance was achieved in 79%, 45%, 84%, and 84% of the plans in the group undergoing immediate reconstruction, compared respectively with 100%, 93%, 97%, and 92% of the plans in the control group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0015, and p = 0.1435). In patients with reconstructions, 67% of the \"major\" compromised radiotherapy plans were left-sided (p < 0.16).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Radiation treatment planning after immediate breast reconstruction was compromised in more than half of the patients (52%), with the largest compromises observed in those with left-sided cancers. For patients with locally advanced breast cancer, the potential for compromised PMRT planning should be considered when deciding between immediate and delayed reconstruction.",

There were 1736 underestimates (invasive breast cancer at excision); the random-effects pooled estimate was 25.9% (95% confidence interval: 22.5%, 29.5%). Preoperative variables that showed significant univariate association with higher underestimation included the use of a 14-gauge automated device (vs 11-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy, P = .006), high-grade lesion at CNB (vs non-high grade lesion, P < .001), lesion size larger than 20 mm at imaging (vs lesions ≤ 20 mm, P < .001), Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score of 4 or 5 (vs BI-RADS score of 3, P for trend = .005), mammographic mass (vs calcification only, P < .001), and palpability (P < .001).",

Although treatment is effective, cytotoxic chemotherapy causes ovarian reserve depletion, whereas hormonal therapy necessitates a delay in pregnancy, resulting in infertility. Patients of reproductive age should be referred to fertility specialists to explore methods of fertility preservation upon diagnosis. The best established method of fertility preservation is embryo cryopreservation, although investigational techniques such as, oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, may hold potential. Embryo cryopreservation involves ovarian stimulation to retrieve oocytes in-vitro fertilization prior to freezing. Techniques for the cryopreservation of unfertilized oocytes are under investigation. Successful pregnancies have resulted in breast cancer patients after treatment, without obvious compromise in their risk of recurrence or death from breast cancer.",

Intention to use tamoxifen was balanced between arms (69%); however, actual receipt of tamoxifen varied, 58% RT versus 66% OBS (  = .05). At 13.9 years' median follow-up, the 15-year cumulative incidence of IBR was 7.1% (95% CI, 4.0 to 11.5) with RT versus 15.1% (95% CI, 10.8 to 20.2) OBS (  = .0007; HR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.66); and for invasive LR was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.7 to 9.5) RT versus 9.5% (95% CI, 6.0 to 13.9) OBS (  = .027; HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.91).

TAM was administered to 500 patients. The timing of TAM relative to RT was documented for each patient. Of the 500 patients, the timing of TAM was unclear in five patients, was administered concurrently with RT in 254 patients (CON-TAM), and was administered sequentially after completion of RT in 241 patients (SEQ-TAM).",
        "Results/Findings": "There were no differences between the CON-TAM and SEQ-TAM group in T stage, estrogen and progesterone status, nodal status, histology, or margin status.

Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not used, and chemotherapy was cycled every 3 weeks. For 25 patients who received paclitaxel as initial therapy (group I), the starting dose was 250 mg/m2. Twenty-four patients who had received two or more prior regimens, including an anthracycline (group II), started at 175 mg/m2. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 23 patients in group I.",
        "Results/Findings": "Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included (groups I/II) neutropenia (36%/33%), thrombocytopenia (0%/8%), anemia (0%/13%), neuropathy (8%/0%), arthralgia/myalgia (16%/4%), and mucositis (4%/4%). No significant hypersensitivity-type reactions or cardiac arrhythmias were seen. Six patients who received paclitaxel at > or = 250 mg/m2 experienced transient photopsia, without apparent chronic neuro-ophthalmologic sequelae. The mean peak plasma paclitaxel concentration was 5.87 mumol/L (range, 1.99 to 7.89) for these patients, and 6.08 mumol/L (range, 0.81 to 13.81) for 17 of 19 patients who did not experience visual symptoms. In 25 assessable patients in group I at a median follow-up time of 12 months, one complete response (CR) and seven partial responses (PRs) have been observed, for a total response rate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15% to 53%).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients with measurable disease who had tumor progression while receiving prior anthracycline, taxane, and capecitabine were enrolled. Ixabepilone 40 mg/m(2) monotherapy was administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR), assessed by an independent radiology facility (IRF).",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 126 patients were treated and 113 were assessable for response. Patients were heavily pretreated: 88% had received at least two lines of prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. IRF-assessed ORR was 11.5% (95% CI, 6.3% to 18.9%) for response-assessable patients. Investigator-assessed ORR for all treated patients was 18.3% (95% CI, 11.9% to 26.1%). Fifty percent of patients achieved stable disease (SD); 14.3% achieved SD >or= 6 months. Median duration of response and progression-free survival were 5.7 and 3.1 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 8.6 months. Patients received a median of 4.0 treatment cycles (range, one to 16 cycles), and 25% of patients received >or= eight cycles. Grade 3/4 treatment-related events included peripheral sensory neuropathy (14%), fatigue/asthenia (13%), myalgia (8%), and stomatitis/mucositis (6%). Resolution of grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred after a median period of 5.4 weeks.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Ixabepilone demonstrated clear activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with MBC resistant to anthracycline, taxane, and capecitabine. Responses were durable and notable in patients who had not previously responded to multiple prior therapies.",

Boost treatments consisted of either 16 Gy electron irradiation (n = 52) or 12-14,25 Gy HDR BT (n = 52). Breast cancer-related events, side effects, and cosmetic results were assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the crude rate of local recurrences was 6.7% (7/104) with and 15.5% (16/103) without boost. The 5-year probability of LTC, relapse-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 92.7% vs. 84.9% (p = 0.049), 76.6% vs. 66.2% (p = 0.044), and 90.4% vs. 82.1% (p = 0.053), respectively. There was no significant difference in LTC between patients treated with electron or HDR BT boost (94.2% vs. 91.4%; p = 0.74). On multivariate analysis, patient age < 40 years (RR: 4.53), positive margin status (RR: 4.17), and high mitotic activity index (RR: 3.60) were found to be significant risk factors for local recurrence. The incidence of grade 2-3 side effects was higher in the boost arm (17.3% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.03). However, the rate of excellent/good cosmetic results was similar for the two arms (85.6% vs 91.3%; p = 0.14). Cosmesis was rated as excellent/good in 88.5% of patients treated with HDR BT and 82.7% of patients with electron boost (p = 0.29).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Boost dose significantly improves LTC and RFS in patients treated with BCS and radiotherapy. In spite of the higher incidence of late side effects in the boost arm, boost dose is strongly recommended for patients at high risk for local recurrence. Positive or close margin status, high mitotic activity index, and young patient age should be viewed as absolute indications for tumor bed boost. LTC and cosmesis are excellent and similar to patients boosted with either HDR BT or electrons.",

Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed in each group to evaluate for risk factors for complications. A complication was considered major if it required reoperation. A predictive model was used to compare the 2 groups to one another.",

In the tissue expander/implant population, there was a total complication rate of 31.8% and overall major complication rate of 24.4%. Radiation increased the major complication rate from 21.2 to 45.4%. However, 70.1% of the radiated patients ultimately had a successful implant-based reconstruction while an additional 10.3% went on to have autologous reconstruction. Age and body mass index (BMI) > 30 also led to higher major complication rates in tissue expander/implant reconstruction while smoking, hypertension, and chemotherapy had no impact. In the autologous reconstruction group, there was a total complication rate of 31.5% and a major complication rate of 19.7%. There was no statistically significant difference between the radiated and nonradiated autologous tissue reconstructions with major complication rates of 17.9 and 20.5%, respectively. BMI > 30 was the only significant factor leading to higher major complications in the autologous reconstructions.",

The guideline was reviewed by selected experts and approved by the board of directors for both organizations.",
        "Results/Findings": "Approximately 20% of current HER2 testing may be inaccurate. When carefully validated testing is performed, available data do not clearly demonstrate the superiority of either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) as a predictor of benefit from anti-HER2 therapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The panel recommends that HER2 status should be determined for all invasive breast cancer. A testing algorithm that relies on accurate, reproducible assay performance, including newly available types of brightfield ISH, is proposed. Elements to reliably reduce assay variation (for example, specimen handling, assay exclusion, and reporting criteria) are specified. An algorithm defining positive, equivocal, and negative values for both HER2 protein expression and gene amplification is recommended: a positive HER2 result is IHC staining of 3+ (uniform, intense membrane staining of > 30% of invasive tumor cells), a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) result of more than six HER2 gene copies per nucleus or a FISH ratio (HER2 gene signals to chromosome 17 signals) of more than 2.2; a negative result is an IHC staining of 0 or 1+, a FISH result of less than 4.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or FISH ratio of less than 1.8. Equivocal results require additional action for final determination. It is recommended that to perform HER2 testing, laboratories show 95% concordance with another validated test for positive and negative assay values. The panel strongly recommends validation of laboratory assay or modifications, use of standardized operating procedures, and compliance with new testing criteria to be monitored with the use of stringent laboratory accreditation standards, proficiency testing, and competency assessment. The panel recommends that HER2 testing be done in a CAP-accredited laboratory or in a laboratory that meets the accreditation and proficiency testing requirements set out by this document.",

The panel developed a guideline for clinicians and patients regarding the appropriate use of a sentinel lymph node identification and sampling procedure from hereon referred to as SNB. The guideline was reviewed by selected experts in the field and the ASCO Health Services Committee and was approved by the ASCO Board of Directors.",
        "Results/Findings": "The literature review identified one published prospective randomized controlled trial in which SNB was compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), four limited meta-analyses, and 69 published single-institution and multicenter trials in which the test performance of SNB was evaluated with respect to the results of ALND (completion axillary dissection). There are currently no data on the effect of SLN biopsy on long-term survival of patients with breast cancer. However, a review of the available evidence demonstrates that, when performed by experienced clinicians, SNB appears to be a safe and acceptably accurate method for identifying early-stage breast cancer without involvement of the axillary lymph nodes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SNB is an appropriate initial alternative to routine staging ALND for patients with early-stage breast cancer with clinically negative axillary nodes. Completion ALND remains standard treatment for patients with axillary metastases identified on SNB. Appropriately identified patients with negative results of SNB, when done under the direction of an experienced surgeon, need not have completion ALND. Isolated cancer cells detected by pathologic examination of the SLN with use of specialized techniques are currently of unknown clinical significance. Although such specialized techniques are often used, they are not a required part of SLN evaluation for breast cancer at this time. Data suggest that SNB is associated with less morbidity than ALND, but the comparative effects of these two approaches on tumor recurrence or patient survival are unknown.",

At 10 years, 98% of patients receiving TamRT (95% CI, 96% to 99%) compared with 90% of those receiving Tam (95% CI, 85% to 93%) were free from local and regional recurrences. There were no significant differences in time to mastectomy, time to distant metastasis, breast cancer-specific survival, or OS between the two groups. Ten-year OS was 67% (95% CI, 62% to 72%) and 66% (95% CI, 61% to 71%) in the TamRT and Tam groups, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With long-term follow-up, the previously observed small improvement in locoregional recurrence with the addition of radiation therapy remains. However, this does not translate into an advantage in OS, distant disease-free survival, or breast preservation. Depending on the value placed on local recurrence, Tam remains a reasonable option for women age ≥ 70 years with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We used data from EORTC 22881-10882 trial, with median follow-up of 77.4 months. Patients receiving BCT and 50Gy whole breast irradiation were randomized to no boost and 16Gy boost (N=5318).",
        "Results/Findings": "In univariate analysis, a boost reduced local failure by a factor of 2 (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed local control increased with age (P=0.0003). There was no evidence that the relative effect of a boost on local control depends on age (P=0.97) However in younger patients the 5-year local failure was higher, therefore the absolute reduction was greater. If the threshold-age for boost treatment were set at 40 years, 8.4% of the study population would receive a boost, resulting in a 5-year local failure of 6.1% in the study population. Changing the threshold-age to 60 years, 67% of the study population would receive a boost and the 5-year local failure would be reduced to 4.4%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In younger patients a boost dose resulted in a greater absolute reduction of local failure. The relative risk reduction was however similar for all ages. Applying a treatment policy with a threshold-age of 60 would result in 0.6% increase in local failure in the total study population, while sparing the boost to 1/3 of the patients.",

        "Results/Findings": "Of the 154 patients, 93 met the inclusion criteria (mean age, 35.2 ± 4.4 years). Thirty-five of the 93 patients were referred before breast surgery (PreS), and 58 patients were referred after surgery (PostS). The time periods from initial diagnosis (ID) to initiation of OS (42.6 ± 27.7 days for PreS v 71.9 ± 30.7 days for PostS; P < .001) and from ID to initiation of chemotherapy (83.9 ± 24.3 days for PreS v 107.8 ± 42.9 days for PostS; P = .045) were significantly shorter for the PreS group versus the PostS group. Nine (25.7%) of 35 patients in the PreS group versus one (1.7%) of 58 patients in the PostS group were able to undergo two FP cycles (P < .001), resulting in an increased yield of oocytes in the PreS group (18.2% [93 of 511 oocytes] v 0.6% [five of 800 oocytes], respectively; P < .001) and embryos (17.2% [40 of 233 embryos] v 0.6% [two of 357 embryos], respectively; P < .001). Patients who had an oocyte retrieval within 5 weeks of the surgery were able to complete a second cycle within 9 weeks of the surgery.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FP referral before breast surgery enables earlier initiation of cryopreservation cycles and chemotherapy and, when appropriate, multiple FP cycles. Women who can undergo multiple cycles may be at advantage for FP because of a larger number of oocytes or embryos cryopreserved. This is the first study demonstrating the benefit of early FP referral in patients with cancer.",

        "Methods": "This study is a post-trial follow-up of the ASTRRA trial, involving 1,483 premenopausal women younger than 45 years treated with definitive surgery after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to complete 5 years of tamoxifen (TAM) alone (TAM-only) or 5 years of TAM with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for 2 years (TAM + OFS). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary end point was overall survival (OS).",
        "Results/Findings": "At 106.4 months of median follow-up, there was a continuous significant reduction in the DFS event rate in the TAM + OFS group. The 8-year DFS rate was 85.4% in the TAM + OFS group and 80.2% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87). There were no significant differences in OS between the two groups. The OS rate was 96.5% in the TAM + OFS group and 95.3% in the TAM-only group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.25).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adding OFS for 2 years to adjuvant TAM with a longer follow-up resulted in consistent DFS benefits, suggesting that adding OFS to TAM should be considered for patients who remain in a premenopausal state or resume ovarian function after chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "Of the patients entered in the protocol, 55 were evaluable. Treatment consisted of: neoadjuvant MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) until a maximum response had been achieved; modified radical mastectomy; 6 courses of postoperative adjuvant MVAC chemotherapy, and chest wall irradiation (CWXRT). Multivariate analysis of locoregional response and overall survival was done.",

Chest wall doses ranged from 45 Gy to 50.4 Gy to the whole chest wall, with 31 patients receiving an additional chest-wall boost. The incidence of locoregional relapse with and without radiation was 7% vs. 31%, respectively (p = 0.026). An overall survival benefit was seen in those receiving radiation, with a mean overall survival of 50 months vs. 20 months, and a 3-year overall survival of 88% vs. 46% with and without radiation, respectively (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that overall survival was affected by the presence of pathological CR (p = .047), the number of pre-operative chemotherapy cycles (p = .036) and whether or not they received radiation (p = 0.003). Neither the interval between surgery and radiation, technique of radiation, nor radiation modality significantly affected local control.",

Median time from biopsy-confirmed diagnosis to treatment initiation was 22 days. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression showed that although Dx2Tx length did not affect survival among those diagnosed at early stage, among late-stage patients, intervals between diagnosis and first treatment ≥ 60 days were associated with significantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.77; P = .05) and breast cancer-specific survival (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.27; P = .04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "One in 10 women waited ≥ 60 days to initiate treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Waiting ≥ 60 days to initiate treatment was associated with a significant 66% and 85% increased risk of overall and breast cancer-related death, respectively, among late-stage patients. Interventions designed to increase the timeliness of receiving breast cancer treatments should target late-stage patients, and clinicians should strive to promptly triage and initiate treatment for patients diagnosed at late stage.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "One hundred patients with ABC received paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2) (group 1, n = 20) and carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2. Paclitaxel was subsequently reduced to 100 mg/m(2) (group 2, n = 80) because of toxicity. The median age was 58.5 years, and most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of <or= 2. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status were evenly distributed among both groups. Sixty-one patients received prior chemotherapy, 37 (61%) of whom received prior doxorubicin. Among 47 patients who received prior hormonal therapy, 43 received tamoxifen.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall response rate (ORR) among 95 assessable patients was 62%, including 8% complete responses and 54% partial responses. The median time to response was 1.8 months, and the median duration of response was 13.3 months. The median time to progression was 4.8 months. The median survival was 16 months. Neutropenia and leukopenia were the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities. In group 1, neutropenia (50%) and leukopenia (35%) necessitated dose reductions for 50% of patients during the first three cycles, prompting the reduction in paclitaxel dose to 100 mg/m(2). Grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities for all patients included peripheral neuropathy (11%), infection (6%), anemia (5%), weakness (6%), and paresthesia (3%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The 62% ORR achieved with weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin is among the highest achieved with chemotherapy for ABC. This high response rate and the lack of cardiotoxicity suggest that the regimen should be considered as a nonanthracycline regimen for future adjuvant therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In this prospective multicenter study, 360 women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer underwent FDG-PET. Images were blindly interpreted by three experienced readers for abnormally increased axillary FDG uptake. Imaging results from 308 assessable axillae were compared with axillary node pathology.",
        "Results/Findings": "For detecting axillary nodal metastasis, the mean estimated area under the receiver operator curve for the three readers was 0.74 (range, 0.70 to 0.76). If at least one probably or definitely abnormal axillary focus was considered positive, the mean (and range) sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PET were 61% (54% to 67%), 80% (79% to 81%), 62% (60% to 64%), and 79% (76% to 81%), respectively. False-negative axillae on PET had significantly smaller and fewer tumor-positive lymph nodes (2.7) than true-positive axillae (5.1; P <.005). Semiquantitative analysis of axillary FDG uptake showed that a nodal standardized uptake value (lean body mass) more than 1.8 had a positive predictive value of 90%, but a sensitivity of only 32%. Finding two or more intense foci of tracer uptake in the axilla was highly predictive of axillary metastasis (78% to 83% positive predictive value), albeit insensitive (27%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "FDG-PET has moderate accuracy for detecting axillary metastasis but often fails to detect axillae with small and few nodal metastases. Although highly predictive for nodal tumor involvement when multiple intense foci of tracer uptake are identified, FDG-PET is not routinely recommended for axillary staging of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.",

Weekly paclitaxel improved DFS and OS (HR, 0.69; P = .010 and HR, 0.69; P = .019, respectively) in triple-negative breast cancer. For hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-nonoverexpressing disease, no experimental arm improved OS, and black race and obesity were associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and death.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Improved outcomes initially observed for weekly paclitaxel were qualitatively similar but quantitatively less pronounced with longer follow-up, although exploratory analysis suggested substantial benefit in triple-negative disease.

Curative intent was defined as delivery of more than four cycles of anthracycline-based CT plus locoregional RT in patients without distant metastases.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up among survivors was 6.5 years. Median BCSS was 1.0 and 3.2 years for patients with distant metastases at diagnosis or those who were curatively treated, respectively. Among patients treated curatively (n = 308), there were no significant differences in LRFS or BCSS with timing of Mx before or after CT/RT, time between diagnosis and RT, or the sequence of RT and CT. Patients receiving more intensive CT had improved 10-year BCSS compared with standard CT (43.7% v 26.3%; P = .04). Ten-year LRFS for patients having Mx after CT, Mx before CT, and without Mx was 62.8%, 58.6%, and 34.4%, respectively (P = .0001); the corresponding 10-year BCSS was 36.9%, 19.9%, and 22.5%, respectively (P = .005). On multivariate analysis, Mx was associated with improved LRFS (P = .04). Independent prognostic factors for BCSS were menopausal status (P = .02), estrogen receptor status (P = .02), and CT type (P = .05).",

The median follow-up time was 3.3 years as of September 1994. The occurrence of telangiectasia was reported, and the patients were asked to evaluate the cosmetic result.",
        "Results/Findings": "At 5 years, 10 patients of 521 who had received the boost (Kaplan-Meier estimate of local relapse rate, 3.6%) and 20 of 503 who had received no further treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimate of local relapse rate, 4.5%) had developed a local recurrence (P = .044). After adjustment for the main prognostic variables, the relative risk was still significantly lower for the boost group (0.3; range, 0.12 to 0.95). The boost group had a higher rate of grade 1 and 2 telangiectasia (12.4% v 5.9%), but no difference was seen between the two treatment arms in the self-assessment score for the cosmetic result.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Delivery of a boost of 10 Gy to the tumor bed after 50 Gy to the whole breast following limited surgery significantly reduces the risk of early local recurrence, with no serious deterioration in the cosmetic result.

        "Results/Findings": "Cohort 1 comprised 9,856 patients with a mean of 5.8 years of follow-up. At 5 years, AI therapy was associated with an absolute 2.9% (SE = 0.7%) decrease in recurrence (9.6% for AI v 12.6% for tamoxifen; 2P < .00001) and a nonsignificant absolute 1.1% (SE = 0.5%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (4.8% for AI v 5.9% for tamoxifen; 2P = .1). Cohort 2 comprised 9,015 patients with a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up. At 3 years from treatment divergence (ie, approximately 5 years after starting hormonal treatment), AI therapy was associated with an absolute 3.1% (SE = 0.6%) decrease in recurrence (5.0% for AI v 8.1% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P < .00001) and an absolute 0.7% (SE = 0.3%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (1.7% for AI v 2.4% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P = .02). There was no convincing heterogeneity in the proportional recurrence reduction with respect to age, nodal status, tumor grade, or progesterone receptor status and no indication of an increase in nonbreast deaths with AIs in either cohort. CONCLUSION AIs produce significantly lower recurrence rates compared with tamoxifen, either as initial monotherapy or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.

The primary end points were time to progression (TTP), objective response (OR), and tolerability.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 668 patients (340 in the anastrozole arm and 328 in the tamoxifen arm) were randomized to treatment and followed-up for a median of 19 months. Median TTP was similar for both treatments (8.2 months in patients who received anastrozole and 8.3 months in patients who received tamoxifen). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 0.99 (lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 0.86), demonstrating that anastrozole was at least equivalent to tamoxifen. Anastrozole was also as effective as tamoxifen in terms of OR (32.9% of anastrozole and 32.6% of tamoxifen patients achieved a complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Clinical benefit (CR + PR + stabilization of > or = 24 weeks) rates were 56.2% and 55.5% for patients receiving anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated.

        "Methods": "Two randomized, double-blind for anastrozole, open-label for megestrol acetate, parallel-group, multicenter trials were conducted in 764 patients. Because both trials were identical in design, an analysis of the combined results was performed to strengthen interpretation of results from each trial.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up duration was approximately 6 months. The estimated progression hazards ratios were 0.97 (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.24) for anastrozole 1 mg versus megestrol acetate and 0.92 (97.5% CI, 0.71 to 1.19) for anastrozole 10 mg versus megestrol acetate. The overall median time to progression was approximately 21 weeks. Approximately one third of patients in each group benefited from treatment. Twenty-seven patients (10.3%) in the anastrozole 1-mg group, 22 (8.9%) in the anastrozole 10-mg group, and 20 (7.9%) in the megestrol acetate group had a complete or partial response, and 66 (25.1%), 56 (22.6%), and 66 (26.1%) patients, respectively, had stable disease for > or = 24 weeks. For all end points, individual trial results were similar to the results of the combined analysis. Anastrozole and megestrol acetate were well tolerated. Gastrointestinal disturbance was more common among patients in the anastrozole groups than the megestrol acetate group; the difference between the anastrozole 10 mg and megestrol acetate groups was significant (P = .005). Significantly fewer patients in the anastrozole 1-mg (P < .0001) and 10-mg (P < .002) groups had weight gain than in the megestrol acetate group. More than 30% of megestrol acetate-treated patients had weight gain > or = 5%, and 10% of patients had weight gain > or = 10%. Patients who received megestrol acetate continued to gain weight over time.",

A matched cohort was selected by using variables of hormone receptor status, age, and year of surgery. We estimated rates of local and distant recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in the two groups.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 150 consecutive patients with pT1a-b, pN0, HER2-positive tumors. No patient received adjuvant trastuzumab. The median follow-up was 4.6 years (range, 1.0 to 9.0 years). In the hormone receptor-positive group, 5-year DFS rates were 99% (95% CI, 96% to 100%) for HER2-negative disease and 92% (95% CI, 86% to 99%) for HER2-positive disease. In the hormone receptor-negative group, 5-year DFS rates were 92% (95% CI, 84% to 100%) for HER2-negative disease and 91% (95% CI, 84% to 99%) for HER2-positive disease. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) associated with HER2 overexpression was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.9 to 6.5; P = .09). After analysis was adjusted for pT1 stage, hormone receptor-positive disease with HER2-positive status was associated with a worse prognosis (HR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 25.7).

Analyzable data included age, race, registry, grade, stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, type of surgery, and use of RT. Stage was defined as localized (LocD): confined to the breast; regional (RegD): involving skin, chest wall, and/or regional lymph nodes; and distant: M1. The primary endpoint was cause-specific survival (CSS).",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 4276 cases of MBC and 718,587 cases of FBC were identified. Male breast cancer constituted 0.6% of all breast cancer. Comparing MBC with FBC, mastectomy (M) was used in 87.4% versus 38.3%, and breast-conserving surgery in 12.6% versus 52.6% (P<10(-4)). For males with LocD, CSS was not significantly different for the 4.6% treated with lumpectomy/RT versus the 70% treated with M alone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-3.61; P=.57). Postmastectomy RT was delivered in 33% of males with RegD and was not associated with an improvement in CSS (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.88-1.41; P=.37). There was a significant increase in the use of postmastectomy RT in MBC over time: 24.3%, 27.2%, and 36.8% for 1973-1987, 1988-1997, and 1998-2008, respectively (P<.0001). Cause-specific survival for MBC has improved: the largest significant change was identified for men diagnosed in 1998-2008 compared with 1973-1987 (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; P=.0004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Surgical management of MBC is dramatically different than for FBC. The majority of males with LocD receive M despite equivalent CSS with lumpectomy/RT. Postmastectomy RT is greatly underutilized in MBC with RegD, although a CSS benefit was not demonstrated. Outcomes for MBC are improving, attributable to improved therapy and its use in this unscreened population.",

        "Methods": "In EORTC trial 22881/10882, 5569 early-stage breast cancer patients were treated with tumorectomy and axillary dissection, followed by tangential fields irradiation of the breast to a dose of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, at 2 Gy per fraction. A total of 5318 patients, having a microscopically complete tumorectomy, were randomized between no further treatment and a boost of 16 Gy to the primary tumor bed. The cosmetic result at 3-year follow-up was assessed by a panel for 731 patients, and by digitizer measurements, measuring the displacement of the nipple, for 1141 patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the correlation between various patient, tumor, and treatment factors and cosmesis.",
        "Results/Findings": "The factors associated with a worsened cosmesis according to the panel evaluation were: an inferior tumor location, a large excision volume, the presence of postoperative breast complications, and the radiotherapy boost. According to the digitizer measurements, a central/superior tumor location, a large excision volume, an increased pathological tumor size, an increased radiation dose inhomogeneity, and an increased bra cup size resulted in an increased asymmetry in nipple position. It appeared that the evaluation of the nipple position (whether by panel or by digitizer) is only moderately representative of the overall cosmetic outcome.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "To achieve a good cosmesis, it is necessary to excise the tumor with a limited margin, to avoid postoperative complications, to assess the need for a boost in the individual patient, and to give the radiation dose as homogeneously as possible. As far as the method of evaluation is concerned, the panel evaluation is the most appropriate method for giving an overall impression of the cosmetic result after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). The use of the digitizer is recommended for comparing the cosmetic outcome of two different approaches to BCT or for analyzing cosmetic changes over time.",

        "Results/Findings": "We included 1187 MBC and 166,054 FBC. Median follow-up was 21 months (range, 1 to 48) for both groups. OS at 3 years for MBC and FBC was 85.6% and 90.4%, respectively (P=0.0002). MBC were more ductal, had higher grade, presented with more advanced stage and were often HR+/HER2- (each P<0.0001). MBC had worse OS than FBC in HR+/HER2- (Hazard ratio [HaR], 1.5; P=0.0005), HR+/HER2+ (HaR, 2.8; P<0.0001) and triple negative (HaR, 4.3; P<0.0001) (Pinteraction<0.02). MBC had significantly worse OS than FBC in stages I and II, but similar OS in stages III and IV (Pinteraction<0.01). In multivariate analysis, HR+/HER2+ was the only subtype with significant differences in OS between MBC and FBC (HaR, 2.0; P=0.002).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "OS was significantly different in both groups. Men had worse OS in early stages while similar OS in stages III and IV. There were significant differences in OS according to tumor subtype; compared with women, men with HR+/HER2+ tumors had twice the risk of death.",

Tamoxifen was given to 94% of patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no evidence of a doxorubicin dose effect. At 5 years, disease-free survival was 69%, 66%, and 67% for patients randomly assigned to 60, 75, and 90 mg/m(2), respectively. The hazard reductions from adding paclitaxel to CA were 17% for recurrence (adjusted Wald chi(2) P =.0023; unadjusted Wilcoxon P =.0011) and 18% for death (adjusted P =.0064; unadjusted P =.0098). At 5 years, the disease-free survival (+/- SE) was 65% (+/- 1) and 70% (+/- 1), and overall survival was 77% (+/- 1) and 80% (+/- 1) after CA alone or CA plus paclitaxel, respectively. The effects of adding paclitaxel were not significantly different in subsets defined by the protocol, but in an unplanned subset analysis, the hazard ratio of CA plus paclitaxel versus CA alone was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.86) for those with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and only 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.07) for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, almost all of whom received adjuvant tamoxifen. The additional toxicity from adding four cycles of paclitaxel was generally modest.",

They were stratified into five groups according to the main assessable tumor target: lung, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and others. One hundred forty-five patients were assessable for toxicity and response using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria; the 12 patients who were not evaluated were excluded because they were found not to meet the eligibility criteria. Navelbine was administered as a weekly 30-mg/m2 short IV infusion, and treatment was continued until disease progression.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall response rate (WHO criteria) was 41% (complete response [CR], 7%; partial response [PR], 34%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 33% to 49%). In addition, 30% of the patients had stable disease. The response rate according to target was lymph nodes (28 of 42), 67%; liver (nine of 39), 23%; lung (10 of 30), 33%; skin (21 of 30), 70%; primary tumor (10 of 16), 56%; and bone (three of 10), 30%. The median time to treatment failure was 6 months and the median survival was 18 months. A total of 1,673 cycles were given to 145 eligible patients. At least one episode of WHO grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 72% of the patients. Nausea and/or vomiting, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia were seen in less than 1% of cycles.

Whole-body PET images were scored from 1 (definitely negative) to 5 (definitely positive) by three independent observers, and discrepancies were resolved by a fourth observer. Patients were clinically followed for up to 24 mo to assess the accuracy of PET diagnosis by biopsy, follow-up imaging and other diagnostic tests.",
        "Results/Findings": "PET scans showed that there were 41 sites indicating recurrent or metastatic disease in 29 patients. There were 38 sites in 28 patients that showed no evidence for malignant disease. On a patient basis, with scores 4 or 5 considered to be positive, sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 79%, respectively. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 82% and 92%. On a lesion basis, with scores 4 or 5 considered to be positive, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity 79%. The area index in receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.91 for patient-based analysis and 0.88 for lesion-based analysis. To determine the cause for false-negative and false-positive findings more precisely, false-negative lesions with scores of 3 or lower and false-positive lesions with scores of 4 or higher were analyzed. Bone metastases had a significantly larger proportion of false-negative lesions than other nonosseous malignant sites (p < 0.05). False-positive lesions were due to muscle uptake (n = 5), inflammation (n = 4), blood pool activity in the great vessels (n = 2), bowel uptake (n = 1) and unknown causes (n = 6).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The whole-body FDG-PET scan is a useful diagnostic test for detecting recurrent or metastatic lesions of breast carcinoma. However, the sensitivity for metastases to bone appears to be lower than that to other organs. Specificity may be improved by more strict attention to patient preparation and better recognition of physiologic skeletal muscle or artifactual uptakes.",

Cases of malignant neoplasms associated with obstetrical delivery were attributed to 1 of 3 categories, depending on the earliest documented hospital discharge diagnosis, as follows: \"prenatal\" if the diagnosis was first documented by hospitalization within 9 months preceding delivery, \"at delivery\" if the diagnosis was established from the delivery hospitalization, or \"postpartum\" if the diagnosis was first documented by hospitalization within 12 months after delivery.",
        "Results/Findings": "Computer-linked infant birth and death certificates and maternal and neonatal discharge records were used to identify cases and outcomes. Cases of malignant neoplasms were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (140-208). Noninvasive neoplasms and carcinoma in situ neoplasms were excluded. In analysis of outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel estimate for adjusted odds ratios was used.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among 3,168,911 obstetrical deliveries over the 6-year span, a total of 2247 cases of primary malignancy were identified. The observed rate of occurrence for primary malignant neoplasms was 0.71 per 1000 live singleton births. Most cases (53.3%) were first documented in the postpartum period as follows: prenatal, 587 cases (0.18 per 1000); at delivery, 462 cases (0.15 per 1000); and postpartum, 1198 cases (0.38 per 1000). The most frequently documented primary malignant neoplasms associated with obstetrical delivery were breast cancer (423 cases, 0.13 per 1000), thyroid cancer (389 cases, 0.12 per 1000), cervical cancer (266 cases, 0.08 per 1000), Hodgkin's disease (172 cases, 0.05 per 1000), and ovarian cancer (123 cases, 0.04 per 1000). Odds ratios for a variety of demographic factors identified maternal age as the most significant risk factor for development of malignant neoplasms (age greater than 40 vs 20-25, odds ratio 5.7, CI 4.6-6.9). Age-adjusted odds ratios for maternal cancer of any type suggested significantly elevated risks for cesarean delivery (odds ratio 1.4, CI 1.3-1.6), blood transfusion (odds ratio 6.2, CI 4.5-8.5), hysterectomy (odds ratio 27.4, CI 20.8-36.1), and maternal postpartum hospital stay greater than 5 days (odds ratio 30.6, CI 27.9-33.6), but not for postpartum maternal death (odds ratio 0.8, CI 0.6-1.0). Odds ratios also suggested significantly elevated risks for premature newborn (odds ratio 2.0, CI 1.8-2.2), very low birth weight (odds ratio 2.9, CI 2.2-3.8), and newborn hospital stay longer than 5 days (odds ratio 2.6, CI 2.4-3.0), but not for neonatal death (odds ratio 1.6, CI 0.8-3.1) or infant death (odds ratio 1.2, CI 0.5-3.3). However, several types of malignant neoplasms did confer significant elevations in risk for neonatal death. Hospital charges for both maternal and neonatal care were significantly elevated in the maternal malignant neoplasm group.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This combined analysis of two trials of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast carcinoma has clearly demonstrated that, after disease progression with tamoxifen, treatment with anastrozole 1 mg once daily results in a statistically and clinically significant advantage over a standard treatment, megestrol acetate. This important benefit, in addition to the good tolerability profile of anastrozole, supports the use of this drug as a valuable new treatment option for this patient population.",

        "Methods": "In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS. Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten). All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours. All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals. This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed). Median follow-up was 7·2 years (IQR 5·6-8·9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded. We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·64-1·23]). The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1·25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0·49). A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·58-1·50], p=0·78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other. The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments. Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen. Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.",

Patients with negative margins were significantly less likely to experience recurrence than patients with positive margins after RT (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.47). A negative margin significantly reduced the risk of IBTR when compared with a close (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83) or unknown margin (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.87). When specific margin thresholds were examined, a 2-mm margin was superior to a margin less than 2 mm (OR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.96); however, we saw no significant difference in the rate of IBTR with margins between 2 mm and more than 5 mm (OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 0.51 to 5.0; P > .05).",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients were age >or= 18 years and had received a prior anthracycline-based regimen as adjuvant treatment. Ixabepilone as first-line metastatic chemotherapy was administered as a 40 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion during 3 hours every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary efficacy end points included duration of response, time to response, time to progression, and survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "All 65 patients were assessable for response. Their median age was 52 years (range, 33 to 80 years). ORR was 41.5% (95% CI, 29.4% to 54.4%), median duration of response was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 10.2 months), and median time to response was 6 weeks (range, 5 to 17 weeks). Median survival was 22.0 months (95% CI, 15.6 to 27.0 months). Treatment-related adverse events were manageable and mostly grades 1/2: the most common of these (other than alopecia) was mild to moderate neuropathy, which was primarily sensory and mostly reversible in nature.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Ixabepilone is efficacious and has a predictable and manageable safety profile in women with MBC previously treated with an adjuvant anthracycline.",

        "es_title": "Tamoxifen for early breast cancer: an overview of the randomized trials.",
        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen before recurrence. Information was obtained and analysed centrally on each of 37000 women in 55 such trials, comprising about 87% of the worldwide evidence. Compared with the previous such overview, this approximately doubles the amount of evidence from trials of about 5 years of tamoxifen and, taking all trials together, on events occurring more than 5 years after randomisation.",
        "Results/Findings": "Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (SD 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (chi2(1)=52.0, 2p<0.00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (chi2(1) = 8.8, 2p=0.003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10.9% (SD 2.5) for node-positive (61.4% vs 50.5% survival, 2p<0.00001) and 5.6% (SD 1.3) for node-negative (78.9% vs 73.3% survival, 2p<0.00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied (ie, including those with \"ER-poor\" tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13% (SD 13), 26% (SD 9), and 47% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0.99 [SD 0.05]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments.",

        "es_title": "Polychemotherapy for early breast cancer: an overview of therandomised trials",
        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 and involved treatment groups that differed only with respect to the chemotherapy regimens that were being compared. Analyses involved about 18,000 women in 47 trials of prolonged polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy, about 6000 in 11 trials of longer versus shorter polychemotherapy, and about 6000 in 11 trials of anthracycline-containing regimens versus CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil).",
        "Results/Findings": "For recurrence, polychemotherapy produced substantial and highly significant proportional reductions both among women aged under 50 at randomisation (35% [SD 4] reduction; 2p<0.00001) and among those aged 50-69 (20% [SD 3] reduction; 2p<0.00001); few women aged 70 or over had been studied. For mortality, the reductions were also significant both among women aged under 50 (27% [SD 5] reduction; 2p<0.00001) and among those aged 50-69 (11% [SD 3] reduction; 2p=0.0001). The recurrence reductions emerged chiefly during the first 5 years of follow-up, whereas the difference in survival grew throughout the first 10 years. After standardisation for age and time since randomisation, the proportional reductions in risk were similar for women with node-negative and node-positive disease. Applying the proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged under 50 at randomisation would typically change a 10-year survival of 71% for those with node-negative disease to 78% (an absolute benefit of 7%), and of 42% for those with node-positive disease to 53% (an absolute benefit of 11%). The smaller proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged 50-69 at randomisation would translate into smaller absolute benefits, changing a 10-year survival of 67% for those with node-negative disease to 69% (an absolute gain of 2%) and of 46% for those with node-positive disease to 49% (an absolute gain of 3%). The age-specific benefits of polychemotherapy appeared to be largely irrespective of menopausal status at presentation, oestrogen receptor status of the primary tumour, and of whether adjuvant tamoxifen had been given. In terms of other outcomes, there was a reduction of about one-fifth (2p=0.05) in contralateral breast cancer, which has already been included in the analyses of recurrence, and no apparent adverse effect on deaths from causes other than breast cancer (death rate ratio 0.89 [SD 0.09]). The directly randomised comparisons of longer versus shorter durations of polychemotherapy did not indicate any survival advantage with the use of more than about 3-6 months of polychemotherapy. By contrast, directly randomised comparisons did suggest that, compared with CMF alone, the anthracycline-containing regimens studied produced somewhat greater effects on recurrence (2p=0.006) and mortality (69% vs 72% 5-year survival; log-rank 2p=0.02). But this comparison is one of many that could have been selected for emphasis, the 99% CI reaches zero, and the results of several of the relevant trials are not yet available.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Some months of adjuvant polychemotherapy (eg, with CMF or an anthracycline-containing regimen) typically produces an absolute improvement of about 7-11% in 10-year survival for women aged under 50 at presentation with early breast cancer, and of about 2-3% for those aged 50-69 (unless their prognosis is likely to be extremely good even without such treatment). Treatment decisions involve consideration not only of improvements in cancer recurrence and survival but also of adverse side-effects of treatment, and this report makes no recommendations as to who should or should not be treated.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Standard tangential plans of 1,145 trial patients were analyzed; 815 patients had inhomogeneous plans (≥ 2 cm(3) receiving 107% of prescribed dose: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) and were randomly assigned to standard radiotherapy (RT) or replanned with simple IMRT; 330 patients with satisfactory dose homogeneity were treated with standard RT and underwent the same follow-up as the randomly assigned patients. Breast tissue toxicities were assessed at 5 years using validated methods: photographic assessment (overall cosmesis and breast shrinkage compared with baseline pre-RT photographs) and clinical assessment (telangiectasia, induration, edema, and pigmentation). Comparisons between different groups were analyzed using polychotomous logistic regression.",
        "Results/Findings": "On univariate analysis, compared with standard RT, fewer patients in the simple IMRT group developed suboptimal overall cosmesis (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.96; P = .027) and skin telangiectasia (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.92; P = .021). No evidence of difference was seen for breast shrinkage, breast edema, tumor bed induration, or pigmentation. The benefit of IMRT was maintained on multivariate analysis for both overall cosmesis (P = .038) and skin telangiectasia (P = .031).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Improved dose homogeneity with simple IMRT translates into superior overall cosmesis and reduces the risk of skin telangiectasia. These results are practice changing and should encourage centers still using two-dimensional RT to implement simple breast IMRT.",

        "Methods": "In all, 102 patients with a history of breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to venlafaxine 75 mg, clonidine 0.1 mg, or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Questionnaires at baseline and during treatment assessed daily hot flash scores, sexual function, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression.",
        "Results/Findings": "After 12 weeks, a total of 80 patients were evaluable for the primary end point. During week 12, hot flash scores were significantly lower in the clonidine group versus placebo (P = .03); for venlafaxine versus placebo, the difference was borderline not significant (P = .07). However, hot flash scores were equal in the clonidine and venlafaxine groups. Over the course of 12 weeks, the differences between both treatments and placebo were significant (P <.001 for venlafaxine v placebo; P = .045 for clonidine v placebo). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse effects of nausea (P = .02), constipation (P = .04), and severe appetite loss were higher in the venlafaxine group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Venlafaxine and clonidine are effective treatments in the management of hot flashes in patients with breast cancer.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Our database consisted of 408 women with DCIS. Applying the USC/VNPI we reviewed retrospectively 259 patients who were treated with breast conserving surgery with or without radiotherapy (RT). Of these patients 63.5% had a low VNPI score, 32% intermediate and 4.5% a high score. In the low score group, the majority of the patients underwent Conservative Surgery (CS) without RT while in the intermediate group, almost half of the patients received RT. Eighty-three percent (83%) of the patients with high VNPI were treated with Conservative Surgery plus RT. Nodal assessment by Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy was obtained in 32 patients since 2002.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-one Local Recurrences were observed (8%) with a mean follow up of 130 months: sixteen were invasive. No statistically significant differences in Disease Free Survival were reached in all groups of VNPI score between patients treated with Conservative Surgery or Conservative Surgery plus RT. However it was noted that the higher the VNPI score, the lower was the risk of local recurrence in the group treated additionally with RT, even though it was not statistically significant. Further analysis included those patients treated with Conservative Surgery alone and followed up. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years was 94% with low VNPI and 83% in both intermediate and high score (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the subgroups of VNPI. The Local Relapse rate after Conservative Surgery alone, increased with tumor size, margin width, and pathology classification (P < 0,05), while age was not found to be a significant factor. Lesions with only mammographic appearances are associated with lower DFS but it did not reach significance (P = ns), while assumption of estrogenic hormones and familial history of breast cancer are significant factors associated with a higher risk of local recurrence. After multivariate analysis including seven clinical and pathological factors, the only significant predictors of local recurrence remained margin width of surgical excision, previous therapy with estrogens (contraceptives or Hormone Replacement Therapy) and the Van Nuys pathologic classification. The overall survival breast cancer specific was 99% and no differences were observed between groups (P = ns). The comparison of patients treated with a total mastectomy and those conservatively treated showed a significantly better local relapse free survival rate obtained with mastectomy (98.2% vs. 89.7% at 10 years P = 0.02). However, the overall cause-specific survival did not prove any better outcome (98.7% in both groups). Of the 32 patients who underwent a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy, four were found to have micrometastases and all of them had a previous Directional Vacuum Assisted Biopsy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although in our series there is not a significant difference in LR rates by the parameter of age, the new USC/VNPI is still a simple and reliable scoring system for therapeutic management of DCIS. We did not find any statistically significant advantage in groups treated with the addition of RT. Obtaining wide surgical margins appears to be the strongest prognostic factor for local recurrence, regardless of other pathological factors or the addition of adjuvant radiation therapy. However, only prospective randomized studies can precisely predict the risk of LR of conservatively treated DCIS. The clinical significance of Sentinel Lymph Nodes micrometastases Immuno-Histo-Chemistry-detected found in DCIS patients remains uncertain. However, we hypothesize that the anatomical disruption after preoperative biopsy procedures increases the likelihood of epithelial cell displacement and the frequency of IHC-positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes, both of which are directly proportional to the degree of manipulation.",

Sample size calculations (ratio of patients who received the boost dose to those who did not, 2:1; α = .05; power = 80%) estimated that 2982 cases were needed to detect a difference of at least 3%. The final analysis included 4131 patients (2661 in the boost group and 1470 in the no-boost group) with a median follow-up of 9 years and media boost dose of 14 Gy. Data were collected from July 2011 through February 2014 and analyzed from March 2014 through August 2015.",

        "Methods": "Evaluation of Faslodex versus Exemestane Clinical Trial (EFECT) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter phase III trial of fulvestrant versus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer (ABC) progressing or recurring after nonsteroidal AI. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). A fulvestrant loading-dose (LD) regimen was used: 500 mg intramuscularly on day 0, 250 mg on days 14, 28, and 250 mg every 28 days thereafter. Exemestane 25 mg orally was administered once daily.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 693 women were randomly assigned to fulvestrant (n = 351) or exemestane (n = 342). Approximately 60% of patients had received at least two prior endocrine therapies. Median TTP was 3.7 months in both groups (hazard ratio = 0.963; 95% CI, 0.819 to 1.133; P = .6531). The overall response rate (7.4% v 6.7%; P = .736) and clinical benefit rate (32.2% v 31.5%; P = .853) were similar between fulvestrant and exemestane respectively. Median duration of clinical benefit was 9.3 and 8.3 months, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events or quality of life. Pharmacokinetic data confirm that steady-state was reached within 1 month with the LD schedule of fulvestrant.",

HER2 results from cytological specimens of matched distant metastases were compared with the results from the corresponding primary tumours (n = 105 patients). In addition, lymph node metastases were analysed in 31 of these patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER2 amplification was found in 20% of distant metastases. HER2 status was discordant between the primary tumour and distant metastasis in 7.6% of the 105 patients. Re-evaluation revealed that in five patients (4.7%), discrepancies were due to interpretational difficulties. In two of these patients, focal amplification had initially been overlooked as a result of heterogeneity in the primary tumours or in the metastases, respectively. A further three patients had borderline amplification with a ratio close to 2. Discrepancy remained unexplained in three patients (2.9%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "HER2 gene status remains highly conserved as breast cancers metastasise.

Key words used were \"mastectomy,\" \"nipple involvement,\" \"nipple-sparing mastectomy,\" \"skin-sparing mastectomy,\" \"occult nipple malignancy,\" \"occult nipple disease,\" and \"breast cancer recurrence.\" Articles were analyzed regarding incidence of occult nipple malignancy, potential factors influencing the incidence of occult malignancy, and recurrence/complications following nipple-sparing mastectomy. The incidence of occult nipple disease was compared between groups using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall rate of occult nipple malignancy was 11.5 percent. Primary tumor characteristics influencing occult nipple malignancy were tumor-nipple distance less than 2 cm, grade, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-negative, tumor size greater than 5 cm, retroareolar/central location, and multicentric tumors. The overall nipple recurrence rate considered significant was 0.9 percent, and the skin flap recurrence rate was 4.2 percent. Full- and partial-thickness nipple necrosis rates were 2.9 and 6.3 percent, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Nipple-sparing mastectomy for primary breast cancer is appropriate in carefully selected patients. All patients should have retroareolar sampling. There is strong evidence to suggest that suitable cases are well circumscribed single or multifocal lesions that have a tumor-to-nipple distance greater than 2 cm.

        "Methods": "In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited previously untreated patients (≤65 years of age with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at least 1 year) presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast tumour and axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, by a computer-generated block randomisation sequence (block size of four). Randomisation was stratified by site of distant metastases, number of metastatic lesions, and hormone receptor status. Patients with resectable primary tumour in the breast that could be treated with endocrine therapy were randomly assigned upfront, whereas those with an unresectable primary tumour were planned for chemotherapy before randomisation. Of the patients who had chemotherapy before randomisation, we randomly assigned patients who had an objective tumour response after six to eight cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 7, 2005, and Jan 18, 2013, of the 716 women presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, we randomly assigned 350 patients: 173 to locoregional treatment and 177 to no locoregional treatment. At data cut-off of Nov 1, 2013, median follow-up was 23 months (IQR 12·2-38·7) with 235 deaths (locoregional treatment n=118, no locoregional treatment n=117). Median overall survival was 19·2 months (95% CI 15·98-22·46) in the locoregional treatment group and 20·5 months (16·96-23·98) in the no-locoregional treatment group (HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·81-1·34; p=0·79), and the corresponding 2-year overall survival was 41·9% (95% CI 33·9-49·7) in the locoregional treatment group and 43·0% (35·2-50·8) in the no locoregional treatment group. The only adverse event noted was wound infection related to surgery in one patient in the locoregional treatment group.",

        "Methods": "One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to olaparib or placebo following (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy if indicated. Endocrine therapy was given concurrently with study medication for hormone receptor-positive cancers. Statistical significance for OS at this IA required P < 0.015.",
        "Results/Findings": "With a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the second IA of OS demonstrated significant improvement in the olaparib group relative to the placebo group [hazard ratio 0.68; 98.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.97; P = 0.009]. Four-year OS was 89.8% in the olaparib group and 86.4% in the placebo group (Δ 3.4%, 95% CI -0.1% to 6.8%). Four-year IDFS for the olaparib group versus placebo group was 82.7% versus 75.4% (Δ 7.3%, 95% CI 3.0% to 11.5%) and 4-year DDFS was 86.5% versus 79.1% (Δ 7.4%, 95% CI 3.6% to 11.3%), respectively.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "This prospective randomized trial (1998 to 2006) in women with mammographically detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, measuring less than 2.5 cm with margins ≥ 3 mm, compared RT with observation after surgery. The study was designed for 1,790 patients but was closed early because of lower than projected accrual. Six hundred thirty-six patients from the United States and Canada were entered; tamoxifen use (62%) was optional. Ipsilateral local failure (LF) was the primary end point; LF and contralateral failure were estimated using cumulative incidence, and overall and disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up time was 7.17 years (range, 0.01 to 11.33 years). Two LFs occurred in the RT arm, and 19 occurred in the observation arm. At 7 years, the LF rate was 0.9% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.2%) in the RT arm versus 6.7% (95% CI, 3.2% to 9.6%) in the observation arm (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.47; P < .001). Grade 1 to 2 acute toxicities occurred in 30% and 76% of patients in the observation and RT arms, respectively; grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in 4.0% and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Late RT toxicity was grade 1 in 30%, grade 2 in 4.6%, and grade 3 in 0.7% of patients.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this good-risk subset of patients with DCIS, with a median follow-up of 7 years, the LF rate was low with observation but was decreased significantly with the addition of RT.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Pretreatment diagnostic CT chest scans available for 30 breast cancer patients with clinically involved lymph nodes were fused with simulation CT. Contouring of axillary levels I, II, and III according to the RTOG guidelines was performed. Measurements were made from the area of distal tumor to the anatomic borders in 6 dimensions for each level.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of the 30 patients, 100%, 93%, and 37% had clinical involvement of levels I, II, and III, respectively. The mean number of lymph nodes dissected was 13.6. The mean size of the largest lymph node was 2.4 cm. Extracapsular extension was seen in 23% of patients. In 97% of patients, an aspect of the involved lymph node lay outside of the anatomic border of a level. In 80% and 83% of patients, tumor extension was seen outside the cranial (1.78 ± 1.0 cm; range, 0.28-3.58 cm) and anterior (1.27 ± 0.92 cm; range, 0.24-3.58 cm) borders of level I, respectively. In 80% of patients, tumor extension was seen outside the caudal border of level II (1.36 ± 1.0 cm, range, 0.27-3.86 cm), and 0% to 33% of patients had tumor extension outside the remaining borders of all levels.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "To cover 95% of lymph nodes at the cranial and anterior borders of level I, an additional clinical target volume margin of 3.78 cm and 3.11 cm, respectively, is necessary. The RTOG guidelines may be insufficient for coverage of axillary disease in patients with clinical nodal involvement who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, incomplete axillary dissection, or treatment with intensity modulated radiation therapy. In patients with pretreatment diagnostic CT chest scans, fusion with simulation CT should be considered for tumor delineation.",

        "Methods": "The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients treated during the period 1980-1994 for Paget's disease of the breast who did not present with a palpable mass or mammographic density. Through a collaborative review, 30 cases were identified. A biopsy confirming the presence of typical Paget's cells was performed on all patients. All patients received external beam radiotherapy to the breast, with a median dose of 50 gray (Gy). Ninety-seven percent received a boost to the remaining nipple or tumor bed, with a median dose to the tumor bed of 61.5 Gy.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up for surviving patients was 62 months. Three patients (10%) developed a recurrence in the breast as the only site of first failure, and 2 additional patients (7%) experienced failure in the breast as a component of first failure. The median time to local failure was 69 months. The 5- and 8-year actuarial estimates of local failure as the only site of first failure were 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-20%) and 16% (95% CI, 0-31%), respectively. Of the 5 patients with local failures, 3 were among 22 patients (14%) who underwent complete resection of the nipple or nipple-areola complex, compared with 2 failures among 6 patients (33%) after partial resection (P = 0.29). There were no failures among 2 patients who had a biopsy only. Four of 5 local failures were salvaged by mastectomy, and 3 of these patients were free of disease after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5- and 8-year estimates of disease free survival for the overall series were both 95% (95% CI, 87-100%); cause specific overall survival was 100% at 8 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast-conserving therapy involving complete resection of the nipple-areola complex followed by definitive radiotherapy is a viable alternative to mastectomy in the treatment of Paget's disease. High rates of disease free and cause specific survival, in addition to adequate local control, justify consideration of a conservative approach.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Data from 1,021 nonpregnant women with early-stage breast cancer who underwent SLN mapping and biopsy procedures were analyzed. Patients had a single-site intradermal injection of unfiltered TSC in 0.05 mL normal saline: 3.7 MBq (0.1 mCi) on the morning of surgery (1-d protocol) or 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) on the afternoon before surgery (2-d protocol). A standard internal dose calculation methodology was used to calculate absorbed doses to various organs and to a modeled fetus at 3-, 6-, and 9-mo gestation from the injection site as well as from systemic activity.",
        "Results/Findings": "The highest estimated absorbed doses were observed for the reference 9-mo-pregnant model under the 2-d protocol. Absorbed doses of 14.9, 0.214, 0.062, 0.151, 0.004, 0.163, 0.075, and 0.014 mGy were received by the injected breast, heart, liver, lung, ovaries, thymus, total body, and fetus, respectively. Effective doses from the 2-d protocol were estimated to be 0.460, 0.186, and 0.245 mSv for the reference population, the total Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) study patient population, and childbearing-age MSKCC patient population (i.e., <45 y old), respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SLN procedures lead to a negligible dose to the fetus of 0.014 mGy or less. This is much less than the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements limit to a pregnant woman. Calculations using actual patient population characteristics resulted in lower organ dose estimates than more conservative reference models.",

        "Methods": "We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Trials were located through PubMed, ISI, Cochrane Library, and major cancer scientific meeting searches. All trials that randomized patients with primary breast cancer to undergo adjuvant treatment with zoledronic acid versus nonuse, placebo, or delayed use of zoledronic acid as treatment to individuals who develop osteoporosis were considered eligible. Standard meta-analytic procedures were used to analyze the study outcomes.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fifteen studies were considered eligible and were further analyzed. The use of zoledronic acid resulted in a statistically significant better overall survival outcome (five studies, 6,414 patients; hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.94). No significant differences were found for the disease-free survival outcome (seven studies, 7,541 patients; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-1.06) or incidence of bone metastases (seven studies, 7,543 patients; odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.64-1.37). Treatment with zoledronic acid led to a significantly lower overall fracture rate (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96). Finally, the rate of osteonecrosis of the jaw was 0.52%.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Zoledronic acid as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients appears to not only reduce the fracture risk but also offer a survival benefit over placebo or no treatment.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Between 1987 and 1998, 61 eligible patients were registered in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Study 10873. The majority of patients (97%) presented without an associated palpable mass. At histologic examination, the majority (93%%) of patients had an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); in the remaining 7%, only Paget disease was found. Treatment was comprised of a complete excision of the nipple-areolar complex including the underlying breast tissue with tumor free margins, followed by external irradiation to the whole breast (50 gray in 25 fractions). The primary endpoint was local recurrence.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 4 of the 61 patients developed a recurrence in the treated breast (1 patient with DCIS and 3 patients with invasive disease). One patient with an invasive local recurrence died of disseminated breast carcinoma. The 5-year local recurrence rate was 5.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.8-14.1%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast-conserving therapy is a feasible alternative for patients with Paget disease and a limited extent of underlying DCIS. To achieve good local control, treatment should be comprised of a complete excision of the nipple-areolar complex including the underlying disease, followed by irradiation to the whole breast.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "A central tumour bank was prospectively established within PlanB. Following an early amendment, hormone receptor (HR)+ , pN0-1 RS ≤ 11 patients were recommended to omit chemotherapy. Patients with RS ≥ 12, pN2-3, or HR-negative/HER2-negative disease were randomised to anthracycline-containing or anthracycline-free chemotherapy. Primary endpoint: disease-free survival (DFS). PlanB Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:  .",
        "Results/Findings": "From 2009 to 2011, PlanB enrolled 3198 patients (central tumour bank, n = 3073) with the median age of 56 years, 41.1% pN+, and 32.5% grade 3 EBC. Chemotherapy was omitted in 348/404 (86.1%) eligible RS ≤ 11 patients. After 55 months of median follow-up, five-year DFS in ET-treated RS ≤ 11 patients was 94% (in both pN0 and pN1) versus 94% (RS 12-25) and 84% (RS > 25) in chemotherapy-treated patients (p < 0.001); five-year overall survival (OS) was 99 versus 97% and 93%, respectively (p < 0.001). Nodal status, central/local grade, tumour size, continuous Ki-67, progesterone receptor (PR), IHC4, and RS were univariate prognostic factors for DFS. In a multivariate analysis including all univariate prognostic markers, only pN2-3, central and local grade 3, tumour size >2 cm, and RS, but not IHC4 or Ki-67 were independent adverse factors. If RS was excluded, IHC4 or both Ki-67 and PR entered the model. The impact of RS was particularly pronounced in patients with intermediate Ki-67 (>10%, <40%) tumours.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The excellent five-year outcomes in clinically high-risk, genomically low-risk (RS ≤ 11) pN0-1 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy support using RS with standardised pathology for treatment decisions in HR+ HER2-negative EBC.

The median age was 52+/-11 years (range 32-79 years). All PET studies results were correlated with follow-up surgical pathology results. A cut off value of 2.5 was considered for positive or negative PET results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with FN results.",

Among the 31 benign lesions, 30 were true negative and one was false positive. There was significant difference in the tumor size (p=0.003) and tumor grade (p=0.001) in patients with TP and FN PET results. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that tumor size (< or =10 mm) and low tumor grade were independently associated with FN results.

        "es_title": "Sentinel -lymph- node biopsy in patients with breast cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (SENTINA): a prospective, multicentre cohort study",
        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "SENTINA is a four-arm, prospective, multicentre cohort study undertaken at 103 institutions in Germany and Austria. Women with breast cancer who were scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled into the study. Patients with clinically node-negative disease (cN0) underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm A). If the sentinel node was positive (pN1), a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure was done after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B). Women with clinically node-positive disease (cN+) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those who converted to clinically node-negative disease after chemotherapy (ycN0; arm C) were treated with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and axillary dissection. Only patients whose clinical nodal status remained positive (ycN1) underwent axillary dissection without sentinel-lymph-node biopsy (arm D). The primary endpoint was accuracy (false-negative rate) of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients who converted from cN1 to ycN0 disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm C). Secondary endpoints included comparison of the detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and also the false-negative rate and detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after removal of the sentinel lymph node. Analyses were done according to treatment received (per protocol).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1737 patients who received treatment, 1022 women underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arms A and B), with a detection rate of 99.1% (95% CI 98.3-99.6; 1013 of 1022). In patients who converted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from cN+ to ycN0 (arm C), the detection rate was 80.1% (95% CI 76.6-83.2; 474 of 592) and false-negative rate was 14.2% (95% CI 9.9-19.4; 32 of 226). The false-negative rate was 24.3% (17 of 70) for women who had one node removed and 18.5% (10 of 54) for those who had two sentinel nodes removed (arm C). In patients who had a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B), the detection rate was 60.8% (95% CI 55.6-65.9; 219 of 360) and the false-negative rate was 51.6% (95% CI 38.7-64.2; 33 of 64).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is a reliable diagnostic method before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After systemic treatment or early sentinel-lymph-node biopsy, the procedure has a lower detection rate and a higher false-negative rate compared with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy done before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These limitations should be considered if biopsy is planned after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In a composite, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial done in the UK and South Korea, postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer (oestrogen receptor [ER] positive, progesterone receptor [PR] positive, or both) were eligible if they had relapsed or progressed with locally advanced or metastatic disease on an NSAI (given as adjuvant for at least 12 months or as first-line treatment for at least 6 months). Additionally, patients had to have adequate organ function and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular injection on day 1, followed by 250 mg doses on days 15 and 29, and then every 28 days) plus daily oral anastrozole (1 mg); fulvestrant plus anastrozole-matched placebo; or daily oral exemestane (25 mg). Randomisation was done with computer-generated permuted blocks, and stratification was by centre and previous use of an NSAI as adjuvant treatment or for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Participants and investigators were aware of assignment to fulvestrant or exemestane, but not of assignment to anastrozole or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers   (UK) and   (South Korea).",
        "Results/Findings": "Between March 26, 2004, and Aug 6, 2010, 723 patients underwent randomisation: 243 were assigned to receive fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 231 to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 249 to exemestane. Median PFS was 4·4 months (95% CI 3·4-5·4) in patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 4·8 months (3·6-5·5) in those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 3·4 months (3·0-4·6) in those assigned to exemestane. No difference was recorded between the patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole and fulvestrant plus placebo (hazard ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·83-1·21; log-rank p=0·98), or between those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo and exemestane (0·95, 0·79-1·14; log-rank p=0·56). 87 serious adverse events were reported: 36 in patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 22 in those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 29 in those assigned to exemestane. Grade 3-4 adverse events were rare; the most frequent were arthralgia (three in the group assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole; seven in that assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo; eight in that assigned to exemestane), lethargy (three; 11; 11), and nausea or vomiting (five; two; eight).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After loss of response to NSAIs in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, maximum double endocrine treatment with 250 mg fulvestrant combined with oestrogen deprivation is no better than either fulvestrant alone or exemestane.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "The authors searched the MEDLINE database for studies of radiation therapy and breast reconstruction with most patients treated after 1985 and mean follow-up of more than 1 year. Forty-nine articles were reviewed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Even with the latest prosthetic materials and modern radiation delivery techniques, the complication rate for implant-based breast reconstruction in patients undergoing postmastectomy radiation therapy is greater than 40 percent, and the extrusion rate is 15 percent. Modified sequencing of two-stage implant reconstruction, such that the expander is exchanged for the permanent implant before postmastectomy radiation therapy, results in higher rates of capsular contracture and is not generally feasible after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Current evidence suggests that postmastectomy radiation therapy also adversely affects autologous tissue reconstruction. Even with modern radiation delivery techniques, immediate implant-based or autologous tissue breast reconstruction can distort the chest wall and limit the ability to treat the targeted tissues without excessive exposure of the heart and lungs. In patients for whom postmastectomy radiation therapy appears likely but may not be required, \"delayed-immediate reconstruction,\" in which tissue expanders are placed at mastectomy, avoids the difficulties associated with radiation delivery after immediate reconstruction and preserves the opportunity for the aesthetic benefits of skin-sparing mastectomy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients who will receive or have already received postmastectomy radiation therapy, the optimal approach is delayed autologous tissue reconstruction after postmastectomy radiation therapy. If postmastectomy radiation therapy appears likely but may not be required, delayed-immediate reconstruction may be considered.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 104 patients met the study criteria. The most common presenting symptoms were nipple discharge and eczematous changes of the nipple/areola complex. Ninety-seven patients (93.2%) had an underlying invasive or noninvasive cancer associated with Paget's disease. Ninety-two patients (88.5%) underwent mastectomy, and 12 (11.5%) had a breast-conserving procedure. On univariate analysis, patients with age <60 years at diagnosis, stage II disease, positive lymph nodes, invasive disease, or a palpable mass had significantly lower 10-year disease-specific and recurrence-free survival.

        "Methods": "The TRAIN-2 study is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial being done in 37 hospitals in the Netherlands. We recruited patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly allocated using central randomisation software (1:1 ratio) with minimisation without a random component, stratified by tumour stage, nodal stage, oestrogen receptor status, and age, to receive 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m ), epirubicin (90 mg/m ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m ) every 3 weeks for three cycles followed by paclitaxel (80 mg/m  on days 1 and 8) and carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL per min on day 1 or optionally, as per hospital preference, AUC 3 mg/mL per min on days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks for six cycles, or to receive nine cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin at the same dose and schedule as in the anthracycline group. Patients in both study groups received trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, loading dose 8 mg/kg) and pertuzumab (420 mg, loading dose 840 mg) concurrently with all chemotherapy cycles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response in breast and axilla (ypT0/is ypN0) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one treatment cycle according to actual treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and follow-up for long-term outcome is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 9, 2013, and Jan 14, 2016, 438 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (219 patients to each group), of whom 418 were evaluable for the primary endpoint (212 in the anthracycline group and 206 in the non-anthracycline group). The median follow-up for all patients was 19 months (IQR 16-23 months). A pathological complete response was recorded in 141 (67%, 95% CI 60-73) of 212 patients in the anthracycline group and in 140 (68%, 61-74) of 206 in the non-anthracycline group (p=0·95). One patient randomly allocated to the non-anthracycline group did receive anthracyclines and was thus included in the anthracycline group for safety analyses; therefore, for the safety analyses there were 220 patients in the anthracycline group and 218 in the non-anthracycline group. Serious adverse events were reported in 61 (28%) of 220 patients in the anthracycline group and in 49 (22%) of 218 in the non-anthracycline group. The most common adverse events of any cause were grade 3 or worse neutropenia (in 131 [60%] of 220 patients in the anthracycline group vs 118 [54%] of 218 in the non-anthracycline group), grade 3 or worse diarrhoea (26 [12%] vs 37 [18%]), and grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy (66 [30%] vs 68 [31%]), with no substantial differences between the groups. Grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia was more common in the anthracycline group than in the non-anthracycline group (23 [10%] vs three [1%], p<0·0001). Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was rare in both groups (two [1%] of 220 vs 0 of 218). One patient in the anthracycline group died because of a pulmonary embolism, which was possibly treatment related.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In view of the high proportion of pathological complete responses recorded in both groups and the fact that febrile neutropenia was more frequent in the anthracycline group, omitting anthracyclines from neoadjuvant treatment regimens might be a preferred approach in the presence of dual HER2 blockade in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer.

RS were low in 227 (23.0%) patients, intermediate in 450 (45.5%) patients, and high in 312 (31.5%) patients. Most patients had a T1 (431 [43.6%]) or T2 tumor (451 [45.6%]). Most had N0 disease (757 [76.5%]). Tumor grades were 1 (123 [12.4%]), 2 (517 [52.3%]), or 3 (349 [35.3%]). pCR was achieved by 42 (4.3%) patients.

Clinical variables, time to first progression (TTP), and 2-year overall survival (OS) were correlated with the 21-gene RS by using log-rank, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median patient age was 52 years (21 to 79 years); the majority had hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (72 [66%]) or hormone receptor-positive/HER2-positive (20 [18%]) breast cancer. At a median follow-up of 29 months, median TTP was 20 months (95% CI, 16 to 26 months), and median survival was 49 months (95% CI, 40 months to not reached). An RS was generated for 101 (93%) primary tumor samples: 22 (23%) low risk (< 18), 29 (28%) intermediate risk (18 to 30); and 50 (49%) high risk (≥ 31). For all patients, RS was associated with TTP (P = .01) and 2-year OS (P = .04). In multivariable Cox regression models among 69 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative cancer, RS was independently prognostic for TTP (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.86; P = .02) and 2-year OS (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.95; P = .013).",

Separate analysis was performed for patients with T1 or T2 primary disease and one to three involved nodes (n = 404). Those with fewer than 10 nodes examined were at increased risk of LRR compared with those with >/= 10 nodes examined (24% v 11%; P =.02).

Patients with ER-positive DCIS treated with tamoxifen (v placebo) showed significant decreases in subsequent breast cancer at 10 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; P < .001) and overall follow-up (HR, 0.60; P = .003), which remained significant in multivariable analysis (overall HR, 0.64; P = .003). Results were similar, but less significant, when subsequent ipsilateral and contralateral, invasive and noninvasive, breast cancers were considered separately. No significant benefit was observed in ER-negative DCIS. PgR and either receptor were positive in 66% and 79% of patients, respectively, and in general, neither was more predictive than ER alone.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients in NSABP B-24 with ER-positive DCIS receiving adjuvant tamoxifen after standard therapy showed significant reductions in subsequent breast cancer. The use of adjuvant tamoxifen should be considered for patients with DCIS.",

        "Methods": "Patients (N = 2,305) were randomized to receive either four courses of standard AC therapy (group 1); intensified therapy, in which the same total dose of cyclophosphamide was administered in two courses (group 2); or intensified and increased therapy, in which the total dose of cyclophosphamide was doubled (group 3). The dose and intensity of doxorubicin were similar in all groups. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were determined using life-table estimates.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no significant difference in DFS (P = .30) or overall survival (P = .95) among the groups through 5 years.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Published studies were identified and abstracted from MEDLINE and other sources. We include articles published between 1965 and January 31, 2009; 374 publications were identified that addressed DCIS incidence, staging, treatment, and outcomes in adult women.",
        "Results/Findings": "In the United States, DCIS incidence rose from 1.87 per 100 000 in 1973-1975 to 32.5 in 2004. Incidence increased in all ages but more so in women older than 50 years. Increased use of mammography explains some but not all of the increased incidence. Risk factors for incident DCIS include older age and family history. Although tamoxifen treatment prevented both invasive breast cancer and DCIS, raloxifene treatment decreased incidence of invasive breast cancer but not DCIS. Among patients with DCIS, magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than mammography for detecting multicentric disease and estimating tumor size. Because about 15% of patients with DCIS identified on core needle biopsy are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after excision or mastectomy, the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy after excision is relevant to surgical management of DCIS. Most studies demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy is feasible after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Younger age, positive surgical margins, tumor size and grade, and comedo necrosis were consistently related to DCIS recurrence. DCIS outcomes after either mastectomy or BCS plus radiation therapy were superior to BCS alone. Tamoxifen treatment after DCIS diagnosis reduced risk of recurrent disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Scientific questions deserving further investigation include the relationship between mammography use and DCIS incidence and whether imaging technologies and treatment guidelines can be modified to focus on lesions that are most likely to become clinically problematic.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients with primary invasive breast cancer (cN0 and cT ≤ 3 cm) were randomized before surgery for cALND (standard treatment) or RNI (investigational treatment). Sentinel lymph nodes (SN) were investigated with serial sectioning at 0.5 mm levels by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Investigational treatment arm patients received 50 Gy RNI instead of cALND. Adjuvant treatment and follow up were performed according to the actual guidelines. Between August 2002 and June 2009, 1054 patients were randomized for cALND and 1052 patients for RNI. SN was evaluated in 2073 patients and was positive in 526 patients (25.4%). 474 cases were evaluable (244 in the cALND and 230 in the RNI arm), and in the cALND group 94 of 244 patients (38.5%) who underwent completion axillary surgery has additional positive nodes. The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors. Primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).",
        "Results/Findings": "Mean follow-up was 97 months (Q1-Q3: 80-120). Axillary recurrence was 2.0% in cALND arm vs. 1.7% in RNI arm (p = 1.00). OS at 8 years was 77.9% vs. 84.8% (p = 0.060), and DFS was 72.1% in cALND arm and 77.4% after RNI (p = 0.51). The results show that RNI is statistically not inferior to cALND treatment.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The long term follow-up results of this prospective-randomized trial suggest that RNI without cALND does not increase the risk of axillary failure in selected patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (cT ≤ 3 cm, cN0) and pN1(sn). Axillary radiotherapy should be an alternative treatment for selected patients with sentinel lymph node metastases.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "MINDACT was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 112 academic and community hospitals in nine European countries. Patients aged 18-70 years, with histologically confirmed primary invasive breast cancer (stage T1, T2, or operable T3) with up to three positive lymph nodes, no distant metastases, and a WHO performance status of 0-1 were enrolled and their genomic risk (using the MammaPrint 70-gene signature) and clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online) were determined. Patients with low clinical and low genomic risk results did not receive chemotherapy, and patients with high clinical and high genomic risk did receive chemotherapy (mostly anthracycline-based or taxane-based, or a combination thereof). Patients with discordant risk results (ie, patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, and those with low clinical risk but high genomic risk) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy or not based on either the clinical risk or the genomic risk. Randomisation was done centrally and used a minimisation technique that was stratified by institution, risk group, and clinical-pathological characteristics. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was to test whether the distant metastasis-free survival rate at 5 years in patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk not receiving chemotherapy had a lower boundary of the 95% CI above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%. In the primary test population of patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who adhered to the treatment allocation of no chemotherapy and had no change in risk post-enrolment. Here, we present updated follow-up as well as an exploratory analysis of a potential age effect (≤50 years vs >50 years) and an analysis by nodal status for patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative disease. These analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and the European Clinical Trials database, EudraCT2005-002625-31. Recruitment is complete and further long-term follow-up is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 8, 2007, and July 11, 2011, 6693 patients were enrolled. On Feb 26, 2020, median follow-up was 8·7 years (IQR 7·8-9·7). The updated 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate for patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk receiving no chemotherapy (primary test population, n=644) was 95·1% (95% CI 93·1-96·6), which is above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%, supporting the previous analysis and proving MINDACT as a positive de-escalation trial. Patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (n=749) or not (n=748); this was the intention-to-treat population. The 8-year estimates for distant metastasis-free survival in the intention-to-treat population were 92·0% (95% CI 89·6-93·8) for chemotherapy versus 89·4% (86·8-91·5) for no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0·66; 95% CI 0·48-0·92). An exploratory analysis confined to the subset of patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease (1358 [90.7%] of 1497 randomly assigned patients, of whom 676 received chemotherapy and 682 did not) shows different effects of chemotherapy administration on 8-year distant metastasis-free survival according to age: 93·6% (95% CI 89·3-96·3) with chemotherapy versus 88·6% (83·5-92·3) without chemotherapy in 464 women aged 50 years or younger (absolute difference 5·0 percentage points [SE 2·8, 95% CI -0·5 to 10·4]) and 90·2% (86·8-92·7) versus 90·0% (86·6-92·6) in 894 women older than 50 years (absolute difference 0·2 percentage points [2·1, -4·0 to 4·4]). The 8-year distant metastasis-free survival in the exploratory analysis by nodal status in these patients was 91·7% (95% CI 88·1-94·3) with chemotherapy and 89·2% (85·2-92·2) without chemotherapy in 699 node-negative patients (absolute difference 2·5 percentage points [SE 2·3, 95% CI -2·1 to 7·2]) and 91·2% (87·2-94·0) versus 89·9% (85·8-92·8) for 658 patients with one to three positive nodes (absolute difference 1·3 percentage points [2·4, -3·5 to 6·1]).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With a more mature follow-up approaching 9 years, the 70-gene signature shows an intact ability of identifying among women with high clinical risk, a subgroup, namely patients with a low genomic risk, with an excellent distant metastasis-free survival when treated with endocrine therapy alone. For these women the magnitude of the benefit from adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy remains small (2·6 percentage points) and is not enhanced by nodal positivity. However, in an underpowered exploratory analysis this benefit appears to be age-dependent, as it is only seen in women younger than 50 years where it reaches a clinically relevant threshold of 5 percentage points. Although, possibly due to chemotherapy-induced ovarian function suppression, it should be part of informed, shared decision making. Further study is needed in younger women, who might need reinforced endocrine therapy to forego chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "A prospective database maintained at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center identified 437 SSMs performed for 372 invasive T1/T2 breast cancers between 1986 and 1993.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-three LRs were identified, with a LR rate of 6.2% (23/372). Twenty-two of these (96%) presented as palpable skin-flap masses. The median time to recurrence was 25 months (range, 3 to 98 months). Fourteen patients were treated with a combination of surgery and systemic therapy. Resection of the reconstructed breast was performed in only three patients. Complete local control of the recurrent disease was achieved in 17 patients (74%). Nine patients (39%) developed distant metastatic disease. At a median follow-up of 26 months, 14 of 23 patients (61%) are alive without evidence of disease, and 7 (30%) have died from breast cancer.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Because LR rate with SSM is low and likelihood of local control and survival is high, SSM and IBR is an acceptable treatment option for early stage breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "We tested whether the results of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 21 prospectively selected genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue would correlate with the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with node-negative, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer who were enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trial B-14. The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient.",
        "Results/Findings": "Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were 51, 22, and 27 percent, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 6.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.6), 14.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.3 to 20.3), and 30.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.6 to 37.4). The rate in the low-risk group was significantly lower than that in the high-risk group (P<0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, the recurrence score provided significant predictive power that was independent of age and tumor size (P<0.001). The recurrence score was also predictive of overall survival (P<0.001) and could be used as a continuous function to predict distant recurrence in individual patients.",

Here, we summarize the various methods available for fertility preservation and minimizing chemotherapy induced gonadotoxicity.",
        "Results/Findings": "Until now, 20 studies (15 retrospective and 5 randomized controlled trial) have reported on 2038 patients treated with GnRH-a in parallel to chemotherapy, showing a significant decrease in premature ovarian failure (POF) rate in survivors versus 8 studies reporting on 509 patients, with negative results. Patients treated with GnRH-a in parallel to chemotherapy preserved their cyclic ovarian function in 91% of cases as compared to 41% of controls, with a pregnancy rate of 19 - 71% in the treated patients. Furthermore, over 10 recent meta-analyses have concluded that GnRH-a are beneficial and may decrease the risk of POF in survivors. Because most of the methods involving ovarian or egg cryopreservation are not yet clinically established and unequivocally successful, these young patients deserve to be informed with all the various modalities to minimize gonadal damage and preserve ovarian function and future fertility. Combining the various modalities for a specific patient may increase the odds of preservation of future fertility.",

Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged over 18 years, did not have an immediate reconstruction, and were available for follow-up. Randomisation method was computer generated and was not blinded. The protocol-specified principal endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse, defined as reappearance of cancer at irradiated sites, late normal tissue effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779.",
        "Results/Findings": "1105 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group and 1110 to the 40 Gy group. After a median follow up of 6.0 years (IQR 5.0-6.2) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 2.2% (95% CI 1.3-3.1) in the 40 Gy group and 3.3% (95% CI 2.2 to 4.5) in the 50 Gy group, representing an absolute difference of -0.7% (95% CI -1.7% to 0.9%)--ie, the absolute difference in local-regional relapse could be up to 1.7% better and at most 1% worse after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments indicated lower rates of late adverse effects after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A radiation schedule delivering 40 Gy in 15 fractions seems to offer rates of local-regional tumour relapse and late adverse effects at least as favourable as the standard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions.",

        "Results/Findings": "749 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group, 750 to the 41.6 Gy group, and 737 to the 39 Gy group. After a median follow up of 5.1 years (IQR 4.4-6.0) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 3.6% (95% CI 2.2-5.1) after 50 Gy, 3.5% (95% CI 2.1-4.3) after 41.6 Gy, and 5.2% (95% CI 3.5-6.9) after 39 Gy.

From a planned meta-analysis with the pilot trial, the adjusted estimates of alpha/beta value for tumour control was 4.6 Gy (95% CI 1.1-8.1) and for late change in breast appearance (photographic) was 3.4 Gy (95% CI 2.3-4.5).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The data are consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancer and the dose-limiting normal tissues respond similarly to change in radiotherapy fraction size. 41.6 Gy in 13 fractions was similar to the control regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions in terms of local-regional tumour control and late normal tissue effects, a result consistent with the result of START Trial B. A lower total dose in a smaller number of fractions could offer similar rates of tumour control and normal tissue damage as the international standard fractionation schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions.",

Patients completed monthly bleeding calendars from the time of study recruitment. Updated medical history data were obtained at 6-month intervals.",

Approximately 41% of women experienced an initial 6 months of CIA, and an additional 29% had at least 1 year of CIA. Approximately half of the women with 6 months of CIA and 29% of those with 1 year of CIA resumed bleeding within the subsequent 3 years, usually in the year after their amenorrheic episode. Resumption of bleeding differed significantly by treatment regimen after 6 months of CIA (P = .002; 68% with AC, 57% with ACT, and 23% with CMF), but not after 1 year of CIA (P = .5). Of the 23% of women who experienced an initial 2-year period of CIA, 10% resumed bleeding within the ensuing 3 years after their amenorrheic episode, but none had regular menses.",

        "Methods": "We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or with trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women).",
        "Results/Findings": "The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management.",

Consistent PFS benefit was observed across subgroups. Although OS data were not mature, a trend favoring Dato-DXd was observed (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.14]). The rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) with Dato-DXd was lower than ICC (20.8%   44.7%).

Gail's algorithm, based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors, was used to estimate the probability (risk) of occurrence of breast cancer over time.",
        "Results/Findings": "Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two-sided P<.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger (44%), 50-59 years (51%), and 60 years or older (55%); risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002). Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors was seen. Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles'), and spine fractures was observed. The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older. All endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group were stage I (localized disease); no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group. No liver cancers or increase in colon, rectal, ovarian, or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group. The rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group; these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer. Despite side effects resulting from administration of tamoxifen, its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease.",

Randomisation was done centrally, stratifying patients by institute, carcinoma stage (I or II), and menopausal status. BCT comprised of lumpectomy and complete axillary clearance, followed by breast radiotherapy and a tumour-bed boost. The primary endpoint was time to distant metastasis. This analysis was done on all eligible patients, as they were randomised.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 22·1 years (IQR 18·5-23·8), 175 patients (42%) had distant metastases in the MRM group versus 207 (46%) in the BCT group. Furthermore, 506 patients (58%) died (232 [55%] in the MRM group and 274 [61%] in the BCT group). No significant difference was observed between BCT and MRM for time to distant metastases (hazard ratio 1·13, 95% CI 0·92-1·38; p=0·23) or for time to death (1·11, 0·94-1·33; 0·23). Cumulative incidence of distant metastases at 20 years was 42·6% (95% CI 37·8-47·5) in the MRM group and 46·9% (42·2-51·6) in the BCT group. 20-year overall survival was estimated to be 44·5% (95% CI 39·3-49·5) in the MRM group and 39·1% (34·4-43·9) in the BCT group. There was no difference between the groups in time to distant metastases or overall survival by age (time to distant metastases: <50 years 1·09 [95% CI 0·79-1·51] vs ≥50 years 1·16 [0·90-1·50]; overall survival <50 years 1·17 [0·86-1·59] vs ≥50 years 1·10 [0·89-1·37]).",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Eighty patients with newly diagnosed with breast cancer who were beginning tamoxifen therapy (20 mg/day orally), 24 of whom were taking CYP2D6 inhibitors, were genotyped for common alleles of the CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A5, and sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 genes. Plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites were measured after 1 and 4 months of tamoxifen therapy. Differences in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites between genotype groups were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among all women, plasma endoxifen concentrations after 4 months of tamoxifen therapy were statistically significantly lower in subjects with a CYP2D6 homozygous variant genotype (20.0 nM, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.1 to 28.9 nM) or a heterozygous genotype (43.1 nM, 95% CI = 33.3 to 52.9 nM) than in those with a homozygous wild-type genotype (78.0 nM, 95%CI = 65.9 to 90.1 nM) (both P = .003). Among subjects who carried a homozygous wild-type genotype, the mean plasma endoxifen concentration for those who were using CYP2D6 inhibitors was 58% lower than that for those who were not (38.6 nM versus 91.4 nM, difference = -52.8 nM, 95% CI = -86.1 to -19.5 nM, P = .0025). The plasma endoxifen concentration was slightly reduced in women taking venlafaxine, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, whereas the plasma endoxifen concentration was reduced substantially in subjects who took paroxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6). Genetic variations of CYP2C9, CYP3A5, or SULT1A1 had no statistically significant associations with plasma concentrations of tamoxifen or its metabolites.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "The randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was designed to evaluate anastrozole 1 mg once daily relative to tamoxifen 20 mg once daily in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors or tumors of unknown receptor status who were eligible for endocrine therapy. Primary end points were objective response (OR), defined as complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, time to progression (TTP), and tolerability.",
        "Results/Findings": "Anastrozole was as effective as tamoxifen in terms of OR (21% v 17% of patients, respectively), with clinical benefit (CR + PR + stabilization > or = 24 weeks) observed in 59% of patients on anastrozole and 46% on tamoxifen (two-sided P =.0098, retrospective analysis). Anastrozole had a significant advantage over tamoxifen in terms of TTP (median TTP of 11.1 and 5.6 months for anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively; two-sided P =.005). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 1.44 (lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 1.16). Both treatments were well tolerated. However, thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients who received anastrozole compared with those who received tamoxifen (4.1% v 8.2% [thromboembolic events] and 1.2% v 3.8% [vaginal bleeding], respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole satisfied the predefined criteria for equivalence to tamoxifen. Furthermore, we observed both a significant increase in TTP and a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding with anastrozole. These findings indicate that anastrozole should be considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.",

Other treatment was independent of laterality. The primary study end point was OS. Secondary end points were distant recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Analyses were by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "During 2003-2007, 3,089 women were allocated to IMNI (right-sided, n = 1,491) or no IMNI (left-sided, n = 1,598).

Survival rates, the incidences of IBTR and distant metastases, and annual rates of IBTR and distant metastases after primary operation were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risks of IBTR and distant metastases. A Cox model was also used to estimate the risks of distant metastases after IBTR in the group of IBTR.",

The 10-year cumulative rates of IBTR were 8.5% in the patients with postoperative irradiation and 17.2% in the patients without irradiation. The 10-year cumulative distant metastasis rate was 10.9%. On multivariate analysis, young age, positive surgical margin, and omission of radiation therapy were significant predictors of IBTR. In addition, IBTR significantly correlated with subsequent distant metastases (hazard ratio, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 2.676-5.771; P < 0.0001). Among patients who developed IBTR, initial lymph node metastases and short interval to IBTR were significant risk factors for subsequent distant metastasis.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Young age, positive surgical margin, and omission of radiation therapy seemed to be important factors in relation to local control. The authors' results also indicated that IBTR is significantly associated with subsequent distant metastasis. Patients with positive nodal status at primary operation or with short interval from primary operation to IBTR are at especially high risk of distant metastasis. It remains unclear, however, whether IBTR is an indicator or a cause of subsequent distant metastases.",

        "Methods": "All patients seen in a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic from July 2004 to December 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were evaluated by a radiologist, a pathologist, and surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 577 patients, 130 had pretreatment MRIs. MRI use increased from 2004 (referent, 13%) versus 2005 (24%, p=0.014) and 2006 (27%, p=0.002). Patients having MRIs were younger (52.5 versus 59.0 years, p < 0.001), but its use was not associated with preoperative chemotherapy, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, presentation, or tumor features. MRI was associated with a 22.4-day delay in pretreatment evaluation (p=0.011). Breast conserving therapy (BCT) was attempted in 320 of 419 patients with complete surgical data. The odds ratio for mastectomy, controlling for T size and stage, was 1.80 after MRI versus no MRI (p=0.024). Patients having MRIs did not have fewer positive margins at lumpectomy (21.6% MRI versus 13.8% no MRI, p=0.20), or conversions from BCT to mastectomy (9.8% MRI versus 5.9% no MRI, p=0.35).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI use was not confined to any particular patient group. MRI use was not associated with improved margin status or BCT attempts, but was associated with a treatment delay and increased mastectomy rate. Without evidence of improved oncologic outcomes as a result, our study does not support the routine use of MRI to select patients or facilitate the performance of BCT.",

Patients were stratified according to prior or no prior receipt of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Fulvestrant was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly thereafter. The primary end point was progression-free survival, with overall survival designated as a prespecified secondary outcome.",

No patients with normal BMD at baseline became osteoporotic at 5 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anastrozole is associated with accelerated bone loss over the 5-year treatment period. However, although patients with pre-existing osteopenia are likely to require monitoring and bone-protection strategies, patients with normal BMD would not appear to require monitoring beyond the recommendation for healthy postmenopausal women.

        "Results/Findings": "Adverse surgical effects were reported in 70% (278 of 399) of patients after SLND + ALND and 25% (103 of 411) after SLND alone (P <or= .001). Patients in the SLND + ALND group had more wound infections (P <or= .0016), seromas (P <or= .0001), and paresthesias (P <or= .0001) than those in the SLND-alone group. At 1 year, lymphedema was reported subjectively by 13% (37 of 288) of patients after SLND + ALND and 2% (six of 268) after SLND alone (P <or= .0001). The difference between the two groups' lymphedema, assessed by arm measurements at 30 days (P = .36), 6 months (P = .22), and 1 year (P = .078), although close to the cutoff for significance at 1 year, was not significant. BPIs occurred in less than 1% of patients.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In trial Z0011, the use of SLND + ALND resulted in more wound infections, axillary seromas, and paresthesias than SLND alone. Lymphedema was more common after SLND + ALND but was significantly different only by subjective report. The use of SLND alone resulted in fewer complications.",

After definitive surgery, patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo (placebo-chemotherapy group) every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were pathological complete response (the results for which have been reported previously) and event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, occurrence of a second primary cancer, or death from any cause. Safety was also assessed.",

Optional tumour banking yielded specimens for determination of recurrence score by RT-PCR. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed the effect of recurrence score on disease-free survival by treatment group (tamoxifen vs CAF-T) using Cox regression, adjusting for number of positive nodes.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 367 specimens (40% of the 927 patients in the tamoxifen and CAF-T groups) with sufficient RNA for analysis (tamoxifen, n=148; CAF-T, n=219). The recurrence score was prognostic in the tamoxifen-alone group (p=0.006; hazard ratio [HR] 2.64, 95% CI 1.33-5.27, for a 50-point difference in recurrence score). There was no benefit of CAF in patients with a low recurrence score (score <18; log-rank p=0.97; HR 1.02, 0.54-1.93), but an improvement in disease-free survival for those with a high recurrence score (score > or =31; log-rank p=0.033; HR 0.59, 0.35-1.01), after adjustment for number of positive nodes. The recurrence score by treatment interaction was significant in the first 5 years (p=0.029), with no additional prediction beyond 5 years (p=0.58), although the cumulative benefit remained at 10 years. Results were similar for overall survival and breast-cancer-specific survival.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The recurrence score is prognostic for tamoxifen-treated patients with positive nodes and predicts significant benefit of CAF in tumours with a high recurrence score.

Nodal status, central and local grade, the Ki-67 protein encoded by the MKI67 gene, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, tumor size, and RS were univariate prognostic factors for disease-free survival; only nodal status, both central and local grade, and RS were independent multivariate factors. Histologic grade was discordant between central and local laboratories in 44%. RS was positively but moderately correlated with the Ki-67 protein encoded by the MKI67 gene and grade and negatively correlated with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor.",

The 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of LRR was 4.% (95% CI, 2.3% to 6.3%) for patients with a low RS (< 18), 7.2% (95% CI, 3.4% to 11.0%) for those with intermediate RS (18-30), and 15.8% (95% CI, 10.4% to 21.2%) for those with a high RS (> 30). There were also significant associations between RS and LRR in placebo-treated patients from B-14 (P = .022) and in chemotherapy plus tamoxifen-treated patients from B-20 (P = .028). In multivariate analysis, RS was an independent significant predictor of LRR along with age and type of initial treatment.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Similar to the association between RS and risk for distant recurrence, a significant association exists between RS and risk for LRR. This information has biologic consequences and potential clinical implications relative to locoregional therapy decisions for patients with node-negative and ER-positive breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "The endpoints that we assessed were objective response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Efficacy data for paclitaxel and docetaxel were separately analyzed. Trials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library searches and abstracts of major international conferences.",
        "Results/Findings": "Omicronbjective response rate was notably better when paclitaxel was used as every three weeks regimen (7 studies, 1772 patients, fixed effect model pooled RR 1.20 95%CI 1.08-1.32 p<0.001). No difference were found for PFS (6 studies, 1610 patients, random effect model HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.81-1.30 p=0.860); while OS was statistically higher among patients receiving weekly paclitaxel (5 studies, 1471 patients, fixed effect model pooled HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67-0.89 p=0.001). No differences were observed for the weekly compared to the every three weeks use of docetaxel either for objective response, PFS and OS. Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events, neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and peripheral neuropathy were significantly lower in weekly taxanes schedules. The incidence of nail changes and epiphora were significantly lower in the every three weeks docetaxel regimens.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Use of paclitaxel in weekly regimen give overall survival advantages compared with the standard every three weeks regimen. The observed survival benefit does not seem to stem from an increased potency of the drug with weekly regimens. The use of weekly paclitaxel regimens is therefore recommended for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",

Overall survival and toxicity were predefined, important secondary outcomes for each objective. Patients in this open-label trial were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm in a 2:3:3 ratio (tamoxifen:CAF-T:CAFT) and analysis was by intention to treat of eligible patients. Groups were compared by stratified log-rank tests, followed by Cox regression analyses adjusted for significant prognostic factors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1558 randomised women, 1477 (95%) were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. After a maximum of 13 years of follow-up (median 8.94 years), 637 women had a disease-free survival event (tamoxifen, 179 events in 361 patients; CAF-T, 216 events in 566 patients; CAFT, 242 events in 550 patients). For the first objective, therapy with the CAF plus tamoxifen groups combined (CAFT or CAF-T) was superior to tamoxifen alone for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (adjusted Cox regression hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.91; p=0.002) but only marginally for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (HR 0.83, 0.68-1.01; p=0.057). For the second objective, the adjusted HRs favoured CAF-T over CAFT but did not reach significance for disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 0.70-1.01; p=0.061) or overall survival (HR 0.90, 0.73-1.10; p=0.30). Neutropenia, stomatitis, thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and leukaemia were more frequent in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Chemotherapy with CAF plus tamoxifen given sequentially is more effective adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer than is tamoxifen alone.

After a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 3.9-6.3 years), there were 14 neoplastic events with tamoxifen and 28 with placebo (11.6   23.9 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.92;   = .02), which resulted in a 5-year number needed to treat of 22 (95% CI, 20 to 27). Tamoxifen decreased contralateral breast events by 75% (three   12 events; hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88;   = .02). Patient-reported outcomes were not different between arms except for a slight increase in frequency of daily hot flashes with tamoxifen (  = .02). There were 12 serious adverse events with tamoxifen and 16 with placebo, including one deep vein thrombosis and one stage I endometrial cancer with tamoxifen and one pulmonary embolism with placebo.",

For this analysis, data are reported only in the TAM groups. RT was allowed either before adjuvant therapy (sequential [SEQ] RT; 107 patients) or after chemotherapy but concurrent with TAM (concurrent [CONC] RT; 202 patients). Survival data were adjusted for receptor status, age, and tumor size.",

We collected clinical characteristics and information on subsequent tumors, defined as invasive breast cancer or DCIS diagnosed in the ipsilateral breast containing the initial DCIS lesion or at a regional or distant site greater than 6 months after initial treatment of DCIS (N = 324). We also conducted standardized pathology reviews and immunohistochemical staining for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, Ki67 antigen, p53, p16, epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ERBB2, HER2/neu oncoprotein), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) on the initial paraffin-embedded DCIS tissue. Competing risk models were used to determine factors associated with risk of subsequent invasive cancer vs DCIS, and cumulative incidence survival functions were used to estimate 8-year risk.",
        "Results/Findings": "Factors associated with subsequent invasive cancer differed from those associated with subsequent DCIS. Eight-year risk of subsequent invasive cancer was statistically significantly (P = .018) higher for women with initial DCIS lesions that were detected by palpation or that were p16, COX-2, and Ki67 triple positive (p16(+)COX-2(+)Ki67(+)) (19.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.0% to 21.3%) than for women with initial lesions that were detected by mammography and were p16, COX-2, and Ki67 triple negative (p16(-)COX-2(-)Ki67(-)) (4.1%, 95% CI = 3.4% to 5.0%). In a multivariable model, DCIS lesions that were p16(+)COX-2(+)Ki67(+) or those detected by palpation were statistically significantly associated with subsequent invasive cancer, but nuclear grade was not. Eight-year risk of subsequent DCIS was highest for women with DCIS lesions that had disease-free margins of 1 mm or greater combined with either ER(-)ERBB2(+)Ki67(+) or p16(+)COX-2(-)Ki67(+) status (23.6%, 95% CI = 18.1% to 34.0%).",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In 1986-98, we randomly assigned 1410 women with invasive breast cancer (tumour stage 1-3 with a maximum of one positive node and no metastasis) who had had local tumour excision of early stage breast cancer to receive 50 Gy radiotherapy given in 25 fractions, 39 Gy given in 13 fractions, or 42.9 Gy given in 13 fractions, all given over 5 weeks. The primary endpoint was late change in breast appearance, which has been reported elsewhere. Here, we report ipsilateral tumour relapse, one of the secondary endpoints. Relapse was defined as any appearance of cancer in the irradiated breast. Analysis was by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 9.7 years (IQR 7.8-11.8) for the 838 (95%) patients who survived, the risk of ipsilateral tumour relapse after 10 years was 12.1% (95% CI 8.8-15.5) in the 50 Gy group, 14.8% (11.2-18.3) in the 39 Gy group, and 9.6% (6.7-12.6) in the 42.9 Gy group (difference between 39 Gy and 42.9 Gy groups, chi2 test, p=0.027). The sensitivity of breast cancer to dose per fraction was estimated to be 4.0 Gy (95% CI 1.0-7.8), similar to that estimated for the late adverse effects in healthy tissue from breast radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast cancer tissue is probably just as sensitive to fraction size as dose-limiting healthy tissues.

The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in ≥10% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was associated with durable objective responses in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Myelotoxic effects were the main adverse reactions. (Funded by Immunomedics; IMMU-132-01 ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We reviewed data from 1,218 consecutive cases of breast cancer. Pathological and biological parameters and instrumental procedures performed at the time of diagnosis and during 6 months of follow-up were recorded. True positive and negative, false positive and negative cases were evaluated. All cases were grouped on the basis of tumour size, nodal involvement, biological characteristics, menopausal status and age.",
        "Results/Findings": "We observed 46 (3.8%) true positive cases with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Documentation relating to BS, CXR and LUS was available for 1,193, 1,206 and 1,206 patients, respectively, with 37 (3.1%), 8 (0.7%) and 10 (0.8%) true positive tests. Logistic regression analysis showed significant odds ratio estimates for pT status and nodal status, thus highlighting the role of these morphological data. These findings suggest that breast cancer patients can be divided into two subgroups: first group pT1-3N0-1. with < or = 3 involved nodes, and second group pT1-3N1 with > or = 4 involved nodes, pT4 and pN2 (metastases detection rate 1.46 and 10.68%, respectively). In the former group the appropriate procedures of staging would only be laboratory parameters, whereas in the latter group BS, CXR, LUS, LP and tumour markers CEA and CA 15.3 would.be necessary.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The standard staging procedures to detect metastatic disease at breast cancer diagnosis require modification. On the basis of the literature data and our findings, the full staging procedure is appropriate in the second group of patients.",

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 81 female and 69 males responded in 2004, and 69 females and 71 males in 2011. In both years, most males reported fertility discussions taking place before treatment started and they were generally satisfied with it.

        "Methods": "A retrospective review was performed that included 38 consecutive patients with high-risk breast carcinoma who underwent SSM and immediate reconstruction (between July 1996 and January 2002). Tumor characteristics, type of reconstruction, margin status, timing of adjuvant therapy, postoperative complications, and incidence of recurrence were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "High-risk patients (Stage IIA [n=4 patients] Stage IIB [n=23 patients] Stage IIIA [n=8 patients] and Stage IIIB [n=3 patients]) underwent immediate reconstruction after SSM with the use of a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (n=31 patients), a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap plus an implant (n=3 patients), or tissue expanders with subsequent implant placement (n=4 patients). The median follow-up was 52.9 months (range, 27.5-92.0 months), and the median time to recurrence has not yet been reached at the time of last follow-up. The median interval from surgery to the initiation of postoperative adjuvant therapy was 38 days (range, 25-238 days). Local recurrence was seen in 1 patient (2.6%), systemic recurrence in was seen in 10 patients (26.3%), and both local and distant metastases in were seen in 2 other patients (5.3%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SSM with immediate reconstruction appeared to be an oncologically safe treatment option for high-risk patients with advanced stages of breast carcinoma. In addition to the aesthetic and psychological benefits of performing SSM with immediate reconstruction, local recurrence rates and disease-free survival were favorable when combined with the use of radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, as indicated.",

        "Results/Findings": "In univariate analysis, reduced mortality was weakly associated with higher vegetable-fruit consumption, increased physical activity, and a body mass index that was neither low weight nor obese. In a multivariate Cox model, only the combination of consuming five or more daily servings of vegetables-fruits, and accumulating 540+ metabolic equivalent tasks-min/wk (equivalent to walking 30 minutes 6 d/wk), was associated with a significant survival advantage (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.98). The approximate 50% reduction in risk associated with these healthy lifestyle behaviors was observed in both obese and nonobese women, although fewer obese women were physically active with a healthy dietary pattern (16% v 30%). Among those who adhered to this healthy lifestyle, there was no apparent effect of obesity on survival. The effect was stronger in women who had hormone receptor-positive cancers.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A minority of breast cancer survivors follow a healthy lifestyle that includes both recommended intakes of vegetables-fruits and moderate levels of physical activity. The strong protective effect observed suggests a need for additional investigation of the effect of the combined influence of diet and physical activity on breast cancer survival.",

We compared progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the 2 cohorts.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 163 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria, 75 received gemcitabine and 88 carboplatin-gemcitabine. Patients in the combination cohort had received a lower number of previous chemotherapy lines (2 vs. 3), and were less likely to have received carboplatin (9 patients [10%] vs. 34 patients [45%]; P < .0001). We found no PFS differences in carboplatin-gemcitabine and gemcitabine cohorts (4.24 vs. 4.61 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; P = .92), whereas the combination was associated with a trend toward higher ORR (18 patients [20.4%] vs. 8 patients [10.6%]; P = .089) and with significantly higher incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia (30 patients [34%] vs. 5 patients [6.6%]; P < .0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Using carboplatin in addition to gemcitabine is associated with more hematologic AEs but not with better PFS. Although single-agent gemcitabine remains a treatment option for heavily pretreated mBC patients, finding biomarkers of response to platinum salts might help to identify patients more likely to benefit from carboplatin-gemcitabine.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients with microscopically complete excision for invasive disease followed by whole-breast irradiation of 50 Gy in 5 weeks were centrally randomised (1:1) with a minimisation algorithm to receive 16 Gy boost or no boost, with minimisation for age, menopausal status, presence of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, clinical tumour size, nodal status, and institution. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May 24, 1989, and June 25, 1996, 2657 patients were randomly assigned to receive no radiation boost and 2661 patients randomly assigned to receive a radiation boost. Median follow-up was 17.2 years (IQR 13.0-19.0). 20-year overall survival was 59.7% (99% CI 56.3-63.0) in the boost group versus 61.1% (57.6-64.3) in the no boost group, hazard ratio (HR) 1.05 (99% CI 0.92-1.19, p=0.323). Ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was the first treatment failure for 354 patients (13%) in the no boost group versus 237 patients (9%) in the boost group, HR 0.65 (99% CI 0.52-0.81, p<0.0001). The 20-year cumulative incidence of ipsilatelal breast tumour recurrence was 16.4% (99% CI 14.1-18.8) in the no boost group versus 12.0% (9.8-14.4) in the boost group. Mastectomies as first salvage treatment for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence occurred in 279 (79%) of 354 patients in the no boost group versus 178 (75%) of 237 in the boost group. The cumulative incidence of severe fibrosis at 20 years was 1.8% (99% CI 1.1-2.5) in the no boost group versus 5.2% (99% CI 3.9-6.4) in the boost group (p<0.0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A radiation boost after whole-breast irradiation has no effect on long-term overall survival, but can improve local control, with the largest absolute benefit in young patients, although it increases the risk of moderate to severe fibrosis. The extra radiation dose can be avoided in most patients older than age 60 years.",

Only minor, but significant, differences in shoulder mobility were observed comparing the two groups of node negative patients. Highly significant difference was found comparing sensibility. Comparing the morbidity in node positive patients who had a one-step axillary dissection with patients having a two-step procedure (sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by delayed axillary dissection) revealed no difference in objective or subjective arm morbidity.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "The primary outcome measures were arm and shoulder morbidity and quality of life. From November 1999 to October 2003, 1031 patients were randomly assigned to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (n = 515) or standard axillary surgery (n = 516). Patients with sentinel lymph node metastases proceeded to delayed axillary clearance or received axillary radiotherapy (depending on the protocol at the treating institution). Intention-to-treat analyses of data at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery are presented. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "The relative risks of any lymphedema and sensory loss for the sentinel lymph node biopsy group compared with the standard axillary treatment group at 12 months were 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23 to 0.60; absolute rates: 5% versus 13%) and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.27 to 0.50; absolute rates: 11% versus 31%), respectively. Drain usage, length of hospital stay, and time to resumption of normal day-to-day activities after surgery were statistically significantly lower in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group (all P < .001), and axillary operative time was reduced (P = .055). Overall patient-recorded quality of life and arm functioning scores were statistically significantly better in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group throughout (all P < or = .003). These benefits were seen with no increase in anxiety levels in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group (P > .05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated with reduced arm morbidity and better quality of life than standard axillary treatment and should be the treatment of choice for patients who have early-stage breast cancer with clinically negative nodes.",

Nineteen patients had no associated clinical/radiographic features (\"Paget's only\"), and 20 patients had associated clinical/radiographic findings (\"Paget's with findings\").",
        "Results/Findings": "The mean ages for the Paget's alone and with findings groups were 63.6 and 49.6 years, respectively.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "LIBRETTO-001 is an ongoing phase 1/2, single-group, open-label, basket trial of selpercatinib in patients aged 18 years and older (or ≥12 years, where permitted by regulatory authorities) with RET-altered cancers. The trial is being conducted at 89 sites in 16 countries; the tumour-agnostic population was enrolled at 30 sites (outpatient and inpatient medical facilities) across eight countries. A prespecified interim analysis of LIBRETTO-001 was planned to investigate the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in a tumour-agnostic population of patients with RET fusion-positive advanced solid tumours; the data cutoff date was Sept 24, 2021. Eligible patients had disease progression on or after previous systemic therapies or no satisfactory therapeutic options and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Selpercatinib was orally administered in a continuous 28-day cycle. Patients enrolled in the phase 1 dose-escalation portion received between 20 mg once daily or 20-240 mg twice daily; the phase 2 recommended dose was 160 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate as determined by the independent review committee. The efficacy-evaluable tumour-agnostic population was defined as patients with RET fusion-positive cancer, other than non-small-cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, who had at least 6 months of follow-up from the first study dose at the time of data cutoff (all responders at the time of data cutoff were followed up for at least 6 months from the onset of response unless they progressed or died earlier). Safety was analysed in the tumour-agnostic population of patients who had been enrolled and received selpercatinib on or before the data cutoff date. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and is still recruiting participants.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 4, 2017, and Aug 4, 2021, 45 patients with RET fusion-positive tumour-agnostic cancers were enrolled from the phase 1 dose-escalation and phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts of the trial. 43 (96%) of 45 patients received a starting dose of selpercatinib at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Of the two patients who did not, one received a dose of 160 mg twice daily via intra-patient dose escalation (as allowed per protocol for patients enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study at lower doses) and the other patient's starting dose of 120 mg twice daily was never escalated. Of the 41 efficacy-evaluable patients, the objective response rate as per the independent review committee was 43·9% (95% CI 28·5-60·3; 18 of 41 patients). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (ten [22%] of 45 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase (seven [16%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [13%]). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred in 18 (40%) of 45 patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Selpercatinib showed clinically meaningful activity in the RET fusion-positive tumour-agnostic population, with a safety profile consistent with that observed in other indications. Comprehensive genomic testing that includes RET fusions will be crucial for identifying patients who might benefit from selpercatinib.",

Premenopausal women and men also received goserelin every 28 days. Eligible patients had anatomical stage II or III breast cancer. Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of invasive disease-free survival, the primary end point; other efficacy and safety results are also reported. Invasive disease-free survival was evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Retrospective, single-institution review of all breast cancer patients between 1997 and 2002 presenting with an intact tumor and synchronous metastatic disease. Information collected included: demographics, tumor characteristics, metastatic sites, type/timing of surgery, and radiation/systemic therapy received. Patients initiated treatment within 3 months of their diagnosis. Patients were divided into three groups based on time interval from diagnosis date to surgery date. Disease progression and vital status at last follow-up were evaluated. Analysis of metastatic PFS (defined by progression of systemic disease) benefit in relation to surgical timing was performed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Multivariate analysis revealed patients having only one site of metastasis, negative margins, and Caucasian race had improved PFS. Further analysis revealed non-Caucasian patients more often underwent surgical intervention for palliation versus surgery for curative intent, possibly explaining their worse outcome. Patients who underwent surgery in the 3-8.9 month or later period had improved metastatic PFS.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Surgical extirpation of the primary tumor in patients with synchronous stage IV disease is associated with improved metastatic PFS when performed more than 3 months after diagnosis. Resection should be planned with the intent of obtaining negative margins.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "From 1996 to 1998, 67 consecutive patients with breast carcinoma underwent SSM with immediate reconstruction and were prospectively observed. From this group of patients, those with locally advanced disease (stage IIB, n = 12; stage III, n = 13) were analyzed separately. Tumor characteristics, adjuvant therapy, type of reconstruction, operative time, complications, hospital stay, and incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis were noted.",
        "Results/Findings": "Breast reconstruction consisted of a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (n = 22) or a latissimus flap plus an implant (n = 4). The median operative time was 5.5 hours; the average hospital stay was 5.2 days. Complications required reoperation in three patients (12%): partial skin flap necrosis in two and partial abdominal skin necrosis in one. Surgery on the opposite breast for symmetry was required in one patient (4%). Postoperative adjuvant therapy was not significantly delayed (median interval, 32 days). With a median length of follow-up of 49.2 months (range, 33-64 months), local recurrence was present in only one patient (4%), with successful local salvage treatment, and distant metastasis was present in four patients (16%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "SSM with immediate reconstruction seems safe and effective and has a low morbidity for patients with advanced stages of breast carcinoma. Local recurrence rates and the incidence of distant metastasis are not increased compared with those of patients who have had modified radical mastectomies without reconstruction.",

        "Methods": "We identified 5,405 patients who underwent surgery between 1997 and 2006. Patients undergoing MRI were identified from a prospective database. Trends in mastectomy rate and the association of MRI with surgery type were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the effect of surgery year and MRI on surgery type, while adjusting for potential confounding variables.",
        "Results/Findings": "Mastectomy rates differed significantly across time (P < .0001), and decreased from 45% in 1997% to 31% in 2003, followed by increasing rates for 2004 to 2006. The use of MRI increased from 10% in 2003% to 23% in 2006 (P < .0001). Patients with MRI were more likely to undergo mastectomy than those without MRI (54% v 36%; P < .0001). However, mastectomy rates increased from 2004 to 2006 predominantly among patients without MRI (29% in 2003% to 41% in 2006; P < .0001). In a multivariable model, both MRI (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; P < .0001) and surgical year (compared to 2003 OR: 1.4 for 2004, 1.8 for 2005, and 1.7 for 2006; P < .0001) were independent predictors of mastectomy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After a steady decline, mastectomy rates have increased in recent years with both surgery year and MRI as significant predictors for type of surgery. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of MRI and other factors influencing surgical planning.",

        "Methods": "Information was obtained regarding all women diagnosed in the state of California with stage I or II breast cancer between 1990 and 2004, who were treated with either BCT or mastectomy and followed for vital status through December 2009. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between BCT and mastectomy groups. Analyses were stratified by age group (< 50 years and ≥ 50 years) and tumor HR status.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 112,154 women fulfilled eligibility criteria. Women undergoing BCT had improved OS and DSS compared with women with mastectomy (adjusted hazard ratio for OS entire cohort = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-0.83). The DSS benefit with BCT compared with mastectomy was greater among women age ≥ 50 with HR-positive disease (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.91) than among women age < 50 with HR-negative disease (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98); however, this trend was seen among all subgroups analyzed.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with early stage breast cancer, BCT was associated with improved DSS. These data provide confidence that BCT remains an effective alternative to mastectomy for early stage disease regardless of age or HR status.",

        "Methods": "After lumpectomy and axillary dissection, patients with stage I or II breast cancer received 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast in 2-Gy fractions over a five-week period. Patients with a microscopically complete excision were randomly assigned to receive either no further local treatment (2657 patients) or an additional localized dose of 16 Gy, usually given in eight fractions by means of an external electron beam (2661 patients).",
        "Results/Findings": "During a median follow-up period of 5.1 years, local recurrences were observed in 182 of the 2657 patients in the standard-treatment group and 109 of the 2661 patients in the additional-radiation group. The five-year actuarial rates of local recurrence were 7.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 7.6 percent) and 4.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 4.7 percent), respectively (P<0.001), yielding a hazard ratio for local recurrence of 0.59 (99 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81) associated with an additional dose. Patients 40 years old or younger benefited most; at five years, their rate of local recurrence was 19.5 percent with standard treatment and 10.2 percent with additional radiation (hazard ratio, 0.46 [99 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.89]; P=0.002). At five years in the age group 41 to 50 years old, no differences were found in rates of metastasis or overall survival (which were 87 and 91 percent, respectively).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In patients with early breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery and receive 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast, an additional dose of 16 Gy of radiation to the tumor bed reduces the risk of local recurrence, especially in patients younger than 50 years of age.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was performed to identify patients with DCIS diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 and treated with BCS by using SEER data. Patients were divided into the following two groups: BCS+RT (RT group) and BCS alone (non-RT group). We used a patient prognostic scoring model to stratify patients on the basis of risk of local recurrence. We performed a Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score weighting to evaluate breast cancer mortality between the two groups.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 32,144 eligible patients with DCIS, 20,329 (63%) in the RT group and 11,815 (37%) in the non-RT group. Overall, 304 breast cancer-specific deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 96 months, with a cumulative incidence of breast cancer mortality at 10 years in the weighted cohorts of 1.8% (RT group) and 2.1% (non-RT group; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.88). Significant improvements in survival in the RT group compared with the non-RT group were only observed in patients with higher nuclear grade, younger age, and larger tumor size. The magnitude of the survival difference with RT was significantly correlated with prognostic score (P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this population-based study, the patient prognostic score for DCIS is associated with the magnitude of improvement in survival offered by RT after BCS, suggesting that decisions for RT could be tailored on the basis of patient factors, tumor biology, and the prognostic score.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modern aromatase inhibitors.",
        "Results/Findings": "Allocation to about 6 months of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC) reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38% (SE 5) for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by about 20% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed, largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0.0001 for recurrence, 2p<0.00001 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than CMF chemotherapy. Few women of age 70 years or older entered these chemotherapy trials. For ER-positive disease only, allocation to about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31% (SE 3), largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50, 50-69, > or =70 years), progesterone receptor status, or other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly (2p<0.00001 for recurrence, 2p=0.01 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses: anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women); CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14,000); anthracycline-based versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14,000); about 5 years of tamoxifen versus none (15,000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen versus none (33,000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of tamoxifen (18,000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of 38% (age <50 years) and 20% (age 50-69 years) from such chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31% from tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality reductions would be 57% and 45%, respectively (and, the trial results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival would be comparably improved, since these treatments have relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all other causes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Some of the widely practicable adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s, which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further improvements in long-term survival could well be available from newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.",

After definitive surgery, the patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were a pathological complete response at the time of definitive surgery and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.",
        "Results/Findings": "At the first interim analysis, among the first 602 patients who underwent randomization, the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 64.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.9 to 69.5) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 51.2% (95% CI, 44.1 to 58.3) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (estimated treatment difference, 13.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.4 to 21.8; P<0.001). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2.7 to 25.0), 58 of 784 patients (7.4%) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 46 of 390 patients (11.8%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group had disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, had local or distant recurrence or a second primary tumor, or died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.93). Across all treatment phases, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 78.0% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 73.0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% (3 patients) and 0.3% (1 patient), respectively.",

The primary end point was change in photographic breast appearance at 2 and 5 years; secondary end points were physician assessments of NTE and local tumor control. Odds ratios (ORs) from longitudinal analyses compared regimens.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 915 women were recruited from 18 UK centers (2004-2007). Five-year photographs were available for 615/862 (71%) eligible patients. ORs for change in photographic breast appearance were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.49;   = .019) for 30 Gy and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.71;   = .686) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. α/β estimate for photographic end point was 2.7 Gy (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.9 Gy), giving a 5-fr schedule of 28 Gy (95% CI, 26 to 30 Gy) estimated to be isoeffective with 50 Gy/25 fr. ORs for any moderate/marked physician-assessed breast NTE (shrinkage, induration, telangiectasia, edema) were 2.12 (95% CI, 1.55 to 2.89;   < .001) for 30 Gy and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.72;   = .248) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. With 9.9 years median follow-up, 11 ipsilateral breast cancer events (50 Gy: 3; 30 Gy: 4; 28.5 Gy: 4) and 96 deaths (50 Gy: 30; 30 Gy: 33; 28.5 Gy: 33) have occurred.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "At 10 years, there was no significant difference in NTE rates after 28.5 Gy/5 fr compared with 50 Gy/25 fr, but NTE were higher after 30 Gy/5 fr. Results confirm the published 3-year findings that a once-weekly 5-fr schedule of whole-breast radiotherapy can be identified that appears to be radiobiologically comparable for NTE to a conventionally fractionated regimen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In this pooled analysis, 12 institutes and trials in Europe and the USA were identified by personal communications with site investigators. We obtained participant-level RCB results, and data on clinical and pathological stage, tumour subtype and grade, and treatment and follow-up in November, 2019, from patients (aged ≥18 years) with primary stage I-III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. We assessed the association between the continuous RCB score and the primary study outcome, event-free survival, using mixed-effects Cox models with the incorporation of random RCB and cohort effects to account for between-study heterogeneity, and stratification to account for differences in baseline hazard across cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor status and HER2 status. The association was further evaluated within each breast cancer subtype in multivariable analyses incorporating random RCB and cohort effects and adjustments for age and pretreatment clinical T category, nodal status, and tumour grade. Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free survival at 3, 5, and 10 years were computed for each RCB class within each subtype.",
        "Results/Findings": "We analysed participant-level data from 5161 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy between Sept 12, 1994, and Feb 11, 2019. Median age was 49 years (IQR 20-80). 1164 event-free survival events occurred during follow-up (median follow-up 56 months [IQR 0-186]). RCB score was prognostic within each breast cancer subtype, with higher RCB score significantly associated with worse event-free survival. The univariable hazard ratio (HR) associated with one unit increase in RCB ranged from 1·55 (95% CI 1·41-1·71) for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative patients to 2·16 (1·79-2·61) for the hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive group (with or without HER2-targeted therapy; p<0·0001 for all subtypes). RCB score remained prognostic for event-free survival in multivariable models adjusted for age, grade, T category, and nodal status at baseline: the adjusted HR ranged from 1·52 (1·36-1·69) in the hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative group to 2·09 (1·73-2·53) in the hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive group (p<0·0001 for all subtypes).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "RCB score and class were independently prognostic in all subtypes of breast cancer, and generalisable to multiple practice settings. Although variability in hormone receptor subtype definitions and treatment across patients are likely to affect prognostic performance, the association we observed between RCB and a patient's residual risk suggests that prospective evaluation of RCB could be considered to become part of standard pathology reporting after neoadjuvant therapy.",

        "Methods": "This was an open-label, single-group, phase 2 study. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years; had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less; HER2-amplified early stage breast cancer; operable, histologically confirmed, invasive carcinoma of the breast; adequate tumour specimen available for FISH analysis of TOP2A status; and adequate haematological, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. Patients received four 21-day cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), plus intravenous cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), plus intravenous trastuzumab 4 mg/kg (loading dose) on day 1 and 2 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 during chemotherapy, followed by trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every three weeks for the remainder of 1 year. The primary endpoint was 2-year DFS in TOP2A-amplified and TOP2A-non-amplified patients; the primary analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "493 patients were enrolled between June 15, 2007, and Aug 5, 2009. After a median follow-up of 36·1 months (IQR 35·5-36·7), 2-year DFS was 97·8% (95% CI 94·2-99·2) and 2-year overall survival was 99·5% (95% CI 96·2-99·9) for the 190 patients with TOP2A-amplified disease; 2-year DFS was 97·9% (95% CI 94·9-99·1) and 2-year overall survival was 98·8% (95% CI 96·2-99·6) for the 248 patients with TOP2A-non-amplified disease; 55 patients were not assessable for TOP2A status. In the 486 patients who received at least one dose of study drug, the most common adverse events of any grade were fatigue (284 patients, 58·4%), neutropenia (250, 51·4%), and nausea (217, 44·7%). The most common grade 3-4 toxic effects were neutropenia (229, 47·1%), febrile neutropenia (30, 6·2%), fatigue (21, 4·3%), and diarrhoea (16, 3·3%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 29 (6·0%) patients (12 [2·5%] grade 1, 15 [3·1%] grade 2, and two [0·4%] grade 3). 23 patients had at least one study-related serious adverse event. 16 patients stopped trastuzumab because of cardiac dysfunction.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A short, four-cycle regimen of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide combined with trastuzumab could be an option for adjuvant treatment of women with lower risk HER2-amplified early breast cancer, irrespective of TOP2A status.",

        "Methods": "Eight thousand twenty-eight postmenopausal women with receptor-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned (double-blind) between March 1998 and May 2003 to receive 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole, tamoxifen, or a sequence of these agents. Seven thousand nine hundred sixty-three patients who actually received therapy are included in this safety analysis, which focuses on cardiovascular events. AE recording ceased 30 days after therapy completion (or after switch on the sequential arms).",
        "Results/Findings": "Baseline comorbidities were balanced. At a median follow-up time of 30.1 months, we observed similar overall incidence of cardiac AEs (letrozole, 4.8%; tamoxifen, 4.7%), more grade 3 to 5 cardiac AEs on letrozole (letrozole, 2.4%; tamoxifen, 1.4%; P = .001)--an excess only partially attributable to prior hypercholesterolemia--and more overall (tamoxifen, 3.9%; letrozole, 1.7%; P < .001) and grade 3 to 5 thromboembolic AEs on tamoxifen (tamoxifen, 2.3%; letrozole, 0.9%; P < .001). There was no significant difference between tamoxifen and letrozole in incidence of hypertension or cerebrovascular events.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical stage II to III ER-positive (Allred score 6-8) breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary end point was clinical response. Secondary end points included BCS, Ki67 proliferation marker changes, the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI), and PAM50-based intrinsic subtype analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI score, or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. PAM50 analysis identified AI-unresponsive nonluminal subtypes (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 enriched or basal-like) in 3.3% of patients. Clinical response and surgical outcomes were similar in luminal A (LumA) versus luminal B tumors; however, a PEPI of 0 (best prognostic group) was highest in the LumA subset (27.1% v 10.7%; P = .004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neoadjuvant AI treatment markedly improved surgical outcomes. Ki67 and PEPI data demonstrated that the three agents tested are biologically equivalent and therefore likely to have similar adjuvant activities. LumA tumors were more likely to have favorable biomarker characteristics after treatment; however, occasional paradoxical increases in Ki67 (12% of tumors with > 5% increase after therapy) suggest treatment-resistant cells, present in some LumA tumors, can be detected by post-treatment profiling.",

        "Methods": "A nested prospective cohort study was conducted in women aged <40 years with breast cancer (BC) who were undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 26). Serum MIS, FSH, and E2 were measured before chemotherapy (baseline) and at Weeks 6, 12, 36, and 52. Controls were 134 age-matched women with known fertility. Hormone levels were compared between the cases and controls at baseline. Differences between amenorrhea and age subgroups were tested using the nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample test using a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.",
        "Results/Findings": "Subjects with BC and age-matched controls had similar baseline MIS levels (median, 0.94 ng/mL vs 0.86 ng/mL;, P > .05). Serum MIS decreased significantly at 6 weeks and remained suppressed for 52 weeks. E2 levels decreased, and FSH levels increased during chemotherapy; however, at 52 weeks, the levels returned to baseline. At 52 weeks, only 1 patient had MIS above the lower normal range, 15 had return of menstrual function, 11 had premenopausal levels of FSH, and 13 had follicular phase levels of E2. In women aged <35 years, 25% remained amenorrheic, whereas in women aged >35 years, 50% were amenorrheic. Amenorrheic and menstruating women were found to have similar MIS values at baseline and follow-up.",

        "Methods": "Patients with previously untreated, non-metastatic, stage II-III, triple-negative breast cancer and HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were treated for 18 weeks with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) once a week) and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (20 mg/m(2) once a week). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer received simultaneous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). Patients with HER2-positive disease received simultaneous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg initial dose with subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) and lapatinib (750 mg daily). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with dynamic allocation and minimisation, stratified by biological subtype and Ki-67 level to receive, at the same time as the backbone regimens, either carboplatin (AUC 1·5 [2·0 for the first 329 patients] once a week) or no carboplatin.

In this final analysis, 129 patients (43·7%, 95% CI 38·1-49·4) in the carboplatin group achieved a pathological complete response, compared with 108 patients (36·9%, 31·3-42·4) without carboplatin (odds ratio 1·33, 95% CI 0·96-1·85; p=0·107). Of the patients with triple-negative breast cancer, 84 (53·2%, 54·4-60·9) of 158 patients achieved a pathological complete response with carboplatin, compared with 58 (36·9%, 29·4-44·5) of 157 without (p=0·005). Of the patients with HER2-positive tumours, 45 (32·8%, 25·0-40·7) of 137 patients achieved a pathological complete response with carboplatin compared with 50 (36·8%, 28·7-44·9) of 136 without (p=0·581; test for interaction p=0·015). Haematological and non-haematological toxic effects that were significantly more common in the carboplatin group than in the no-carboplatin group included grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (192 [65%] vs 79 [27%]), grade 3 or 4 anaemia (45 [15%] vs one [<1%]), grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (42 [14%] vs one [<1%]), and grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (51 [17%] vs 32 [11%]); carboplatin was more often associated with dose discontinuations (141 [48%] with carboplatin and 114 [39%] without carboplatin; p=0·031). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 haematological events decreased from 82% (n=135) to 70% (n=92) and grade 3 or 4 non-haematological events from 78% (n=128) to 59% (n=77) in the carboplatin arm when the dose of carboplatin was reduced from AUC 2·0 to 1·5.",

        "Results/Findings": "Antibiotics were given to treat clinical infection in 68 of 413 expanders (16.5 percent), with a median time to diagnosis of 6.5 weeks (range, 1 to 52 weeks). Univariable analysis showed significant association with breast size larger than C cup (p < 0.001), previous irradiation (p = 0.007), repeated implant (p = 0.008), and delayed reconstruction (p = 0.04). All variables except delayed reconstruction remained significant (p < 0.002 for all) in a multivariable model. Additional significant covariates in this model included one surgical oncologist (p = 0.003) and contralateral surgery (p = 0.046). Given infection, one surgical oncologist was associated with an increased rate of mastectomy flap necrosis (p = 0.01).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Certain patient characteristics are associated with increased infection in tissue expansion breast reconstruction. Understanding how these predispose to infection requires additional study. Patients identified with these characteristics should be educated about these risks and other reconstructive options to optimize the success of their breast reconstruction.",

        "Results/Findings": "Baseline disease characteristics and treatment histories among the elderly subsets (≥ 65 years, n = 275; ≥ 70 years, n = 164) were generally comparable with younger patients. The addition of EVE to EXE improved PFS regardless of age (hazard ratio, 0.59 [≥ 65 years] and 0.45 [≥ 70 years]). Adverse events (AEs) of special interest (all grades) that occurred more frequently with EVE than with PBO included stomatitis, infections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We did a meta-analysis of individual data for 8135 women randomly assigned to treatment groups during 1964-86 in 22 trials of radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes after mastectomy and axillary surgery versus the same surgery but no radiotherapy. Follow-up lasted 10 years for recurrence and to Jan 1, 2009, for mortality. Analyses were stratified by trial, individual follow-up year, age at entry, and pathological nodal status.",
        "Results/Findings": "3786 women had axillary dissection to at least level II and had zero, one to three, or four or more positive nodes. All were in trials in which radiotherapy included the chest wall, supraclavicular or axillary fossa (or both), and internal mammary chain. For 700 women with axillary dissection and no positive nodes, radiotherapy had no significant effect on locoregional recurrence (two-sided significance level [2p]>0·1), overall recurrence (rate ratio [RR], irradiated vs not, 1·06, 95% CI 0·76-1·48, 2p>0·1), or breast cancer mortality (RR 1·18, 95% CI 0·89-1·55, 2p>0·1). For 1314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·57-0·82, 2p=0·00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·67-0·95, 2p=0·01). 1133 of these 1314 women were in trials in which systemic therapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, or tamoxifen) was given in both trial groups and, for them, radiotherapy again reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·55-0·82, 2p=0·00009), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·78, 95% CI 0·64-0·94, 2p=0·01). For 1772 women with axillary dissection and four or more positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·69-0·90, 2p=0·0003), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·77-0·99, 2p=0·04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After mastectomy and axillary dissection, radiotherapy reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the women with one to three positive lymph nodes in these trials even when systemic therapy was given. For today's women, who in many countries are at lower risk of recurrence, absolute gains might be smaller but proportional gains might be larger because of more effective radiotherapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Between 1982 and 1990, postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer (stage II or III) were randomly assigned adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) alone (689) or with postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (686). Median follow-up was 123 months. The endpoints were first site of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or both), and disease-free and overall survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "Locoregional recurrence occurred in 52 (8%) of the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 242 (35%) of the tamoxifen only group (p<0.001). In total there were 321 (47%) and 411 (60%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24% in the tamoxifen alone group (p<0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36% at 10 years, p=0.03).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control.",

Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to 1 year of oral olaparib or placebo. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1836 patients underwent randomization. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 85.9% in the olaparib group and 77.1% in the placebo group (difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 13.0; hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.82; P<0.001).

Olaparib was associated with fewer deaths than placebo (59 and 86, respectively) (hazard ratio, 0.68; 99% CI, 0.44 to 1.05; P = 0.02); however, the between-group difference was not significant at an interim-analysis boundary of a P value of less than 0.01. Safety data were consistent with known side effects of olaparib, with no excess serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with high-risk, HER2-negative early breast cancer and germline   or   pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, adjuvant olaparib after completion of local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer survival free of invasive or distant disease than was placebo.

In patients undergoing SLND and ALND (n = 118), the FNR was 10.1% (95% CI, 4.2 to 19.8), which included seven false-negative events in 69 patients with residual disease. Adding evaluation of the clipped node reduced the FNR to 1.4% (95% CI, 0.03 to 7.3; P = .03). The clipped node was not retrieved as an SLN in 23% (31 of 134) of patients, including six with negative SLNs but metastasis in the clipped node.

        "Methods": "In the ongoing multicentre single-arm phase IIIb PERUSE study, patients with inoperable HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (locally recurrent/metastatic) (LR/MBC) and no prior systemic therapy for LR/MBC (except endocrine therapy) received docetaxel, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel with trastuzumab [8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w)] and pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg q3w) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, 1436 patients received at least one treatment dose (initially docetaxel in 775 patients, paclitaxel in 589, nab-paclitaxel in 65; 7 discontinued before starting taxane). Median age was 54 years; 29% had received prior trastuzumab. Median treatment duration was 16 months for pertuzumab and trastuzumab and 4 months for taxane. Compared with docetaxel-containing therapy, paclitaxel-containing therapy was associated with more neuropathy (all-grade peripheral neuropathy 31% versus 16%) but less febrile neutropenia (1% versus 11%) and mucositis (14% versus 25%). At this preliminary analysis (52 months' median follow-up), median PFS was 20.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 18.9-22.7] months overall (19.6, 23.0 and 18.1 months with docetaxel, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel, respectively). ORR was 80% (95% CI 78%-82%) overall (docetaxel 79%, paclitaxel 83%, nab-paclitaxel 77%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Preliminary findings from PERUSE suggest that the safety and efficacy of first-line pertuzumab, trastuzumab and taxane for HER2-positive LR/MBC are consistent with results from CLEOPATRA. Paclitaxel appears to be a valid alternative taxane backbone to docetaxel, offering similar PFS and ORR with a predictable safety profile.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial, done in 209 sites in 29 countries, we randomly assigned patients 2:1 with untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using a block method (block size of six) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel; paclitaxel; or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by type of on-study chemotherapy (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 expression at baseline (combined positive score [CPS] ≥1 or <1), and previous treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (yes or no). Eligibility criteria included age at least 18 years, centrally confirmed triple-negative breast cancer; at least one measurable lesion; provision of a newly obtained tumour sample for determination of triple-negative breast cancer status and PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 0 or 1; and adequate organ function. The sponsor, investigators, other study site staff (except for the unmasked pharmacist), and patients were masked to pembrolizumab versus saline placebo administration. In addition, the sponsor, the investigators, other study site staff, and patients were masked to patient-level tumour PD-L1 biomarker results. Dual primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival assessed in the PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, CPS of 1 or more, and intention-to-treat populations. The definitive assessment of progression-free survival was done at this interim analysis; follow-up to assess overall survival is continuing. For progression-free survival, a hierarchical testing strategy was used, such that testing was done first in patients with CPS of 10 or more (prespecified statistical criterion was α=0·00411 at this interim analysis), then in patients with CPS of 1 or more (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis, with partial alpha from progression-free survival in patients with CPS of 10 or more passed over), and finally in the intention-to-treat population (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 9, 2017, and June 12, 2018, of 1372 patients screened, 847 were randomly assigned to treatment, with 566 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 281 patients in the placebo-chemotherapy group. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff, Dec 11, 2019), median follow-up was 25·9 months (IQR 22·8-29·9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 26·3 months (22·7-29·7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Among patients with CPS of 10 or more, median progression-free survival was 9·7 months with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy and 5·6 months with placebo-chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for progression or death, 0·65, 95% CI 0·49-0·86; one-sided p=0·0012 [primary objective met]). Median progression-free survival was 7·6 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·74, 0·61-0·90; one-sided p=0·0014 [not significant]) among patients with CPS of 1 or more and 7·5 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·82, 0·69-0·97 [not tested]) among the intention-to-treat population. The pembrolizumab treatment effect increased with PD-L1 enrichment. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event rates were 68% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 67% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in <1% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus placebo-chemotherapy among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with CPS of 10 or more.

Concentration-time profiles were simulated using the established population pharmacokinetic model of pembrolizumab based on 2993 subjects from five clinical trials across tumour types. Efficacy was bridged by evaluating projections of average concentration over the dosing interval (C ) and trough concentration (C ) at steady state ( ). Safety was bridged by ensuring that concentrations were below those at 10 mg/kg dose every 2 weeks (Q2W), the maximum clinical dose.",
        "Results/Findings": "The 400 mg Q6W dose had similar predicted exposure (C , geometric mean ∼1% higher) as the 200 mg Q3W dose. Fewer than 1% of subjects had transiently lower C  than that observed for 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W. Despite these reductions, similar target saturation is expected. The predicted peak concentrations (C ) for 400 mg Q6W were substantially (∼65%) lower than the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Exposures expected for pembrolizumab 400 mg Q6W were similar to the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W and below the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimens. Established exposure-response relationships for pembrolizumab over a 5-fold dose range (2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg Q2W) support that clinical efficacy and safety of 400 mg Q6W would be similar to the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W doses across tumour types.",

At a median follow-up of 4·9 years (IQR 3·6-6 ·0), 24 (28%) patients had disease-free survival events in the chemotherapy group compared with 34 (44%) in the no chemotherapy group. 5-year disease-free survival was 69% (95% CI 56-79) with chemotherapy versus 57% (44-67) without chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0·59 [95% CI 0·35-0·99]; p=0·046). Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly more effective for women with oestrogen-receptor-negative ILRR (pinteraction=0·046), but analyses of disease-free survival according to the oestrogen-receptor status of the primary tumour were not statistically significant (pinteraction=0·43). Of the 81 patients who received chemotherapy, 12 (15%) had serious adverse events. The most common adverse events were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and intestinal infection.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Adjuvant chemotherapy should be recommended for patients with completely resected ILRR of breast cancer, especially if the recurrence is oestrogen-receptor negative.",

        "Methods": "Two hundred forty-four patients with stage I or II breast cancer who were at substantial risk for distant metastases were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week course of chemotherapy either before or after radiation therapy. All had had breast-conserving surgery. The median length of follow-up in surviving patients was 58 months (range, 10 to 124).",
        "Results/Findings": "The five-year actuarial rates of cancer recurrence at any site and of distant metastases in the radiotherapy-first group and the chemotherapy-first group were 38 percent and 31 percent (P = 0.17) and 36 percent and 25 percent (P = 0.05), respectively. Overall survival was 73 percent and 81 percent (P = 0.11), respectively. The five-year crude rates of first recurrence according to site in the radiotherapy-first and chemotherapy-first groups, respectively, were 5 percent and 14 percent for local recurrence and 32 percent and 20 percent for distant or regional recurrence or both. This difference in the pattern of recurrence was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07).",

        "Methods": "We evaluated the BRCAPRO and BOADICEA models in a population-based series of African American, Hispanic, and NHW breast cancer patients tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. We assessed model calibration by evaluating observed versus predicted mutations and attribute diagrams, and model discrimination using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves.",
        "Results/Findings": "Both models were well-calibrated within each racial/ethnic group, with some exceptions. BOADICEA overpredicted mutations in African Americans and older NHWs, and BRCAPRO underpredicted in Hispanics. In all racial/ethnic groups, the models overpredicted in cases whose personal and family histories indicated >80% probability of carriage. The two models showed similar discrimination in each racial/ethnic group, discriminating least well in Hispanics. For example, BRCAPRO's areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 83% (95% confidence interval, 63-93%) for NHWs, compared with 74% (59-85%) for African Americans and 58% (45-70%) for Hispanics.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The poor performance of the model for Hispanics may be due to model misspecification in this racial/ethnic group.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause).",
        "Results/Findings": "At the interim analysis, among 1486 randomly assigned patients (743 in the T-DM1 group and 743 in the trastuzumab group), invasive disease or death had occurred in 91 patients in the T-DM1 group (12.2%) and 165 patients in the trastuzumab group (22.2%). The estimated percentage of patients who were free of invasive disease at 3 years was 88.3% in the T-DM1 group and 77.0% in the trastuzumab group. Invasive disease-free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001). Distant recurrence as the first invasive-disease event occurred in 10.5% of patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.9% of those in the trastuzumab group.

To be eligible, studies had to meet three inclusion criteria: include at least 200 patients with primary breast cancer treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery; have available data for pathological complete response, EFS, and OS; and have a median follow-up of at least 3 years. We compared the three most commonly used definitions of pathological complete response--ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, and ypT0/is--for their association with EFS and OS in a responder analysis. We assessed the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS in various subgroups. Finally, we did a trial-level analysis to assess whether pathological complete response could be used as a surrogate endpoint for EFS or OS.",
        "Results/Findings": "We obtained data from 12 identified international trials and 11 955 patients were included in our responder analysis. Eradication of tumour from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0) was better associated with improved EFS (ypT0 ypN0: hazard ratio [HR] 0·44, 95% CI 0·39-0·51; ypT0/is ypN0: 0·48, 0·43-0·54) and OS (0·36, 0·30-0·44; 0·36, 0·31-0·42) than was tumour eradication from the breast alone (ypT0/is; EFS: HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·55-0·66; OS 0·51, 0·45-0·58). We used the ypT0/is ypN0 definition for all subsequent analyses. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcomes was strongest in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (EFS: HR 0·24, 95% CI 0·18-0·33; OS: 0·16, 0·11-0·25) and in those with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative tumours who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0·15, 0·09-0·27; OS: 0·08, 0·03, 0·22). In the trial-level analysis, we recorded little association between increases in frequency of pathological complete response and EFS (R(2)=0·03, 95% CI 0·00-0·25) and OS (R(2)=0·24, 0·00-0·70).",

Patients were evaluated monthly for 2 years for skeletal complications, which included pathologic fractures, need for radiation or surgery to treat bone complications, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Bone pain, analgesic use, bone biochemical markers, performance status, quality of life, radiologic response in bone, and survival were also evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "As in the first year of treatment, the proportion of patients with any skeletal complication was significantly less for the pamidronate than the placebo group at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months (P < .001). The proportions of patients with any pathologic fracture (i.e., vertebral and nonvertebral fractures), need for radiation or surgery to treat bone complications, and hypercalcemia were also statistically less for the pamidronate than the placebo group. The median time to the first skeletal complication was 13.9 months in the pamidronate-treated women and 7.0 months in the placebo group (P < .001). Long-term treatment did not result in any unexpected adverse events. Survival did not differ between the two groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The risk for osteolytic bone lesion complications in metastatic breast cancer was significantly decreased with monthly infusions of 90 mg of pamidronate, and this effect was maintained for at least 2 years.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In the prospective, randomized, phase III PALLAS trial, patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with adjuvant endocrine therapy or adjuvant endocrine therapy alone (for at least 5 years). The primary end point of the study was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS); secondary end points were invasive breast cancer-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, locoregional cancer-free survival, and overall survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 5,796 patients enrolled at 406 centers in 21 countries worldwide over 3 years, 5,761 were included in the intention-to-treat population. At the final protocol-defined analysis, at a median follow-up of 31 months, iDFS events occurred in 253 of 2,884 (8.8%) patients who received palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and in 263 of 2,877 (9.1%) patients who received endocrine therapy alone, with similar results between the two treatment groups (iDFS at 4 years: 84.2%   84.5%; hazard ratio, 0.96; CI, 0.81 to 1.14;   = .65). No significant differences were observed for secondary time-to-event end points, and subgroup analyses did not show any differences by subgroup. There were no new safety signals for palbociclib in this trial.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "At this final analysis of the PALLAS trial, the addition of adjuvant palbociclib to standard endocrine therapy did not improve outcomes over endocrine therapy alone in patients with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

        "Methods": "After institutional review board approval, a database review of patients with Paget's disease was conducted. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment including use of SLNB, and survival were reviewed. Patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed by using contingency table chi-square, pooled t tests, and log-rank tests for comparisons.",
        "Results/Findings": "Fifty-four patients with Paget's disease were identified and divided into 2 cohorts (18 no SLNB and 36 SLNB). The mean age was 66 years for the no-SLNB group and 60 years for the SLNB group (P = .17). Paget's disease only was present in 33%, Paget's disease + DCIS in 41%, and Paget's disease + invasive cancer in 26%. The mean invasive tumor size was 1.62 cm in the no-SLNB group and 1.59 cm in the SLNB group (P = .96). For invasive disease, ER/PR status was similar, but Her2 was more likely to be overexpressed in SLNB (P = .04). Surgery choice ranged from \"no surgery\" to lumpectomy to mastectomy. Axillary staging was performed in 45 of 54 patients, with 11% in both cohorts having nodal disease. A sentinel lymph node was identified in 97% of patients. Five-year overall and disease-free survival was 100% in the no-SLNB group and 88% in the SLNB group (P = .97) and 76% in the no-SLNB group and 84% in the SLNB group (P = .88), respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Paget's disease remains rare but should be treated similar to other \"breast cancer.\" SLNB should be performed to evaluate the axilla when invasive disease is identified or a mastectomy is planned.",

        "Methods": "The medical records of patients treated for PD at RPCI between 1963 and 1996 were reviewed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Eighty patients were treated in the period reviewed. The median follow up was 61 months. Sixty-eight of 80 patients had nipple changes consistent with PD including 30 who had an associated breast mass (group 1), and 38 who had no associated mass (group 2). Of the 68 patients with clinical PD, 58 (85%) were treated with mastectomy while the remainder were treated with some form of breast conserving therapy. Breast cancer (BC) was found in 56 of 68 patients (82%) with clinical PD, including 28 of 30 patients (93%) in group 1 and 28 of 38 patients (74%) in group 2. Breast cancer was centrally located (within 2 cm of the areolar margin) in 61% of patients, including 71% in group 1 and 50% in group 2. Of the 28 patients with an associated BC in group 1, 21 (75%) had invasive cancer, 6 (21%) had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 16 (57%) had pathologic axillary nodes. Of the 28 patients with an associated BC in group 2, 10 (36%) had invasive cancer, 18 (64%) had DCIS, and 6 (21%) had positive axillary nodes. The median survival was significantly shorter for group 1 (42 months) than for group 2 (126 months; p = 0.007).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Most patients with PD have an associated BC (82%) that was centrally located (61%). In those patients without an associated mass, a significant number (26% in this series) may not have an underlying BC and may be overtreated with mastectomy. On the other hand, a significant number of patients with PD and no associated breast mass will be found to have a peripherally located tumor (29% in this series). These non-central BC masses could potentially be missed by a wide local excision that includes the areolar complex.",

        "Results/Findings": "Study patients had advanced metastatic disease and had received extensive prior therapy. A blinded, independent response evaluation committee identified eight complete and 26 partial responses, for an objective response rate of 15% in the intent-to-treat population (95% confidence interval, 11% to 21%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months; the median duration of survival was 13 months. The most common adverse events, which occurred in approximately 40% of patients, were infusion-associated fever and/or chills that usually occurred only during the first infusion, and were of mild to moderate severity. These symptoms were treated successfully with acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine. The most clinically significant adverse event was cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 4.7% of patients. Only 1% of patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related adverse events.",

The impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease was determined by comparing the FDG PET interpretation at the time of the examination with findings from conventional imaging (CI) performed before FDG PET. FDG PET results were confirmed in nearly half (n = 61) of the patients by histopathology (n = 23) or follow-up imaging (n = 38; mean follow-up interval, 21.3 months).",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients were referred for FDG PET for the following reasons: evaluation of disease response or viability after therapy (n = 43 [35%]), local recurrence, with intent of aggressive local treatment (n = 39 [31%]), equivocal findings on CI (n = 25 [20%]), evaluation of disease extent in patients with known metastases (n = 13 [10%]), and elevated tumor markers with unknown disease site (n = 5 [4%]). Compared with CI findings, the extent of disease increased in 54 (43%), did not change in 41 (33%), and decreased in 30 (24%) of 125 patients using FDG PET. Results of FDG PET altered the therapeutic plan in 40 (32%), directly helped to support the therapeutic plan in 34 (27%), and did not change the plan devised before FDG PET in 51 (41%) of 125 patients. FDG PET altered therapy most frequently in the patients suspected of having locoregional recurrence and in those being evaluated for treatment response versus other referral categories (p = 0.04).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Ninety-five patients were randomized (2:1) to either intermittent oral capecitabine 1,255 mg/m2 twice daily (two weeks' treatment followed by a one-week rest period) or intravenous CMF (cyclophosphamide. methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) administered every three weeks.",
        "Results/Findings": "The overall response rate in the capecitabine group was 30% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 19%-43%), including three complete responses (5%). The response rate observed in the CMF group was 16% (95% CI: 5%-33%), with no complete responses. Median time to disease progression was 4.1 months with capecitabine and 3.0 months with CME. Survival was similar in the two treatment groups (median 19.6 months with capecitabine. 17.2 months with CMF). The safety profiles were different for capecitabine and CMF. However, both regimens were generally well tolerated and treatment interruption and/or dose modification was effective in managing toxicities associated with capecitabine. Alopecia and myelosuppression were rare in patients receiving capecitabine while diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome were more common. Treatment interruption and/or individual dose adjustment of capecitabine was required in 34% of patients and was generally effective in managing adverse events. Treatment was stopped owing to toxicity in 16% of patients in the capecitabine arm. The incidence of deaths during or within 28 days of stopping study treatment was 8% and 6% in the capecitabine and CMF arms, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "An oral, twice-daily regimen of capecitabine is effective and well tolerated when used as first-line chemotherapy in older patients (> or = 55 years) with advanced/metastatic breast cancer, and is suitable for outpatient therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "From September of 1998 through January of 2005, 31 women (median age, 61 years) were treated for 32 centrally located breast carcinomas by breast-conserving therapy. There were 27 invasive tumors (median size, 13.5 mm), and five patients had ductal carcinoma in situ (median size, 39.6 mm). One patient received chemotherapy preoperatively for tumor reduction. A total of 11 patients had a positive lymph-node status, and 21 patients had a free sentinel node.",
        "Results/Findings": "The various surgical techniques included a central lumpectomy with direct closure (n = 6), central lumpectomy with inverted T-closure (n = 2), a circumareolar, Benelli-type closure (n = 2), a modified Grisotti-flap closure (n = 9), and a mammaplasty-type closure with an inferiorly based pedicle (n = 13). In 27 patients, a contralateral procedure was undertaken (bilateral carcinoma or symmetrizing mammaplasty). Two patients required a secondary mastectomy because of ductal carcinoma in situ with positive surgical margins in the final histology. They were treated by immediate reconstruction with an implant and a pedicled myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap, respectively. In a median follow-up of 33.8 months, there were no local recurrences in the remaining breast or axilla, but two patients developed distant metastases.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast carcinoma of small size that occurs in a central location can be safely treated oncologically by breast conservation therapy. The use of various oncoplastic techniques yields very satisfactory aesthetic results.",

        "Results/Findings": "Certain conditions involving host factors and tumor biologic characteristics may have a negative impact on the success rate and accuracy of the procedure. The overall fraction of patients unsuitable or with multiple risk factors that may compromise the success of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, is very small. Nevertheless, these patients need to be successfully identified, appropriately advised and cautioned, and so do the surgeons that perform the procedure.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Thirty consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing oncoplastic surgery (group 1) and 30 patients undergoing standard quadrantectomy (group 2) were prospectively studied with regard to the stage of breast cancer, the surgical procedures performed, the volume of breast tissue excised, and the histopathology of the tumor specimen, with specific details on surgical margins.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients who underwent oncoplastic surgery (group 1) were younger (mean age, 48.73 years) than patients who had a classic quadrantectomy (group 2; mean age, 55.76 years; P = .022). The mean volume of the excised specimen in group 1 was 200.18 cm(3), compared with 117.55 cm(3) in group 2 (P = .016). Surgical margins were negative in 25 cases out of 30 in group 1 and 17 out of 30 in group 2 (P = .05). The average length of the surgical margin was 8.5 mm in group 1 and 6.5 mm in group 2, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .074).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Oncoplastic surgery adds to the oncological safety of breast-conserving treatment because a larger volume of breast tissue can be excised and a wider negative margin can be obtained. It is especially indicated for large tumors, for which standard breast-conserving treatment has a high probability of leaving positive margins.",

For larger resections (level II OPS), a mammoplasty technique is required.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We identified three elements that can be used for patient selection and for determination of the appropriate OPS technique: excision volume, tumor location, and glandular density. For level II techniques, we defined a quadrant per quadrant Atlas that offers a different mammoplasty for each quadrant of the breast.",

All patients had a physical examination, mammography, and MRI of the breast. Using a dedicated breast coil, MRI imaging was performed with and without gadolinium enhancement. Positive MRI scans were compared with histopathologic findings at the time of operation (n = 21).",
        "Results/Findings": "MRI identified the primary breast lesion in 28 of 40 women (70%). Of these 28 patients, 11 had MRM, 11 had lumpectomy/axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)/radiotherapy (XRT), 2 had ALND/XRT alone, and 4 had no local treatment secondary to stage IV disease. Two women initially treated with lumpectomy/ALND subsequently had mastectomy for positive margins. Of the women with positive MRI who had breast surgery, 21 of 22 (95%) had tumor within the surgical specimen. Twelve women had negative MRI of the breast. Five of these 12 underwent MRM, of whom 4 had no tumor in the mastectomy specimen. The remaining 7 patients had ALND and whole breast radiation (ALND/XRT) (n = 5), or were observed (n = 2).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We did this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 495 centres in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America. Eligible women (aged ≥18 years, or ≥20 years in Japan) had stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer and had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy up to 2 years before randomisation. Inclusion criteria were amended on Feb 25, 2010, to include patients with stage 2-3 HER2-positive breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab therapy up to 1 year previously. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral neratinib 240 mg per day or matching placebo. The randomisation sequence was generated with permuted blocks stratified by hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive [oestrogen or progesterone receptor-positive or both] vs hormone receptor-negative [oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative]), nodal status (0, 1-3, or ≥4), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system. Patients, investigators, and trial sponsors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival, as defined in the original protocol, at 2 years after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, we randomly assigned 2840 women to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). Median follow-up time was 24 months (IQR 20-25) in the neratinib group and 24 months (22-25) in the placebo group. At 2 year follow-up, 70 invasive disease-free survival events had occurred in patients in the neratinib group versus 109 events in those in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·50-0·91; p=0·0091). The 2-year invasive disease-free survival rate was 93·9% (95% CI 92·4-95·2) in the neratinib group and 91·6% (90·0-93·0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in patients in the neratinib group were diarrhoea (grade 3, n=561 [40%] and grade 4, n=1 [<1%] vs grade 3, n=23 [2%] in the placebo group), vomiting (grade 3, n=47 [3%] vs n=5 [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3, n=26 [2%] vs n=2 [<1%]). QT prolongation occurred in 49 (3%) patients given neratinib and 93 (7%) patients given placebo, and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (≥grade 2) in 19 (1%) and 15 (1%) patients, respectively. We recorded serious adverse events in 103 (7%) patients in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) patients in the placebo group. Seven (<1%) deaths (four patients in the neratinib group and three patients in the placebo group) unrelated to disease progression occurred after study drug discontinuation. The causes of death in the neratinib group were unknown (n=2), a second primary brain tumour (n=1), and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=1), and in the placebo group were a brain haemorrhage (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and gastric cancer (n=1). None of the deaths were attributed to study treatment in either group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neratinib for 12 months significantly improved 2-year invasive disease-free survival when given after chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy to women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the improvement in breast cancer outcome is maintained.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "102 patients (stage T2-T4ac) were included in the study after exclusion of ineligible patients. Primary end-point was clinical response at 3 and 6 months as measured by palpation. Secondary end-point was radiological response as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography and/or ultrasound. Linear mixed models (95% confidence interval (CI)) were used to compare changes in mean tumour size (in mm) between baseline, 3 and 6 months after the start of endocrine therapy. Conversion rates from mastectomy to breast conserving surgery (BCS) were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median age of all patients was 72 years (range 53-88). Overall response rate by clinical palpation was 64.5% in all patients with a final palpation measurement. Four patients had clinically progressive disease. 63 patients had both 3-month and >3-month palpation measurements. Overall response was 58.7% at 3 months and 68.3% at final palpation (>3 months). Mean tumour size by clinical palpation at T=0 was 39.1mm (95% CI 34.8-43.4mm), and decreased to 23.0mm (95% CI 18.7-27.2mm) and 16.7 mm (95% CI 12.6-20.8) at T=3 and T>3 months, respectively (p=0.001). Final radiological response rates at the end of treatment for MRI (n=37), ultrasound (n=77) and mammography (n=56) were 70.3%, 41.6% and 48.2%, respectively. Feasibility of BCS improved from 61.8% to 70.6% (McNemar p=0.012).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "6 months of neoadjuvant exemestane therapy helps reduce mean tumour size further in strongly ER-positive BC patients without significant side-effects compared to 3 months. Nevertheless, some patients still experience disease progression under exemestane. Feasibility of breast conservation rates improved by almost 10%.",

The NCDB is a joint project of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society and contains about 80% of the cancer cases in the United States. All women in the NCDB diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 2006 through 2011, who underwent definitive breast surgery and received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, excluding patients with distant metastases or T4 tumors, were included and rates of breast preservation were determined.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 354,204 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 59,063 (16.7%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This proportion steadily increased from 13.9% in 2006 to 20.5% in 2011 (p<0.001). Receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with larger tumor size (7% cT1, 25% cT2, and 58% cT3; p<0.001), more advanced nodal disease (11% cN0, 39% cN1-3; p<0.001), younger patient age (21%<50 years vs 14%>50 years; p<0.001), higher tumor grade (18% grade 3, 15% grade 2, vs 12% grade 1; p<0.001), and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (21% ER negative vs 15% ER postive; p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that when adjusted for the above variables, patients with tumors larger than 3 cm undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to receive breast preservation than those who opted for primary surgery (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 1.8).",

DFS conditional on being event free for 5 years also demonstrated a strong trend in favor of the preoperative group (HR = 0.81, P = .053). Protocol B-27 results demonstrated that the addition of T to AC did not significantly impact DFS or OS. Preoperative T added to AC significantly increased the proportion of patients having pathologic complete responses (pCRs) compared with preoperative AC alone (26% v 13%, respectively; P < .0001).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Postmenopausal women completing 5 years of tamoxifen treatment were randomly assigned to a planned 5 years of letrozole (n = 2593) or placebo (n = 2594). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, incidence of contralateral tumors, and toxic effects. Survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. Planned subgroup analyses included those by axillary lymph node status. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "After a median follow-up of 30 months (range = 1.5-61.4 months), women in the letrozole arm had statistically significantly better DFS and distant DFS than women in the placebo arm (DFS: hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or contralateral breast cancer = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.45 to 0.76; P < .001; distant DFS: HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.84; P = .002). Overall survival was the same in both arms (HR for death from any cause = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.19; P = .3). However, among lymph node-positive patients, overall survival was statistically significantly improved with letrozole (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.98; P = .04). The incidence of contralateral breast cancer was lower in women receiving letrozole, but the difference was not statistically significant. Women receiving letrozole experienced more hormonally related side effects than those receiving placebo, but the incidences of bone fractures and cardiovascular events were the same.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Letrozole after tamoxifen is well-tolerated and improves both disease-free and distant disease-free survival but not overall survival, except in node-positive patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "All 458 women with a primary DCIS diagnosed between 1986 and 2004, in Uppland and Västmanland, Sweden were included. TMA blocks were constructed. To classify the DCIS tumors, we used immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (estrogen-, progesterone-, HER2, cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor) as a surrogate for the gene expression profiling. The association with prognosis was examined for basal-like DCIS and other subtypes using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression models.",
        "Results/Findings": "IHC data were complete for 392 women. Thirty-two were basal-like (8.2%), 351 were luminal or HER2-positive (89.5%) and 9 unclassified (2.3%). Seventy-six women had a local recurrence of which 34 were invasive. Another 3 women had general metastases as first event. Basal-like DCIS showed a higher risk of local recurrence and invasive recurrence 1.8 (Confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.8-4.2) and 1.9 (0.7-5.1), respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Also, no statistically significant increased risk was seen for triple-negative or high grade DCIS.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Basal-like DCIS showed about a doubled, however not statistically significant risk for local recurrence and developing invasive cancer compared with the other molecular subtypes. Molecular subtyping was a better prognostic parameter than histopathological grade.",

All men undergoing surgery for the treatment of invasive or in situ carcinoma of the breast were identified. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and surgical treatment options most frequently used for this population were described. In addition, the 30-day postoperative complication rates in the surgical treatment of male breast cancer were evaluated.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1773 MBC patients with a median age of 65 years (IQR 56-74 years) were included in this analysis. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.1 (IQR 25.4-33.8). In this study population, 177 (10.0%) had a diagnosis of in situ breast cancer, while the remaining 1596 (90.0%) had invasive disease. While most men underwent mastectomy, 282 (15.9%) had breast-conserving surgery. There were 74 (4.2%) patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In addition, 118 (6.7%) patients elected to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Overall, the rate of morbidity was 4.6%, comprising mostly of wound complications (3.2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Analysis of this large, prospective multi-institutional cohort revealed that complication rates are low and comparable to reported rates in the female breast cancer population. What is also significant about this analysis is that the cohort demonstrated the importance of cosmetic considerations in MBC patients, as some men decide to undergo breast-conserving surgery or immediate breast reconstruction. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in the treatment of MBC is also performed.",

        "Methods": "We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for MBC cases. That cohort was narrowed to cases of stage I-II, T1-T2N0 MBC with surgical and radiation therapy (RT) data available. The patients had undergone MRM, SM, or breast conservation surgery (BCS) with or without postoperative RT. We calculated the actuarial 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS).",

MRM without RT was the most common treatment (43%). Only 17% underwent BCS. Of the BCS patients, 46% received adjuvant RT to complete the traditional BCT. No deaths were recorded in the BCT group, regardless of stage, or in the 3 stage I surgical groups if the men had received RT. The actuarial 5-year CSS was 100% in each BCT group. MRM alone resulted in an actuarial 5-year CSS of 97.3% for stage 1% and 91.2% for stage 2.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The results from our study suggest that BCT for early-stage MBC yields comparable survival compared with more invasive treatment modalities (ie, MRM or SM alone).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients with follow-up and tumor samples, treated between 1990 and 2010, in 93 centers/9 countries. Samples were centrally analyzed in three laboratories (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 1822 patients enrolled, 1483 were analyzed; 63.5% were diagnosed between 2001 and 2010, 57 (5.1%) had metastatic disease (M1). Median age at diagnosis: 68.4 years. Of 1054 M0 cases, 56.2% were node-negative (N0) and 48.5% had T1 tumors; 4% had breast conserving surgery (BCS), 18% sentinel lymph-node biopsy; half received adjuvant radiotherapy; 29.8% (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and 76.8% adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), mostly tamoxifen (88.4%). Per central pathology, for M0 tumors: 84.8% ductal invasive carcinomas, 51.5% grade 2; 99.3% estrogen receptor (ER)-positive; 81.9% progesterone receptor (PR)-positive; 96.9% androgen receptor (AR)-positive [ER, PR or AR Allred score ≥3]; 61.1% Ki67 expression low (<14% positive cells); using immunohistochemistry (IHC) surrogates, 41.9% were Luminal-A-like, 48.6% Luminal-B-like/HER-2-negative, 8.7% HER-2-positive, 0.3% triple negative. Median follow-up: 8.2 years (0.0-23.8) for all, 7.2 years (0.0-23.2), for M0, 2.6 years (0.0-12.7) for M1 patients. A significant improvement over time was observed in age-corrected BC mortality. BC-specific-mortality was higher for men younger than 50 years. Better overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were observed for highly ER+ (P = 0.001), highly PR+ (P = 0.002), highly AR+ disease (P = 0.019). There was no association between OS/RFS and HER-2 status, Ki67, IHC subtypes nor grade.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Male BC is usually ER, PR and AR-positive, Luminal B-like/HER2-negative. Of note, 56% patients had T1 tumors but only 4% had BCS. ER was highly positive in >90% of cases but only 77% received adjuvant ET. ER, PR and AR were associated with OS and RFS, whereas grade, Ki67 and IHC surrogates were not. Significant improvement in survival over time was observed.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Twenty-six premenopausal non-pregnant patients who were candidates for LS underwent peritumoral injection of approximately 12 MBq of 99mTc-HSA nanocolloids. Static [15 min and 16 h post-injection (p.i.)] and whole-body (16 h p.i.) scintigraphic images were acquired. Activity concentration in the urine (0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16 h p.i.) was evaluated by a gamma-counter. Activity in the bloodstream was measured at 4 and 16 h p.i. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed, before tracer injection, on the injection site, between injection site and epigastrium (two points), and on the epigastrium, umbilicus and hypogastrium, and were removed before surgery.",
        "Results/Findings": "Scintigraphic images showed no radiotracer concentration except in the injection site and in the sentinel node. In all patients, the total activity excreted within the first 16 h was <2% of the injected activity. Activity in the blood pool was, at each time point, <1% of the injected activity. In 23 of 26 patients, all absorbed dose measurements were lower than the sensitivity of the TLD (<10 microGy); in the remaining three patients, the absorbed doses at the level of epigastrium, umbilicus and hypogastrium were in the following ranges: 40-320, 120-250 and 30-140 microGy, respectively.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "According to our standard technique (12 MBq of 99mTc-HAS), LS and SLNB can be performed safely during pregnancy, since the very low prenatal doses from this diagnostic procedure, when properly performed, do not significantly increase the risk of prenatal death, malformation or mental impairment.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In the United States, the populations primarily affected by lymphedema are patients undergoing treatment of malignancy, particularly women treated for breast cancer. A thorough evaluation of patients presenting with extremity swelling should include identification of prior surgical or radiation therapy for malignancy, as well as documentation of other risk factors for lymphedema, such as prior trauma to or infection of the affected limb. Physical examination should focus on differentiating signs of lymphedema from other causes of systemic or localized swelling. Lymphatic dysfunction can be visualized through lymphoscintigraphy; the diagnosis of lymphedema can also be confirmed through other imaging modalities, including CT or MRI. The mainstay of therapy in diagnosed cases of lymphedema involves compression garment use, as well as intensive bandaging and lymphatic massage. For patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy, several surgical options with varied proven efficacies have been used in appropriate candidates, including excisional approaches, microsurgical lymphatic anastomoses, and circumferential suction-assisted lipectomy, an approach that has shown promise for long-term relief of symptoms.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done in 30 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Women aged 50 years or older who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for unifocal invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of grade 1-3, with a tumour size of 3 cm or less (pT1-2), none to three positive axillary nodes (pN0-1), and minimum microscopic margins of non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy and 40 Gy to the partial breast (reduced-dose group), or 40 Gy to the partial breast only (partial-breast group) in 15 daily treatment fractions. Computer-generated random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were used to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by radiotherapy treatment centre. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. Field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered using standard tangential beams that were simply reduced in length for the partial-breast group. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local relapse (80% power to exclude a 2·5% increase [non-inferiority margin] at 5 years for each experimental group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the local relapse hazard ratio [HR] was less than 2·03), analysed by intention to treat. Safety analyses were done in all patients for whom data was available (ie, a modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN12852634.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 women were recruited. Two women withdrew consent for use of their data in the analysis. 674 patients were analysed in the whole-breast radiotherapy (control) group, 673 in the reduced-dose group, and 669 in the partial-breast group. Median follow-up was 72·2 months (IQR 61·7-83·2), and 5-year estimates of local relapse cumulative incidence were 1·1% (95% CI 0·5-2·3) of patients in the control group, 0·2% (0·02-1·2) in the reduced-dose group, and 0·5% (0·2-1·4) in the partial-breast group. Estimated 5-year absolute differences in local relapse compared with the control group were -0·73% (-0·99 to 0·22) for the reduced-dose and -0·38% (-0·84 to 0·90) for the partial-breast groups. Non-inferiority can be claimed for both reduced-dose and partial-breast radiotherapy, and was confirmed by the test against the critical HR being more than 2·03 (p=0·003 for the reduced-dose group and p=0·016 for the partial-breast group, compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy group). Photographic, patient, and clinical assessments recorded similar adverse effects after reduced-dose or partial-breast radiotherapy, including two patient domains achieving statistically significantly lower adverse effects (change in breast appearance [p=0·007 for partial-breast] and breast harder or firmer [p=0·002 for reduced-dose and p<0·0001 for partial-breast]) compared with whole-breast radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We showed non-inferiority of partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy compared with the standard whole-breast radiotherapy in terms of local relapse in a cohort of patients with early breast cancer, and equivalent or fewer late normal-tissue adverse effects were seen. This simple radiotherapy technique is implementable in radiotherapy centres worldwide.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "This study accrued all patients from January of 2004 through April of 2008 undergoing two-stage immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction using acellular human dermis. A total of 153 expanders were placed. Complications were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling was performed. Comparison of complication rates using the traditional (non-acellular human dermis) technique from concurrent (2004 to 2008) and consecutive time periods (2001 to 2003) for 2910 and 1170 expanders, respectively, is provided.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 153 expanders were implanted in 96 women: 39 unilateral and 57 bilateral. Eleven (7.2 percent) were removed due to infection (n = 5, 3.3 percent), exposure (n = 4, 2.6 percent), or patient preference (n = 2, 1.3 percent). Other complications included cellulitis (3.9 percent), seroma (7.2 percent), hematoma (2.0 percent), mastectomy flap necrosis (4.6 percent), and leak/failed expansion (0.0 percent); 92.8 percent were successfully expanded and exchanged for a permanent implant. Eleven seromas (7.2 percent) were identified; nine underwent aspiration. None of these resulted in infection or reconstructive failure. Univariate analysis revealed age, body mass index, axillary dissection, and postoperative chemotherapy to be associated with reconstructive failure (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that age, body mass index, and axillary dissection are independent risk factors for developing complications (p < 0.05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Acellular human dermis is a useful adjunct for intraoperative pocket development in immediate tissue expander reconstruction but can result in an increased risk of complications, in particular, seroma and reconstructive failure.",

The primary endpoint disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints time to recurrence (TTR), incidence of new contralateral breast cancer (CLBC), time to distant recurrence (TTDR), overall survival (OS), and death after recurrence were assessed in the total population (intention to treat; ITT: anastrozole, n=3125; tamoxifen, n=3116; total 6241) and the hormone-receptor-positive subpopulation, the clinically important subgroup for which endocrine treatment is now known to be effective (84% of ITT: anastrozole, n=2618; tamoxifen, n=2598; total 5216). After treatment completion, fractures and serious adverse events continued to be collected blindly (safety population: anastrozole, n=3092; tamoxifen, n=3094; total 6186). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN18233230.",
        "Results/Findings": "At a median follow-up of 100 months (range 0-126), DFS, TTR, TTDR, and CLBC were improved significantly in the ITT and hormone-receptor-positive populations. For hormone-receptor-positive patients: DFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.94), p=0.003; TTR HR 0.76 (0.67-0.87), p=0.0001; TTDR HR 0.84 (0.72-0.97), p=0.022; and CLBC HR 0.60 (0.42-0.85), p=0.004. Absolute differences in time to recurrence increased over time (TTR 2.8% [anastrozole 9.7%vs tamoxifen 12.5%] at 5 years and 4.8% [anastrozole 17.0%vs tamoxifen 21.8%] at 9 years) and recurrence rates remained significantly lower on anastrozole compared with tamoxifen after treatment completion (HR 0.75 [0.61-0.94], p=0.01). The fewer deaths after recurrence (anastrozole 245 vs tamoxifen 269) was not significant (HR 0.90 [0.75-1.07], p=0.2), and no effect was noted for OS (anastrozole 472 vs tamoxifen 477) HR 0.97 [0.86-1.11], p=0.7). Fracture rates were higher in patients receiving anastrozole than in those receiving tamoxifen during active treatment (number [annual rate]: 375 [2.93%] vs 234 [1.90%]; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.55 [1.31-1.83], p<0.0001), but were not different after treatment was completed (off treatment: 146 [1.56%] vs 143 [1.51%]; IRR 1.03 [0.81-1.31], p=0.79). We did not note any significant difference in risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality between anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment groups.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data show long-term safety findings and establish clearly the long-term efficacy of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen as initial adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive, early breast cancer, and provide statistically significant evidence of a larger carryover effect after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "MBC patients, who had experienced disease progression while receiving or within 4 months of taxane therapy (6 months if adjuvant taxane only), and who had a taxane as their last regimen, received ixabepilone (1- or 3-hour infusion of 50 mg/m(2) or 3-hour infusion of 40 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 49 patients treated with 40 mg/m(2) ixabepilone during 3 hours, 35 (73%) had experienced disease progression within 1 month of their last taxane dose. The response rate was 12% (95% CI, 4.7% to 26.5%). All responses (n = 6) were partial; five of six patients had not responded to prior taxane therapy. In responders, the median response duration was 10.4 months. In 20 patients (41%), stable disease was the best outcome. Median time to progression was 2.2 months (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2 months); median survival was 7.9 months. For treated patients across all cohorts (intent-to-treat population), the response rate was also 12% (eight of 66). Treatment-related adverse events in the study were manageable and primarily grade 1/2. Treatment-related neuropathy was mostly sensory and mild to moderate.",

        "Methods": "In the NSABP B-17 trial (accrual period: October 1, 1985, to December 31, 1990), patients with localized DCIS were randomly assigned to the lumpectomy only (LO, n = 403) group or to the lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy (LRT, n = 410) group. In the NSABP B-24 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (accrual period: May 9, 1991, to April 13, 1994), all accrued patients were randomly assigned to LRT+ placebo, (n=900) or LRT + tamoxifen (LRT + TAM, n = 899). Endpoints included I-IBTR, DCIS-IBTR, contralateral breast cancers (CBC), overall and breast cancer-specific survival, and survival after I-IBTR. Median follow-up was 207 months for the B-17 trial (N = 813 patients) and 163 months for the B-24 trial (N = 1799 patients).",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 490 IBTR events, 263 (53.7%) were invasive. Radiation reduced I-IBTR by 52% in the LRT group compared with LO (B-17, hazard ratio [HR] of risk of I-IBTR = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33 to 0.69, P < .001). LRT + TAM reduced I-IBTR by 32% compared with LRT + placebo (B-24, HR of risk of I-IBTR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.95, P = .025). The 15-year cumulative incidence of I-IBTR was 19.4% for LO, 8.9% for LRT (B-17), 10.0% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 8.5% for LRT + TAM. The 15-year cumulative incidence of all contralateral breast cancers was 10.3% for LO, 10.2% for LRT (B-17), 10.8% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 7.3% for LRT + TAM. I-IBTR was associated with increased mortality risk (HR of death = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.96, P < .001), whereas recurrence of DCIS was not. Twenty-two of 39 deaths after I-IBTR were attributed to breast cancer. Among all patients (with or without I-IBTR), the 15-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer death was 3.1% for LO, 4.7% for LRT (B-17), 2.7% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 2.3% for LRT + TAM.",

Fixed and random effects methods were used to combine data. Primary outcomes were death, disease progression, distant disease recurrence, and loco-regional disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were local response and conservative local treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "We found no statistically or clinically significant difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy arms associated with death (summary risk ratio [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.12), disease progression (summary RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.07), or distant disease recurrence (summary RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.06). However, neoadjuvant therapy was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of loco-regional disease recurrences (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.43), compared with adjuvant therapy, especially in trials where more patients in the neoadjuvant, than the adjuvant, arm received radiation therapy without surgery (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.10). Across trials, we observed heterogeneity in the rates of complete clinical response (range = 7%-65%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), pathologic response (range = 4%-29%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), and adoption of conservative local treatment (range = 28%-89% in neoadjuvant arms, P for heterogeneity of <.001).",

        "Methods": "Women with completely locally excised DCIS were recruited into a randomised 2×2 factorial trial of radiotherapy, tamoxifen, or both. Randomisation was independently done for each of the two treatments (radiotherapy and tamoxifen), stratified by screening assessment centre, and blocked in groups of four. The recommended dose for radiation was 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (2 Gy per day on weekdays), and tamoxifen was prescribed at a dose of 20 mg daily for 5 years. Elective decision to withhold or provide one of the treatments was permitted. The endpoints of primary interest were invasive ipsilateral new breast events for the radiotherapy comparison and any new breast event, including contralateral disease and DCIS, for tamoxifen. Analysis of each of the two treatment comparisons was restricted to patients who were randomly assigned to that treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat. All trial drugs have been completed and this study is in long-term follow-up. This study is registered, number ISRCTN99513870.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between May, 1990, and August, 1998, 1701 women were randomly assigned to radiotherapy and tamoxifen, radiotherapy alone, tamoxifen alone, or to no adjuvant treatment. Seven patients had protocol violations and thus 1694 patients were available for analysis. After a median follow-up of 12·7 years (IQR 10·9-14·7), 376 (163 invasive [122 ipsilateral vs 39 contralateral], 197 DCIS [174 ipsilateral vs 17 contralateral], and 16 of unknown invasiveness or laterality) breast cancers were diagnosed. Radiotherapy reduced the incidence of all new breast events (hazard ratio [HR] 0·41, 95% CI 0·30-0·56; p<0·0001), reducing the incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease (0·32, 0·19-0·56; p<0·0001) as well as ipsilateral DCIS (0·38, 0·22-0·63; p<0·0001), but having no effect on contralateral breast cancer (0·84, 0·45-1·58; p=0·6). Tamoxifen reduced the incidence of all new breast events (HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·58-0·88; p=0·002), reducing recurrent ipsilateral DCIS (0·70, 0·51-0·86; p=0·03) and contralateral tumours (0·44, 0·25-0·77; p=0·005), but having no effect on ipsilateral invasive disease (0·95, 0·66-1·38; p=0·8). No data on adverse events except cause of death were collected for this trial.",

Estimates of the net benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared by age, race, and categories of predicted breast cancer risk. Statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "After 7 years of follow-up, the cumulative rate of invasive breast cancer was reduced from 42.5 per 1000 women in the placebo group to 24.8 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.70) and the cumulative rate of noninvasive breast cancer was reduced from 15.8 per 1000 women in the placebo group to 10.2 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.89). These reductions were similar to those seen in the initial report. Tamoxifen led to a 32% reduction in osteoporotic fractures (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.92). Relative risks of stroke, deep-vein thrombosis, and cataracts (which increased with tamoxifen) and of ischemic heart disease and death (which were not changed with tamoxifen) were also similar to those initially reported. Risks of pulmonary embolism were approximately 11% lower than in the original report, and risks of endometrial cancer were about 29% higher, but these differences were not statistically significant. The net benefit achieved with tamoxifen varied according to age, race, and level of breast cancer risk.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Despite the potential bias caused by the unblinding of the P-1 trial, the magnitudes of all beneficial and undesirable treatment effects of tamoxifen were similar to those initially reported, with notable reductions in breast cancer and increased risks of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer. Readily identifiable subsets of individuals comprising 2.5 million women could derive a net benefit from the drug.",

We compared changes in incidence rates over 3-year intervals by breast cancer subtype and race using SEER*Stat. Survival differences by breast cancer subtype and race were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank statistics. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between 1988 and 1990 and 1997 and 1999, IBC incidence rates (per 100,000 woman-years) increased from 2.0 to 2.5 (P < .001), whereas those for LABC declined (2.5 to 2.0, P = .0025), as did those for non-T4 breast cancer (108 to 101, P = .0084). IBC incidence rates were statistically significantly higher in black women (3.1) than in white women (2.2) during the study period (P < .001). Women diagnosed with IBC had statistically significantly poorer survival than women with either LABC or non-T4 breast cancer (log-rank test, P < .001).

        "Methods": "This retrospective analysis consisted of 1071 patients, comprising 240 patients with IBC and 831 patients with non-IBC LABC who were enrolled in 10 consecutive clinical trials (5 from each disease group). All patients received similar multidisciplinary treatment. The authors measured time to disease recurrence for each individual site from the start of treatment to the date of disease recurrence or last follow-up (recurrence-free survival) and overall survival rates to the date of last follow-up or death.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median follow-up period was 69 months (range, 1-367 months). Pathologically complete response rates were 13.9% and 11.7% in the IBC and non-IBC LABC groups, respectively (P = .42). The 5-year estimates of cumulative incidence of recurrence were 64.8 % and 43.4% (P < .0001), respectively, for IBC and non-IBC LABC. IBC had significantly higher cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence and distant soft-tissue and bone disease. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 40.5% for the IBC group (95% CI, 34.5%-47.4%) and 63.2% for the non-IBC LABC group (95% CI, 60.0%-66.6%; P < .0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "IBC was associated with a worse prognosis and a distinctive pattern of early recurrence compared with LABC. These data suggested that investigating factors affecting \"homing\" of cancer cells may provide novel treatment strategies for IBC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "For gene expression analysis, IBC (n=14) was clinically defined as rapid-onset cancer associated with erythema and skin changes, whereas non-IBC patients (n=20) had stage III breast cancers, and cDNA analysis was carried out using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) HG-U133A microarrays. Tissue arrays were constructed from paraffin-embedded material, and the molecular phenotype of 75 IBC was compared with results from>2,000 non-IBC.",
        "Results/Findings": "Gene expression analyses indicated that IBC has higher expression of genes associated with increased metabolic rate, lipid signaling, and cell turnover relative to non-IBC tumors. Consistent with the expression analysis, IBC had statistically higher Ki-67 (93% versus 11%; P<0.001). BAX expression, reflecting increased apoptosis and cell turnover, was significantly uniformly higher in almost all IBC (98% versus 66%; P<0.05), whereas the expression of Bcl-2 was not significantly different. IBC tumors were more likely to be steroid hormone receptor negative (estrogen receptor, 49% versus 30%; P=0.002; progesterone receptor, 68% versus 42%; P=0.001). The expression of tyrosine kinases was not significantly different. E-cadherin was found to be expressed in 87% of IBC, whereas the expression p53 was not significantly different.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study is one of the largest molecular analyses of IBC. Both IBC and non-IBC are genetically heterogeneous with consistent differences in the molecular phenotype of IBC.",

Overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BC-SS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards ratios.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 2,014 IBC, 1,268 LABC, 3,059 MBC, and 73,758 non-T4 breast cancer patient cases were identified. HER2+ was associated with advanced tumor stage (P < 0.0001). IBC patient cases were more likely to be HER2+ (40%) and less likely to be hormone receptor-positive (HmR+) (59%) compared with LABC (35% and 69%, respectively), MBC (35% and 74%), and non-T4 patient cases (22% and 82%). HmR+ status was associated with improved OS and BC-SS for each breast cancer subtype after adjustment for clinically relevant factors. In multivariate analysis, HER2+ (versus HER2-) status was associated with poor BC-SS for non-T4 patient cases (hazards ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.28) and had a borderline significant association with improved BC-SS for IBC (hazards ratio = 0.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.68 to 0.99).",

        "Methods": "In all, 179 patients with IBC, diagnosed between 1989 and 2005, with known HER-2 status, and treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen without trastuzumab, were included in the analysis. Patients with HER-2-positive disease who received trastuzumab at the time of disease recurrence were included. Survival outcomes were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and compared across groups using the log-rank statistic. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to determine the association of survival outcomes with HER-2 status after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 111 patients (62%) had HER-2-negative disease and 68 (38%) had HER-2-positive disease. The median follow-up among all patients was 35 months. At the time of the analysis, 62 patients (55.9%) with HER-2-negative disease and 42 patients (61.8%) with HER-2-positive disease had a recurrence. Thirty-one patients (73.8%) with HER-2-positive disease who had a disease recurrence went on to receive trastuzumab. On univariate analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for either recurrence-free survival (P = .75) or overall survival (P = .24) between patients who had HER-2-positive disease and those who had HER-2-negative disease. In a multivariate model, HER-2 status did not appear to significantly affect recurrence-free survival (hazards ratio [HR] of 0.75; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.46-1.22 [P = .241]). In the multivariate model, patients with HER-2-positive disease had a decreased hazard of death (HR of 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.93 [P = .024]) compared with patients with HER-2-negative disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "HER-2 status, in the absence of trastuzumab, did not appear to significantly affect recurrence-free survival. After adjusting for other characteristics, the addition of trastuzumab in the metastatic setting significantly improved survival in the HER-2-positive group above and beyond that of the HER-2-negative group. This gives us further insight into the biology of this aggressive disease and underlines the major effect of targeted intervention.",

        "Methods": "In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 randomised trial in hospitals and medical clinics, treatment-naive adults with locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, increasing to 100 mg/m(2) from cycle 2 if tolerated; group A), pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B), pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C), or pertuzumab and docetaxel (group D). After surgery, patients received three cycles of FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks (patients in group C received four cycles of docetaxel prior to FEC), and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks to complete 1 year's treatment (17 cycles in total). Randomisation was done by a central centre using dynamic allocation, stratified by operable, locally advanced, and inflammatory breast cancer, and by oestrogen and/or progesterone receptor positivity. Safety analyses were done according to treatment received. The primary endpoint (pathological complete response) was previously reported; secondary endpoints reported here are 5-year progression-free survival (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and disease-free survival (analysed in patients who had surgery). Secondary and exploratory analyses were not powered for formal statistical hypothesis testing, and therefore results are for descriptive purposes only. The study ended on Sept 22, 2014 (last patient, last visit). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 17, 2007, and Dec 22, 2009, 417 eligible patients were randomly assigned to group A (107 patients), group B (107 patients), group C (107 patients), or group D (96 patients). One patient in group A withdrew before treatment. One patient assigned to group D received group A treatment, one patient assigned to group D received group B treatment, and one patient assigned to group B received group C treatment. At clinical cutoff, 87 patients had progressed or died. 5-year progression-free survival rates were 81% (95% CI 71-87) for group A, 86% (77-91) for group B, 73% (64-81) for group C, and 73% (63-81) for group D (hazard ratios 0·69 [95% CI 0·34-1·40] group B vs group A, 1·25 [0·68-2·30] group C vs group A, and 2·05 [1·07-3·93] group D vs group B). Disease-free survival results were consistent with progression-free survival results and were 81% (95% CI 72-88) for group A, 84% (72-91) for group B, 80% (70-86) for group C, and 75% (64-83) for group D. Patients who achieved total pathological complete response (all groups combined) had longer progression-free survival compared with patients who did not (85% [76-91] in patients who achieved total pathological response vs 76% [71-81] in patients who did not achieve total pathological response; hazard ratio 0·54 [95% CI 0·29-1·00]). There were no new or long-term safety concerns and tolerability was similar across groups (neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment periods combined). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (group A: 71 [66%] of 107 patients; group B: 59 [55%] of 107; group C: 40 [37%] of 108; group D: 60 [64%] of 94), febrile neutropenia (group A: 10 [9%]; group B: 12 [11%]; group C: 5 [5%]; group D: 15 [16%]), and leucopenia (group A: 13 [12%]; group B: 6 [6%]; group C: 4 [4%]; group D: 8 [9%]). The number of patients with one or more serious adverse event was similar across groups (19-22 serious adverse events per group in 18-22% of patients).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Progression-free survival and disease-free survival at 5-year follow-up show large and overlapping CIs, but support the primary endpoint (pathological complete response) and suggest that neoadjuvant pertuzumab is beneficial when combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel.

        "Results/Findings": "Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different among studies, and patients who achieved a QpCR had significantly better prognosis (DFS, p < 0.001; OS, p = 0.002). Patients with triple-negative (TN) tumors had worse prognosis than patients with the other subtypes (DFS, p = 0.03; OS, p = 0.10). A Cox proportional hazards model showed node-positive, TN, and QpCR were the significant predictors for DFS and OS among study, age, tumor size, nuclear grade, nodal status, subtype, clinical response, and pathologic response (DFS; node-positive, HR = 2.29, p = 0.001; TN, HR = 3.39, p < 0.001; QpCR, HR = 0.27, p < 0.001: OS; node-positive, HR = 3.05, p = 0.003; TN, HR = 4.92, p < 0.001; QpCR, HR = 0.12, p < 0.001).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "OlympiAD, a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label study ( ), enrolled patients with a germline BRCAm and HER2-negative mBC who had received ≤2 lines of chemotherapy for mBC. Patients were randomized to olaparib tablets (300 mg bid) or predeclared TPC (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). OS and safety were secondary end points.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 205 patients were randomized to olaparib and 97 to TPC. At 64% data maturity, median OS was 19.3 months with olaparib versus 17.1 months with TPC (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66-1.23; P = 0.513); median follow-up was 25.3 and 26.3 months, respectively. HR for OS with olaparib versus TPC in prespecified subgroups were: prior chemotherapy for mBC [no (first-line setting): 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; yes (second/third-line): 1.13, 0.79-1.64]; receptor status (triple negative: 0.93, 0.62-1.43; hormone receptor positive: 0.86, 0.55-1.36); prior platinum (yes: 0.83, 0.49-1.45; no: 0.91, 0.64-1.33). Adverse events during olaparib treatment were generally low grade and manageable by supportive treatment or dose modification. There was a low rate of treatment discontinuation (4.9%), and the risk of developing anemia did not increase with extended olaparib exposure.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "While there was no statistically significant improvement in OS with olaparib compared to TPC, there was the possibility of meaningful OS benefit among patients who had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Participants were postmenopausal patients with invasive operable breast cancer who had completed primary therapy and were eligible to receive adjuvant hormonal therapy. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival and occurrence of adverse events. Analysis for efficacy was by intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "9366 patients were recruited, of whom 3125 were randomly assigned anastrozole, 3116 tamoxifen, and 3125 combination. Median follow-up was 33.3 months. 7839 (84%) patients were known to be hormone-receptor-positive. Disease-free survival at 3 years was 89.4% on anastrozole and 87.4% on tamoxifen (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.71-0.96], p=0.013). Results with the combination were not significantly different from those with tamoxifen alone (87.2%, 1.02 [0.89-1.18], p=0.8). The improvement in disease-free survival with anastrozole was seen in the subgroup of hormone-receptor-positive patients, but not the receptor-negative patients. Incidence of contralateral breast cancer was significantly lower with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (odds ratio 0.42 [0.22-0.79], p=0.007). Anastrozole was significantly better tolerated than tamoxifen with respect to endometrial cancer (p=0.02), vaginal bleeding and discharge (p<0.0001 for both), cerebrovascular events (p=0.0006), venous thromboembolic events (p=0.0006), and hot flushes (p<0.0001).

The primary efficacy variable was disease-free survival, including local or distant recurrence, new contralateral breast cancer, or death. Secondary variables were overall survival and assessment of safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "Switching to anastrozole resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.00; P = .049), and improved overall survival (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.99; P = .045) compared with continuing on tamoxifen. Fewer patients who switched to anastrozole reported serious adverse events (22.7% v 30.8%) compared with those who continued on tamoxifen, mainly due to more patients in the tamoxifen group with endometrial events. The overall safety profile for anastrozole was consistent with previous reports and no new safety issues were identified.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postmenopausal women who have taken tamoxifen for 2 years as adjuvant therapy are less likely to experience a recurrence of breast cancer and have improved overall survival if they switch to anastrozole compared with continuing to receive tamoxifen.",

        "Methods": "This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at 188 centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were premenopausal women aged 18-59 years who had histologically or cytologically confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria, or at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion; and had not received previous treatment with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors. Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting was permitted, as was up to one line of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via interactive response technology to receive oral ribociclib (600 mg/day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) or matching placebo with either oral tamoxifen (20 mg daily) or a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (letrozole 2·5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg, both oral, daily), all with goserelin (3·6 mg administered subcutaneously on day 1 of every 28-day cycle). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. MONALEESA-7 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,   and is ongoing, but no longer enrolling patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Dec 17, 2014, and Aug 1, 2016, 672 patients were randomly assigned: 335 to the ribociclib group and 337 to the placebo group. Per investigator's assessment, median progression-free survival was 23·8 months (95% CI 19·2-not reached) in the ribociclib group compared with 13·0 months (11·0-16·4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·44-0·69; p<0·0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients in either group were neutropenia (203 [61%] of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 12 [4%] of 337 in the placebo group) and leucopenia (48 [14%] and four [1%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 60 (18%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 39 (12%) of 337 in the placebo group, of which 15 (4%) and six (2%), respectively, were attributed to the study regimen. 12 (4%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and ten (3%) of 337 in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 11 deaths occurred (five [1%] in the ribociclib group and six [2%] in the placebo group) during or within 30 days after treatment, most of which were due to progression of the underlying breast cancer (three [1%] and six [2%]). The remaining two deaths in the ribociclib group were due to an intracranial haemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient, and a pre-existing wound haemorrhage in another patient.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy improved progression-free survival compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy, and had a manageable safety profile in patients with premenopausal, HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer.

A total of 42 women in the placebo group and 31 women in the letrozole group died (P=0.25 for the comparison of overall survival). Low-grade hot flashes, arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia were more frequent in the letrozole group, but vaginal bleeding was less frequent.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Information was available on 42,000 women in 78 randomised treatment comparisons (radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy, 23,500; more vs less surgery, 9300; more surgery vs radiotherapy, 9300). 24 types of local treatment comparison were identified. To help relate the effect on local (ie, locoregional) recurrence to that on breast cancer mortality, these were grouped according to whether or not the 5-year local recurrence risk exceeded 10% (<10%, 17,000 women; >10%, 25,000 women).",
        "Results/Findings": "About three-quarters of the eventual local recurrence risk occurred during the first 5 years. In the comparisons that involved little (<10%) difference in 5-year local recurrence risk there was little difference in 15-year breast cancer mortality. Among the 25,000 women in the comparisons that involved substantial (>10%) differences, however, 5-year local recurrence risks were 7% active versus 26% control (absolute reduction 19%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks were 44.6% versus 49.5% (absolute reduction 5.0%, SE 0.8, 2p<0.00001). These 25,000 women included 7300 with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in trials of radiotherapy (generally just to the conserved breast), with 5-year local recurrence risks (mainly in the conserved breast, as most had axillary clearance and node-negative disease) 7% versus 26% (reduction 19%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks 30.5% versus 35.9% (reduction 5.4%, SE 1.7, 2p=0.0002; overall mortality reduction 5.3%, SE 1.8, 2p=0.005). They also included 8500 with mastectomy, axillary clearance, and node-positive disease in trials of radiotherapy (generally to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes), with similar absolute gains from radiotherapy; 5-year local recurrence risks (mainly at these sites) 6% versus 23% (reduction 17%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks 54.7% versus 60.1% (reduction 5.4%, SE 1.3, 2p=0.0002; overall mortality reduction 4.4%, SE 1.2, 2p=0.0009). Radiotherapy produced similar proportional reductions in local recurrence in all women (irrespective of age or tumour characteristics) and in all major trials of radiotherapy versus not (recent or older; with or without systemic therapy), so large absolute reductions in local recurrence were seen only if the control risk was large. To help assess the life-threatening side-effects of radiotherapy, the trials of radiotherapy versus not were combined with those of radiotherapy versus more surgery. There was, at least with some of the older radiotherapy regimens, a significant excess incidence of contralateral breast cancer (rate ratio 1.18, SE 0.06, 2p=0.002) and a significant excess of non-breast-cancer mortality in irradiated women (rate ratio 1.12, SE 0.04, 2p=0.001). Both were slight during the first 5 years, but continued after year 15. The excess mortality was mainly from heart disease (rate ratio 1.27, SE 0.07, 2p=0.0001) and lung cancer (rate ratio 1.78, SE 0.22, 2p=0.0004).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In these trials, avoidance of a local recurrence in the conserved breast after BCS and avoidance of a local recurrence elsewhere (eg, the chest wall or regional nodes) after mastectomy were of comparable relevance to 15-year breast cancer mortality. Differences in local treatment that substantially affect local recurrence rates would, in the hypothetical absence of any other causes of death, avoid about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years for every four local recurrences avoided, and should reduce 15-year overall mortality.",

        "Methods": "We did a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial at 16 hospitals and medical centres in seven European countries. 1184 patients with low-risk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ treated with breast-conserving surgery were centrally randomised to either whole-breast irradiation or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Analysis was done according to treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between April 20, 2004, and July 30, 2009, 551 patients had whole-breast irradiation with tumour-bed boost and 633 patients received APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy. At 5-year follow-up, nine patients treated with APBI and five patients receiving whole-breast irradiation had a local recurrence; the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 1.44% (95% CI 0.51-2.38) with APBI and 0.92% (0.12-1.73) with whole-breast irradiation (difference 0.52%, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.75; p=0.42). No grade 4 late side-effects were reported. The 5-year risk of grade 2-3 late side-effects to the skin was 3.2% with APBI versus 5.7% with whole-breast irradiation (p=0.08), and 5-year risk of grade 2-3 subcutaneous tissue late side-effects was 7.6% versus 6.3% (p=0.53).

        "Methods": "PHARE is an open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority randomised trial of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer comparing 6 months versus 12 months of trastuzumab treatment concomitant with or following standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The study was undertaken in 156 centres in France. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast and either positive axillary nodes or negative axillary nodes but a tumour of at least 10 mm. Participants must have received at least four cycles of a chemotherapy for this breast cancer and have started receiving adjuvant trastuzumab-treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either 6 months or 12 months of trastuzumab therapy duration between the third and sixth months of adjuvant trastuzumab. The randomisation was stratified by concomitant or sequential treatment with chemotherapy, oestrogen receptor status, and centre. The primary objective was non-inferiority in the intention-to-treat population in the 6-month group in terms of disease-free survival with a prespecified hazard margin of 1·15. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "3384 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 12 months (n=1691) or 6 months (n=1693) of adjuvant trastuzumab. One patient in the 12-month group and three patients in the 6-month group were excluded, so 1690 patients in each group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At a median follow-up of 7·5 years (IQR 5·3-8·8), 704 events relevant to disease-free survival were observed (345 [20·4%] in the 12-month group and 359 [21·2%] in the 6-month group). The adjusted hazard ratio for disease-free survival in the 12-month group versus the 6-month group was 1·08 (95% CI 0·93-1·25; p=0·39). The non-inferiority margin was included in the 95% CI. No differences in effects pertaining to trastuzumab duration were found in any of the subgroups. After the completion of trastuzumab treatment, rare adverse events occurred over time and the safety analysis remained similar to the previously published report. In particular, we found no change in the cardiac safety comparison, and only three additional cases in which the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased to less than 50% have been reported in the 12-month group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The PHARE study did not show the non-inferiority of 6 months versus 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab. Hence, adjuvant trastuzumab standard duration should remain 12 months.",

        "Results/Findings": "The benefit of lumpectomy plus radiation was virtually unchanged between 5 and 8 years of follow-up and was due to a reduction in invasive and noninvasive ipsilateral breast tumors (IBTs). Incidence of locoregional and distant events remained similar in both treatment groups; deaths were only infrequently related to breast cancer.

Analysis by treatment group showed average number of AEs per person was lower in partial-breast (incidence rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and reduced-dose (incidence rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.90; P < .001) versus whole-breast group and decreased over time in all groups. Younger age, larger breast size/surgical deficit, lymph node positivity, and higher levels of anxiety/depression were baseline predictors of subsequent AE reporting.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Most AEs reduced over time, with fewer AEs in the partial-breast and reduced-dose groups. Baseline predictors for AE reporting were identified. These findings will facilitate informed discussion and shared decision making for future patients receiving moderately hypofractionated breast radiotherapy.",

This report focuses on the TNBC cohort.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among 111 patients with TNBC whose tumor samples were screened for PD-L1 expression, 58.6% had PD-L1-positive tumors. Thirty-two women (median age, 50.5 years; range, 29 to 72 years) were enrolled and assessed for safety and antitumor activity. The median number of doses administered was five (range, 1 to 36 doses). Common toxicities were mild and similar to those observed in other tumor cohorts (eg, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea), and included five (15.6%) patients with grade ≥ 3 toxicity and one treatment-related death. Among the 27 patients who were evaluable for antitumor activity, the overall response rate was 18.5%, the median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range, 7.3 to 32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range, 15.0 to ≥ 47.3 weeks).",

        "Methods": "A retrospective review of three surgeons' experience was performed for immediate single-stage implant reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix and tissue expander reconstruction without it at Massachusetts General Hospital.",
        "Results/Findings": "Two hundred eleven patients had 331 direct-to-implant reconstructions using AlloDerm following nipple-sparing (n = 66) or skin-sparing (n = 265) mastectomy for cancer (n = 216) or prophylaxis (n = 115). The number of single-stage implant reconstructions increased from seven in 2006 to 116 in 2009. The percentage performed for prophylaxis increased from 29 percent to 41 percent. Fifty-one patients underwent preoperative (n = 33) or postoperative (n = 18) irradiation. Total complications included 10 infections (3.0 percent), five seromas (1.5 percent), four hematomas (1.2 percent), and 30 reconstructions (9.1 percent), with skin necrosis leading to five implant losses (1.5 percent). Tissue expander reconstruction without AlloDerm had a similar total complication rate (158 reconstructions) (p = 0.18), including nine infections (5.7 percent), three seromas (1.9 percent), three hematomas (1.9 percent), and 16 reconstructions (10.1 percent), with skin necrosis leading to 11 implant losses (7.0 percent). A higher complication rate occurred in the surgeons' combined first year performing single-stage implant reconstruction (21.4 percent) compared with subsequent years (10.9 percent) (p < 0.02) and in one- or two-stage reconstruction patients undergoing irradiation (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in total overall costs (p = 0.8).",

        "Methods": "Patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy were enrolled in the randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 non-inferiority EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive either axillary lymph node dissection or axillary radiotherapy in case of a positive sentinel node, stratified by institution. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of 5-year axillary recurrence, considered to be not more than 4% for the axillary radiotherapy group compared with an expected 2% in the axillary lymph node dissection group. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol. The AMAROS trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Feb 19, 2001, and April 29, 2010, 4823 patients were enrolled at 34 centres from nine European countries, of whom 4806 were eligible for randomisation. 2402 patients were randomly assigned to receive axillary lymph node dissection and 2404 to receive axillary radiotherapy. Of the 1425 patients with a positive sentinel node, 744 had been randomly assigned to axillary lymph node dissection and 681 to axillary radiotherapy; these patients constituted the intention-to-treat population. Median follow-up was 6·1 years (IQR 4·1-8·0) for the patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes. In the axillary lymph node dissection group, 220 (33%) of 672 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection had additional positive nodes. Axillary recurrence occurred in four of 744 patients in the axillary lymph node dissection group and seven of 681 in the axillary radiotherapy group. 5-year axillary recurrence was 0·43% (95% CI 0·00-0·92) after axillary lymph node dissection versus 1·19% (0·31-2·08) after axillary radiotherapy. The planned non-inferiority test was underpowered because of the low number of events. The one-sided 95% CI for the underpowered non-inferiority test on the hazard ratio was 0·00-5·27, with a non-inferiority margin of 2. Lymphoedema in the ipsilateral arm was noted significantly more often after axillary lymph node dissection than after axillary radiotherapy at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Axillary lymph node dissection and axillary radiotherapy after a positive sentinel node provide excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy.

        "Methods": "A tissue microarray (TMA) series was constructed consisting of 4,444 invasive breast cancers diagnosed in British Columbia from 1986 to 1992. Within this series, 2,026 patients were node negative, of whom 70% did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy. The TMA series was assessed for estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate odds ratios at the 10-year follow-up.",
        "Results/Findings": "HER2 was positive in 10.2% of the node-negative cohort. In this cohort, an inferior outcome was seen in patients with HER2-positive tumors compared with HER2-negative tumors for 10-year relapse-free survival (RFS; 65.9% v 75.5%, respectively; P = .01), distant RFS (71.2% v 81.8%, respectively; P = .004), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS; 75.5% v 86.3%, respectively; P = .001). A trend for a worse overall survival was also seen (P = .06). HER2 was an independent poor prognostic factor for RFS and BCSS at 10 years, with odds ratios of 1.71 (P = .01) and 2.03 (P = .003), respectively. The number of HER2-positive tumors that were <or= 1 cm was small, but there was a trend for a worse outcome in T1b tumors.",

        "Methods": "One thousand eight hundred eighty-two patients > 40 years of age who underwent breast-conserving surgery for node-negative breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were randomly assigned to radiotherapy at a dose of either 50 Gy in 25 fr or 40 Gy in 15 fr. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration assuming noninferiority regarding locoregional recurrence.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 1,854 consenting patients (50 Gy, n = 937; 40 Gy, n = 917) were enrolled from 2009-2014 from eight centers. There were 1,608 patients with adenocarcinoma and 246 patients with DCIS. The 3-year rates of induration were 11.8% (95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 9.0% (95% CI, 7.2% to 11.1%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.6% to 0.2%;   = .07). Systemic therapies and radiotherapy boost did not increase the risk of induration. Telangiectasia, dyspigmentation, scar appearance, edema, and pain were detected at low rates, and cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction with breast appearance were high with either no difference or better outcome in the 40-Gy cohort compared with the 50-Gy cohort. The 9-year risk of locoregional recurrence was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0% to 5.0%) in the 50-Gy group and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9% to 4.5%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, -0.3%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 1.7%). The 9-year overall survival was 93.4% (95% CI, 91.1% to 95.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 93.4% (95% CI, 91.0% to 95.2%) in the 40-Gy group. The occurrence of radiation-associated cardiac and lung disease was rare and not influenced by the fractionation regimen.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation of node-negative breast cancer or DCIS did not result in more breast induration compared with standard fractionated therapy. Other normal tissue effects were minimal, with similar or less frequent rates in the 40-Gy group. The 9-year locoregional recurrence risk was low.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In the worldwide Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial, 12,894 women with early breast cancer who had completed 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomly allocated to continue tamoxifen to 10 years or stop at 5 years (open control). Allocation (1:1) was by central computer, using minimisation. After entry (between 1996 and 2005), yearly follow-up forms recorded any recurrence, second cancer, hospital admission, or death. We report effects on breast cancer outcomes among the 6846 women with ER-positive disease, and side-effects among all women (with positive, negative, or unknown ER status). Long-term follow-up still continues. This study is registered, number ISRCTN19652633.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among women with ER-positive disease, allocation to continue tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences in 3428 women allocated to continue vs 711 in 3418 controls, p=0·002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths vs 397 deaths, p=0·01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths vs 722 deaths, p=0·01). The reductions in adverse breast cancer outcomes appeared to be less extreme before than after year 10 (recurrence rate ratio [RR] 0·90 [95% CI 0·79–1·02] during years 5–9 and 0·75 [0·62–0·90] in later years; breast cancer mortality RR 0·97 [0·79–1·18] during years 5–9 and 0·71 [0·58–0·88] in later years). The cumulative risk of recurrence during years 5–14 was 21·4% for women allocated to continue versus 25·1% for controls; breast cancer mortality during years 5–14 was 12·2% for women allocated to continue versus 15·0% for controls (absolute mortality reduction 2·8%). Treatment allocation seemed to have no effect on breast cancer outcome among 1248 women with ER-negative disease, and an intermediate effect among 4800 women with unknown ER status. Among all 12,894 women, mortality without recurrence from causes other than breast cancer was little affected (691 deaths without recurrence in 6454 women allocated to continue versus 679 deaths in 6440 controls; RR 0·99 [0·89–1·10]; p=0·84). For the incidence (hospitalisation or death) rates of specific diseases, RRs were as follows: pulmonary embolus 1·87 (95% CI 1·13–3·07, p=0·01 [including 0·2% mortality in both treatment groups]), stroke 1·06 (0·83–1·36), ischaemic heart disease 0·76 (0·60–0·95, p=0·02), and endometrial cancer 1·74 (1·30–2·34, p=0·0002). The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5–14 was 3·1% (mortality 0·4%) for women allocated to continue versus 1·6% (mortality 0·2%) for controls (absolute mortality increase 0·2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For women with ER-positive disease, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than stopping at 5 years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality, particularly after year 10. These results, taken together with results from previous trials of 5 years of tamoxifen treatment versus none, suggest that 10 years of tamoxifen treatment can approximately halve breast cancer mortality during the second decade after diagnosis.",

Median follow-up was 59 months, and 548 women were followed for ≥8 years. The relationship between MRI and LRR was examined using multivariable analysis.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 184 LRR events; 5- and 8-year LRR rates were 8.5 and 14.6 % (MRI), respectively, and 7.2 and 10.2 % (no-MRI), respectively (p = 0.52). LRR was significantly associated with age, menopausal status, margin status, RT, and endocrine therapy. After controlling for these variables and family history, presentation, number of excisions, and time period of surgery, there remained no trend toward association of MRI and lower LRR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.78, p = 0.42]. Restriction of analysis to the no-RT subgroup showed no association of MRI with lower LRR rates (HR 1.36, 95 % CI 0.78-2.39, p = 0.28). No difference in 5- or 8-year rates of CBC was seen between the MRI (3.5 and 3.5 %) and no-MRI (3.5 and 5.1 %) groups (p = 0.86).",

The primary end point was disease-free survival. The primary analysis included all the patients who were still participating in the trial and who had no recurrence 2 years after randomization (i.e., when treatment in the 2-year group had ended). Secondary end points were overall survival, contralateral breast cancer, second primary cancer, and clinical bone fracture.",
        "Results/Findings": "Among the 3484 women who were enrolled in the trial, 3208 remained in the trial without disease progression after the first 2 years of extended anastrozole treatment following randomization. Among these women, disease progression or death occurred in 335 women in each treatment group in the primary-analysis set at 8 years (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.15; P = 0.90). No between-group differences occurred in most secondary end points, and subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in any particular subgroup.

        "Methods": "In this multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial, patients were eligible if they had clinically non-palpable axillary lymph node(s) and a primary tumour of 5 cm or less and who, after sentinel-node biopsy, had one or more micrometastatic (≤2 mm) sentinel lymph nodes with no extracapsular extension. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to either undergo axillary dissection or not to undergo axillary dissection. Randomisation was stratified by centre and menopausal status. Treatment assignment was not masked. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Non-inferiority was defined as a hazard ratio (HR) of less than 1·25 for no axillary dissection versus axillary dissection. The analysis was by intention to treat. Per protocol, disease and survival information continues to be collected yearly. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between April 1, 2001, and Feb 28, 2010, 465 patients were randomly assigned to axillary dissection and 469 to no axillary dissection. After the exclusion of three patients, 464 patients were in the axillary dissection group and 467 patients were in the no axillary dissection group. After a median follow-up of 5·0 (IQR 3·6-7·3) years, we recorded 69 disease-free survival events in the axillary dissection group and 55 events in the no axillary dissection group. Breast-cancer-related events were recorded in 48 patients in the axillary dissection group and 47 in the no axillary dissection group (ten local recurrences in the axillary dissection group and eight in the no axillary dissection group; three and nine contralateral breast cancers; one and five [corrected] regional recurrences; and 34 and 25 distant relapses). Other non-breast cancer events were recorded in 21 patients in the axillary dissection group and eight in the no axillary dissection group (20 and six second non-breast malignancies; and one and two deaths not due to a cancer event). 5-year disease-free survival was 87·8% (95% CI 84·4-91·2) in the group without axillary dissection and 84·4% (80·7-88·1) in the group with axillary dissection (log-rank p=0·16; HR for no axillary dissection vs axillary dissection was 0·78, 95% CI 0·55-1·11, non-inferiority p=0·0042). Patients with reported long-term surgical events (grade 3-4) included one sensory neuropathy (grade 3), three lymphoedema (two grade 3 and one grade 4), and three motor neuropathy (grade 3), all in the group that underwent axillary dissection, and one grade 3 motor neuropathy in the group without axillary dissection. One serious adverse event was reported, a postoperative infection in the axilla in the group with axillary dissection.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Between April 16, 2003, and Dec 22, 2009, 1326 women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer judged low-risk (ie, hormone receptor-positive, axillary node-negative, T1-T2 up to 3 cm at the longest dimension, and clear margins; grade 3 tumour histology or lymphovascular invasion, but not both, were permitted), who had had breast-conserving surgery and were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment, were recruited into a phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 76 centres in four countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either whole-breast radiotherapy (40-50 Gy in 15-25 fractions) or no radiotherapy by computer-generated permuted block randomisation, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence. Follow-up continues and will end at the 10-year anniversary of the last randomised patient. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN95889329.",
        "Results/Findings": "658 women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and who were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation and 668 were allocated to no further treatment. After median follow-up of 5 years (IQR 3·84-6·05), ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was 1·3% (95% CI 0·2-2·3; n=5) in women assigned to whole-breast radiotherapy and 4·1% (2·4-5·7; n=26) in those assigned no radiotherapy (p=0·0002). Compared with women allocated to whole-breast radiotherapy, the univariate hazard ratio for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence in women assigned to no radiotherapy was 5·19 (95% CI 1·99-13·52; p=0·0007). No differences in regional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral breast cancers, or new breast cancers were noted between groups. 5-year overall survival was 93·9% (95% CI 91·8-96·0) in both groups (p=0·34). 89 women died; eight of 49 patients allocated to no radiotherapy and four of 40 assigned to radiotherapy died from breast cancer.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine treatment resulted in a significant but modest reduction in local recurrence for women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer 5 years after randomisation. However, the 5-year rate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence is probably low enough for omission of radiotherapy to be considered for some patients.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We did a meta-analysis of three clinical trials--the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG 8), Arimidex-Nolvadex (ARNO 95), and the Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole (ITA) studies--in which postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed, hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer were randomised to 1 mg/day anastrozole (n=2009) after 2-3 years of tamoxifen treatment or to continued 20 or 30 mg/day tamoxifen (n=1997). We analysed the data with a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with the covariates of age, tumour size, nodal status, grade, surgery, and chemotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "Patients who switched to anastrozole had fewer disease recurrences (92 vs 159) and deaths (66 vs 90) than did those who remained on tamoxifen, resulting in significant improvements in disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.48-0.74]; p<0.0001), event-free survival (0.55 [0.42-0.71]; p<0.0001), distant recurrence-free survival (0.61 [0.45-0.83]; p=0.002), and overall survival (0.71 [0.52-0.98]; p=0.04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results show that the clinical benefits in terms of event-free survival seen in individual trials for those patients who switched to anastrozole translate into a benefit in overall survival. These findings confirm that clinicians should consider switching postmenopausal women who have taken adjuvant tamoxifen for 2-3 years to anastrozole.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "One hundred eleven young women with early breast cancer who had not yet completed their families were recruited around the time of diagnosis. Knowledge regarding fertility-related information, decisional conflict, and preferences regarding fertility information and decision making was measured.",
        "Results/Findings": "From a potential fertility-related knowledge score of 10, the mean was 5.2 (standard deviation = 2.3; range, 0 to 10). Decreased knowledge was associated with increased decisional conflict about pursuing fertility preserving interventions (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.73; P < .001). Thirty-one percent of women reported that they would consider undertaking in vitro fertilization (IVF) as a method to conserve their fertility, whereas 38% were uncertain. Consideration of IVF was not related to whether subjects were in a committed relationship (OR = 1.20; P = .716) or a definite desire for more children (OR = 1.54; P = .513).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Around diagnosis, many young patients with breast cancer have low levels of knowledge about fertility issues. Further, low knowledge is associated with increased decisional conflict, which is likely to undermine the quality of decision making. These findings suggest that targeted and timely fertility information may reduce decisional conflict and increase informed choice. Neither relationship status nor firm plans regarding future children reliably predict desire to pursue fertility preservation.",

The content of the steroid receptors and expression of p53, EGFR, and HER2 were determined by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue. The length of follow-up was 10 years. The end point for this analysis was disease-free survival.",
        "Results/Findings": "Multivariate analysis demonstrated no increased risk of recurrence after treatment with tamoxifen for HER2-, EGFR-, and p53-positive, high-risk, steroid receptor-positive patients. Patients with steroid receptor-positive tumors and positive immunohistochemical staining for HER2, EGFR or p53 benefited from treatment with tamoxifen for 1 year, although the latter variable contained independent prognostic information by itself.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "With the statistical power of the present randomized study, we did not find support for the hypothesis that HER2/EGFR or p53 status predicts benefit from tamoxifen treatment in estrogen receptor-positive patients with early-stage breast cancer.

Selection criteria were (a) metastatic breast cancer, (b) endocrine therapy (any line of treatment), and (c) evaluation of HER-2 expression (any method). For each study, the relative risk for treatment failure for HER-2-positive over HER-2-negative patients with 95% confidence interval was calculated as an estimate of the predictive effect of HER-2. Pooled estimates of the relative risk were computed by the Mantel-Haenszel method.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twelve studies (n = 2,379 patients) were included in the meta-analysis.

        "Methods": "Patients with measurable, progressive, HER2-positive brain metastases (92% after receiving CNS surgery and/or radiotherapy) received neratinib 240 mg orally once per day plus capecitabine 750 mg/m  twice per day for 14 days, then 7 days off. Lapatinib-naïve (cohort 3A) and lapatinib-treated (cohort 3B) patients were enrolled. If nine or more of 35 (cohort 3A) or three or more of 25 (cohort 3B) had CNS objective response rates (ORR), the drug combination would be deemed promising. The primary end point was composite CNS ORR in each cohort separately, requiring a reduction of 50% or more in the sum of target CNS lesion volumes without progression of nontarget lesions, new lesions, escalating steroids, progressive neurologic signs or symptoms, or non-CNS progression.",
        "Results/Findings": "Forty-nine patients enrolled in cohorts 3A (n = 37) and 3B (n = 12; cohort closed for slow accrual). In cohort 3A, the composite CNS ORR = 49% (95% CI, 32% to 66%), and the CNS ORR in cohort 3B = 33% (95% CI, 10% to 65%). Median progression-free survival was 5.5 and 3.1 months in cohorts 3A and 3B, respectively; median survival was 13.3 and 15.1 months. Diarrhea was the most common grade 3 toxicity (29% in cohorts 3A and 3B).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Neratinib plus capecitabine is active against refractory, HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases, adding additional evidence that the efficacy of HER2-directed therapy in the brain is enhanced by chemotherapy.

The main outcome was new ipsilateral breast cancer events and distant metastasis-free survival analyzed according to intention to treat.",
        "Results/Findings": "There were 64 ipsilateral events in the RT arm and 141 in the control group corresponding to a risk reduction of 16.0 percentage points at 10 years (95% CI, 10.3% to 21.6%) and a relative risk of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54). There was no statistically significant difference in distant metastasis-free survival. There was an effect modification by age, yielding a low effect of RT in women younger than 50, but substantial protection in women older than 60 years. The age effect was not confounded by focality, lesion size, completeness of excision, or detection mode. There was no group as defined by our stratification variables that had a low risk without radiotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Our results indicate that younger women have a low protective effect of conventional RT after sector resection. Older women benefit substantially.

The primary objective was to evaluate the ability of EPclin to provide an estimate of the 10-year DR rate as a continuous function of EPclin separately for ET alone and ET + C. Cox proportional hazard models were used for these analyses.",
        "Results/Findings": "EPclin was highly prognostic for DR in women who received ET alone (HR 2.79 (2.49-3.13), P < 0.0001) as well as in those who received ET + C (HR 2.27 (1.99-2.59), P < 0.0001). Women who received ET + C had significantly smaller increases in 10-year DR rates with the increasing EPclin score than those receiving ET alone (EPclin = 5; 12% ET + C vs. 20% ET alone).

        "Results/Findings": "A total of 34 articles describing 1761 patients were identified. A repeat sentinel lymph node (rSLN) was successfully harvested from 64.3% of the patients with IBTR, and the rate was significantly higher for the patients who had a previous SLNB than for those who had a previous axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (75.7% vs. 46.1%; P < 0.0001). The rSLN was tumor-positive for 18.2% of the rSLNs, 40% of which were harvested in basins other than the ipsilateral axilla. The negative predictive value of the rSLNB was 96.5%. Overall survival, reported for 21.5% of the patients, was 95.2% after a mean follow-up period of 29.6 months.",

Further studies are needed to fill in the gap in the management of lymph nodes for patients with IBTR.

Postmenopausal women with hormone-positive ductal carcinoma in situ treated by lumpectomy with clear resection margins and whole-breast irradiation were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral tamoxifen 20 mg per day (with matching placebo in place of anastrozole) or oral anastrozole 1 mg per day (with matching placebo in place of tamoxifen) for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by age (<60 vs ≥60 years) and patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was breast cancer-free interval, defined as time from randomisation to any breast cancer event (local, regional, or distant recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer, invasive disease, or ductal carcinoma in situ), analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and is complete.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Jan 1, 2003, and June 15, 2006, 3104 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (1552 to tamoxifen and 1552 to anastrozole).

In total, 212 breast cancer-free interval events occurred: 122 in the tamoxifen group and 90 in the anastrozole group (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·56-0·96], p=0·0234). A significant time-by-treatment interaction (p=0·0410) became evident later in the study. There was also a significant interaction between treatment and age group (p=0·0379), showing that anastrozole is superior only in women younger than 60 years of age. Adverse events did not differ between the groups, except for thrombosis or embolism--a known side-effect of tamoxifen-for which there were 17 grade 4 or worse events in the tamoxifen group versus four in the anastrozole group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole treatment provided a significant improvement in breast cancer-free interval, mainly in women younger than 60 years of age.

        "Results/Findings": "Capecitabine/docetaxel resulted in significantly superior efficacy in time to disease progression (TTP) (hazard ratio, 0.652; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.545 to 0.780; P =.0001; median, 6.1 v 4.2 months), overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.634 to 0.947; P =.0126; median, 14.5 v 11.5 months), and objective tumor response rate (42% v 30%, P =.006) compared with docetaxel. Gastrointestinal side effects and hand-foot syndrome were more common with combination therapy, whereas myalgia, arthralgia, and neutropenic fever/sepsis were more common with single-agent docetaxel. More grade 3 adverse events occurred with combination therapy (71% v 49%, respectively), whereas grade 4 events were slightly more common with docetaxel (31% v 25% with combination).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The significantly superior TTP and survival achieved with the addition of capecitabine to docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), with the manageable toxicity profile, indicate that this combination provides clear benefits over single-agent docetaxel 100 mg/m(2). Docetaxel/capecitabine therapy is an important treatment option for women with anthracycline-pretreated MBC.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "During an initial 96-week period, breast cancer patients with bone metastases were randomised in double-blind fashion to placebo or ibandronic acid 6mg administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours every 3-4 weeks as part of a previously reported phase III trial (MF 4265 study). All patients completing the phase III trial were offered open-label active treatment for a further 96 weeks (extension phase). A total of 62 patients received ibandronic acid 6mg in this extension phase and were classified according to their initial treatment (placebo/ibandronic acid 6mg [placebo/6mg] and ibandronic acid 6mg/ibandronic acid 6mg [6mg/6mg] groups). Safety was assessed by AE reports and clinical laboratory evaluations.",
        "Results/Findings": "During the 4-year study, most patients experienced at least one AE, with malignancy progression being most commonly reported. However, fewer treatment-related AEs were reported in the extension phase (placebo/6mg: 6.3% [1/16]; 6mg/6mg: 13.0% [6/46]) than in the initial phase of the study (placebo: 56.3% [9/16]; 6mg: 67.4% [31/46]). Serious AEs were mainly due to malignancy progression. There were no clinically relevant renal AEs, and in both groups, serum creatinine levels were similar for up to 4 years.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This 96-week open-label safety extension of a phase III, placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that long-term use of intravenous ibandronic acid is well tolerated.",

        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-seven studies were identified that met inclusion criteria, representing a total of 3331 mastectomies. Review of oncologic outcomes in the 10 studies (representing 1148 mastectomies) with documented mean/median follow-up of 2 years demonstrated an overall local-regional recurrence rate of 2.8%. Ischemic complications involving the NAC were reported in 24 studies (representing 3091 mastectomies), with 9.1% of cases reported to have some degree of NAC necrosis and 2.0% of cases complicated by complete necrosis leading to NAC loss. Sixteen studies (representing 2213 mastectomies) reported rates of skin flap necrosis, which occurred in 9.5% of cases. Eighty-one percent of the total cases reviewed involved expander-implant reconstruction; in the 16 studies (representing 2343 reconstructions) that reported outcomes after expander-implant reconstruction, overall expander-implant loss was 3.4%.",

        "Methods": "We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify 107 106 women with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy for treatment between 1998 and 2003 and a subset of 8902 women who also underwent CPM during the same period. Associations between predictor variables and the likelihood of undergoing CPM were evaluated by use of chi(2) analyses. Risk-stratified (estrogen receptor [ER] status, stage, and age) adjusted survival analyses were performed by using Cox regression. Statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "In a univariate analysis, CPM was associated with improved disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] of death = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57 to 0.69; P < .001). Risk-stratified analysis showed that this association was because of a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality in women aged 18-49 years with stages I-II ER-negative cancer (HR of death = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.88; P = .004). Five year-adjusted breast cancer survival for this group was improved with CPM vs without (88.5% vs 83.7%, difference = 4.8%). Although rates of contralateral breast cancer among young women with stages I-II disease undergoing CPM were independent of ER status, women with ER-positive tumors in the absence of prophylactic mastectomy also had a lower overall risk for contralateral breast cancer than women with ER-negative tumors (0.46% vs 0.90%, difference = 0.44%; P < .001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "CPM is associated with a small improvement in 5-year breast cancer-specific survival mainly in young women with early-stage ER-negative breast cancer. This effect is related to a higher baseline risk of contralateral breast cancer.",

Patients were assessed each week during and up to 6 weeks after radiotherapy.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned between July 2003 and March 2005 in two Canadian centers, and 331 were included in the analysis. Breast IMRT significantly improved the dose distribution compared with standard radiation. This translated into a lower proportion of patients experiencing moist desquamation during or up to 6 weeks after their radiation treatment; 31.2% with IMRT compared with 47.8% with standard treatment (P = .002). A multivariate analysis found the use of breast IMRT (P = .003) and smaller breast size (P < .001) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of moist desquamation. The use of IMRT did not correlate with pain and quality of life, but the presence of moist desquamation did significantly correlate with pain (P = .002) and a reduced quality of life (P = .003).",

No patients included in the study received additional radiotherapy or hormonal treatment. Kaplan Meier survival curves were calculated, to determine disease free survival, for the total sample and a series of univariate analyses were performed to examine the value of various prognostic factors including the VNPI. The log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance of differential survival rates. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to analyze the significance of the individual components of the VNPI. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software, version 14.5.",
        "Results/Findings": "The mean follow-up period was 53 months (range 12-97, SD19.9). Ninety five tumours were high grade (44%) and 84 tumours exhibited comedo necrosis (39%). The closest mean initial excision margin was 2.4 mm (range 0-22 mm, standard deviation 2.8) and a total of 72 tumours (33%) underwent further re-excision. The observed and the actuarial 8 year disease-free survival rates in this study were 91% and 83% respectively. The VNPI score and the presence of comedo necrosis were the only statistically significant prognostic indicators (P < 0.05).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This follow-up study of 215 patients with DCIS treated with local excision and observation alone is one of the largest series in which rates of recurrence are unaffected by radiation therapy, hormone manipulation or chemotherapy. It has afforded us the opportunity to assess the prognostic impact of patient and tumour characteristics free of any potentially confounding treatment related influences. The results suggest that the VNPI can be used to identify a subset of patients who are at risk of local recurrence and who may potentially benefit from RT.",

Disease recurrence or death occurred in 377 patients in the zoledronic acid group and 375 of those in the control group. The numbers of deaths--243 in the zoledronic acid group and 276 in the control group--were also similar, resulting in rates of overall survival of 85.4% in the zoledronic acid group and 83.1% in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.01; P=0.07).

Similar rates were observed based on the presence or absence of stromal overgrowth. Local recurrence occurred in 4 patients, with an actuarial 10-year rate of 8%. Eight patients developed distant metastases, with an actuarial 10-year rate of 13%. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression revealed stromal overgrowth to be the only independent predictor of distant failure.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Local failure in this group of largely margin negative patients with cystosarcoma phyllodes of the breast was low, showing that breast-conserving surgery with appropriate margins is the preferred primary therapy. The current study data do not support the use of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with adequately resected disease. Patients with stromal overgrowth, particularly when the tumor size was > 5 cm, were found to have a high rate of distant failure; such patients merit consideration of a trial that examines the efficacy of systemic therapy.",

In multivariable and IPTW models, partial mastectomy alone, total mastectomy alone, and total mastectomy with RT were associated with worse OS compared with BCT (p < 0.001 all). Ten-year OS was 73.8% for BCT and 56.3, 58.0 and 56.3% for other treatment approaches. Older age, higher T/N stage, histological grade, and triple-negative receptor status were associated with poorer OS (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis by stage demonstrated similar results.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In this national sample of male breast cancer patients, BCT was associated with greater survival. The underlying mechanisms of this association warrant further study, because more routine adoption of BCT in male breast cancer appears to translate into clinically meaningful improvements in survival.",

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the HER2-positive population. Results In HR-positive, HER2-positive patients (n = 219), addition of lapatinib to letrozole significantly reduced the risk of disease progression versus letrozole-placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .019); median PFS was 8.2 v 3.0 months, respectively. Clinical benefit (responsive or stable disease >or= 6 months) was significantly greater for lapatinib-letrozole versus letrozole-placebo (48% v 29%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8; P = .003). Patients with centrally confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors (n = 952) had no improvement in PFS. A preplanned Cox regression analysis identified prior antiestrogen therapy as a significant factor in the HER2-negative population; a nonsignificant trend toward prolonged PFS for lapatinib-letrozole was seen in patients who experienced relapse less than 6 months since prior tamoxifen discontinuation (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P = .117). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common in the lapatinib-letrozole arm versus letrozole-placebo arm (diarrhea, 10% v 1%; rash, 1% v 0%, respectively), but they were manageable.",

        "Methods": "A retrospective review of 178 women treated for IBC on doxorubicin-based multimodality therapy protocols between January 1974 and September 1993 was performed. Clinical and histologic response to treatment, time to local recurrence, survival, and ultimate control of local disease were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine survival and relapse times, and Fisher's exact test was used to test differences in treatment outcomes. Significance was determined at p < or = 0.05.",
        "Results/Findings": "Median follow-up was 89 months (range 22 to 223 months). Locoregional disease persisted in seven patients and recurred in 44 patients who had been rendered disease free at a median time of 10 months. The mortality rate after a local recurrence (LR) was 98%, and all patients but one with LR developed systemic metastases. Response to induction chemotherapy influenced the incidence of LR, and the amount of residual disease found on histologic examination of mastectomy specimens was highly prognostic for local failure. Patients who underwent mastectomy in addition to radiotherapy had a lower incidence of LR than did patients who received radiotherapy alone (16.3% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.015).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The addition of mastectomy to combination chemotherapy plus radiotherapy improved local control in patients with IBC. The addition of mastectomy to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy improved distant disease-free and overall survival in patients with a clinical complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy. Patients who had no significant response to induction chemotherapy received no survival or local disease-control benefit from the addition of mastectomy to their treatment regimen.

Probabilities for developing contralateral breast cancer (CBC), dying from CBC, dying from primary breast cancer, and age-specific mortality rates were estimated from published studies. We estimated life expectancy (LE) gain, 20-year overall survival, and disease-free survival with each intervention strategy among cohorts of women defined by age, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and stage of cancer.",

Absolute 20-year survival differences ranged from 0.56% to 0.94% for women with stage I breast cancer and 0.36% to 0.61% for women with stage II breast cancer. CPM was more beneficial among younger women, stage I, and ER-negative breast cancer. Sensitivity analyses yielded a maximum 20-year survival difference with CPM of only 1.45%.",

Variables including age, smoking status, body mass index, history of diabetes, hypertension, chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as timing and laterality of reconstruction were evaluated. The primary endpoint was the development of a complication; the secondary endpoint was failure of reconstruction.",
        "Results/Findings": "Over the 2 year study period, 1170 expander/implant reconstructions were performed in 884 patients. The odds of developing complications was 2.2 times greater in smokers (p < 0.001) and 2.5 times greater in women over 65 (p = 0.008). Patients who were obese were at nearly two times the odds of having complications (p = 0.02), as were patients with hypertension (p = 0.02). Similarly, the odds of reconstructive failure were five times greater in smokers (p < 0.001). Age was not a significant predictor of reconstructive failure (p = 0.09); yet, failure was nearly seven times greater in obese patients (p < 0.001), and four more times likely in those who were hypertensive (p = 0.005).",

For ABCSG Trial 6a, patients who were disease free at the end of Trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment. Efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided P values and Kaplan-Meier curves, and tolerability data were estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",

One cardiac-related death has occurred in each arm of the protocol. A Cardiac Risk Score, calculated using patient age and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by multiple-gated acquisition scan, statistically correlates with the risk of a CE.

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We identified 98 patients with DCIS in 2007. Of these, 63 underwent stereotactic biopsy, followed by MRI. There were 35 who underwent stereotactic biopsy alone. Concordance between MRI and histopathology was defined as the presence or absence of residual disease.",
        "Results/Findings": "There was no significant difference in mastectomy rates between the MRI and non-MRI group (20.3% vs 25.7%, P = .62). In patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), there were fewer positive margins in the MRI versus the non-MRI group (21.2% vs 30.8%, P = .41). Of the 64 cases that underwent preoperative MRI, 43 (67.2%) were concordant. Also, 15 of 43 cases (34.8%) had MRI results that accurately predicted pathologic size. In 28 of 43 patients (65.2%), MRI overestimated disease in 20, by a mean of 1.97 cm. In patients with MRI tumor size >2 cm, MRI overestimated disease by a mean of 3.17 cm. Of the 64 cases, 21 (32.8%) were discordant. Also, 10 of 21 (47.6%) had a positive MRI and no residual disease on histopathology, and 11 of 21 (52.3%) had negative MRI and residual disease on pathology.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "MRI does not accurately predict extent of disease in patients with extensive DCIS. In patients with MRI tumor size < or = 2 cm, MRI may assist in surgical planning. MRI results in patients with DCIS should be interpreted with caution; decision for mastectomy should not be made on MRI findings alone.",

        "Methods": "A retrospective review of National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data for 547,847 women with Stage I and Stage II breast cancer treated in US hospitals from 1985 to 1995 was undertaken. A subset of 47,944 Stage I and 23,283 Stage II women treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was identified. Cross-tab analysis was used to compare patterns of surgical care within this subset. Relative survival was calculated as the ratio of observed survival to the expected survival for women of the same age and racial/ethnic background.",
        "Results/Findings": "The rate of BCS with and without AND increased steadily from 17.6% and 6.4% of patients from 1985-1989, to 36.6% and 10.6% of patients from 1993-1995 respectively. AND was more likely to be omitted in women with Stage I than women with Stage II disease (14.5% versus 5.5%). Similarly, AND was omitted more frequently in women with Grade 1 than women with higher grades (Grade 1, 14.9%; Grade 2, 10.1%; Grade 3, 7.1%; Grade 4, 7%). Although the rate of BCS with AND varied considerably according to location in the breast, the overall rate of BCS without AND appeared independent of site of lesion. Women over the age of 70 years were more than twice as likely to have AND omitted from BCS than their younger counterparts. Women with lower incomes, women treated in the Northeast, or at hospitals with annual caseloads <150 were all less likely to undergo AND than their corresponding counterparts. Ten-year relative survival for Stage I women treated with partial mastectomy and AND was 85% (n = 1242) versus 66% (n = 1684) for comparable women in whom AND was omitted. BCS with AND followed by radiation therapy for Stage I disease resulted in 94% (n = 5469) 10-year relative survival, compared with 85% (n = 1284) without AND. Addition of both radiation and chemotherapy to BCS with AND for Stage I disease resulted in 86% (n = 2800) versus 58% (n = 512) without AND. In contrast, Stage II women treated with BCS with AND followed by radiation and chemotherapy experienced a 72% 10-year relative survival.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "A significant number of women with Stage I breast cancer do not undergo AND as part of BCS. The trend is most pronounced for the elderly, but significant fractions of women of all ages are also being undertreated by current standards. Ten-year survival is significantly worse when AND is omitted. This adverse survival effect is not solely from understaging.",

This was comprised of a critical histologic review and immunohistochemical evaluation to determine the status of prognostic and predictive markers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2/neu, Ki-67, and p53.",
        "Results/Findings": "The mean age at presentation was 33 years (range, 24-44 years). Densities and/or masses were noted on mammograms in 14 of 16 patients with available radiographic information. The primary tumors were a mean of 4.5 cm in greatest dimension (range, 0.1-13.5 cm). Two of the 39 patients had clinical (American Joint Committee on Cancer) Stage I disease, 19 patients had Stage II disease, 16 had Stage III disease, and 2 patients had Stage IV disease at the time of presentation. Histologically, high-grade invasive ductal carcinomas were found in 32 of 38 patients. The primary tumor was not available for review in one patient. A predominantly solid pattern of growth was observed in nine patients. Lymphovascular invasion was identified in 61% of cases. Ductal carcinoma in situ was identified in 72% of tumors and was high grade in all cases. Of the 25 patients tested, ER positivity was found in 7 patients, PR positivity was found in 6 patients, HER-2/neu positivity was found in 7 patients, and p53 positivity was found in 12 patients. The proliferation rate as shown by Ki-67 staining was high in 60% of the cases. Follow-up information was available for 35 patients and the mean follow-up period was 43 months (range, 2-163 months). Distant metastasis occurred in seven patients. The mean time to disease recurrence was 20.4 months (range, 10-33 months). Of 35 patients, 4 have died, 22 were alive with no evidence of disease, and 9 were alive with disease at the last follow-up. The remaining four patients died of unknown causes.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Pregnant women with breast carcinomas generally present with advanced-stage disease and the tumors have poor histologic and prognostic features. The findings from the follow-up indicated that these tumors do not follow a very aggressive clinical course as was proposed in earlier reports. Breast carcinomas occurring during pregnancy share many histologic and prognostic similarities with breast carcinoma occurring in other young women.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "We conducted a literature review using PubMed and secondary sources and examined 840 articles published between January 1990 and July 2010. Inclusion criteria for articles were 1) published in English after 1989; 2) exclusively analyzed female breast cancer survivors aged 50 years or younger or premenopausal at diagnosis, with baseline characteristics and/or quantitative or descriptive analyses for this age group; 3) investigated QOL (health-related QOL including physical functioning and mental health, depression, and anxiety), menopause- or fertility-related concerns, and weight gain or physical activity-related behavioral health outcomes. Data were extracted using a standardized table collecting the purpose, design, population, and results of each study. Extracted data were reviewed for accuracy by two investigators and presented as descriptive tables.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 28 articles met the inclusion criteria (15 cross-sectional studies, eight longitudinal studies, and five randomized trials). Regarding data review, no discordance between investigators was noted. Standardized measures of QOL and depressive symptoms identified worse outcomes as being more frequent or severe in breast cancer survivors aged 50 years or younger when compared with the general age-matched population of women without cancer and to older women (aged >50 years) with breast cancer. Concerns about premature menopause, menopausal symptoms, and infertility were common in younger women (aged ≤ 50 years) and had a role in the level of distress after treatment. Weight gain and physical inactivity were common health outcomes in younger women.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Younger women with breast cancer were found to experience distinct psychosocial and menopause-related concerns, weight gain, and physical inactivity. A need for more longitudinal research, including efforts at intervention to manage these symptoms and adverse health outcomes, remains.",

The review focuses on the current management of breast cancer in young women and the impact of treatment on reproductive function and subsequent management. With reference to key studies and meta-analyses, we highlight controversies and current unanswered questions regarding patient management.",

        "Methods": "We carried out a comprehensive review of reports documenting the use of taxanes, vinorelbine, trastuzumab and lapatinib during pregnancy in the English literature, in order to evaluate their safety profile in pregnant patients.",
        "Results/Findings": "Twenty-four pregnancies are described, in which no grade 3-4 maternal toxicity nor malformation in the offspring was reported. Whereas only one report studied the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel (Taxol) during pregnancy, several preclinical reports indicate that the placental P-glycoprotein could prevent the transplacental transfer of taxanes and vinorelbine. The use of trastuzumab was associated with the occurrence of anhydramnios in three of six cases.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The administration of recent drugs taxanes and vinorelbine seems feasible during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, with a favorable toxicity profile. In contrast, anti-HER-2 agents may obscure the normal development of the fetal kidney, and should be avoided during pregnancy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "To examine characteristics, treatment, and survival among men with newly diagnosed breast cancer, in 2003 and 2004, 512 men were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Data were reabstracted and therapy was verified through the patients' treating physicians.",
        "Results/Findings": "The majority of men (79%) were diagnosed through discovery of a breast lump or other signs/symptoms. Among men who had invasive disease, 86% underwent mastectomy, 37% received chemotherapy, and 58% received hormone therapy. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (P=.01) and positive lymph node status (P<.0001) were associated positively with the use of chemotherapy, whereas age group (P<.0001) and current unmarried status (P=.01) had negative associations. Among men who had invasive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/borderline tumors, the use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) was associated with age group (P=.05). Among men who had invasive disease, cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P<.0001). Among men with ER-positive/borderline disease, increased cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P<.0001), current unmarried status (P=.04), and decreased mortality with tamoxifen (P=.04).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Tumor characteristics and marital status were the primary predictors of therapy and cancer mortality among men with breast cancer. Although AIs are not currently recommended, they are commonly prescribed. However, their use did not result in a decrease in cancer mortality. Research must examine the efficacy of AIs with and without gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues.",

        "Methods": "We selected the study sample from 516 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer. For each diagnostic test (BS, LUS, CXR), we analyzed the prevalence defined as the number of patients with diagnosis of metastatic disease after an imaging technique divided by the total number of patients tested. In addition, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Initial suspicion was confirmed by other independent tests (bone X-ray, computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) in order to identify \"true\" positive diagnoses.",
        "Results/Findings": "At baseline, BS was carried out in 412 patients, LUS in 412 patients and CXR in 428 patients. Thirty-three patients were correctly diagnosed by the initial staging investigations as having metastatic disease (true positive cases). BS detected skeletal metastases in 6.31% of patients, LUS detected liver metastases in 0.72% of patients and CXR detected lung metastases in 0.93% of patients. Before imaging tests, all patients with either LUS or CXR evidence of metastases were previously classified as having stage III disease. On the other hand, only 26.9% of bone metastases were detected in patients with stage III. Accordingly, the detection rate in stage III patients was 14%, 5.6% and 7.2%, respectively for BS, LUS and CXR.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These findings indicate that a complete diagnostic work-up to detect metastases is unnecessary in the majority of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, whereas it may be indicated for specific patient categories such as those with stage III disease.",

Skeletal complications, including pathologic fractures, the need for radiation to bone or bone surgery, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia (a serum calcium concentration above 12 mg per deciliter [3.0 mmol per liter] or elevated to any degree and requiring treatment), were assessed monthly. Bone pain, use of analgesic drugs, performance status, and quality of life were assessed throughout the trial.",
        "Results/Findings": "The efficacy of treatment was evaluated in 380 of 382 randomized patients, 185 receiving pamidronate and 195 receiving placebo. The median time to the occurrence of the first skeletal complication was greater in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group (13.1 vs. 7.0 months, P=0.005), and the proportion of patients in whom any skeletal complication occurred was lower (43 percent vs. 56 percent, P = 0.008). There was significantly less increase in bone pain (P=0.046) and deterioration of performance status (P=0.027) in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group. Pamidronate was well tolerated.",

Primary outcomes were recurrence, distant recurrence, and breast cancer mortality. Primary subgroup investigations were site of first distant recurrence (bone or other), menopausal status (postmenopausal [combining natural and artificial] or not), and bisphosphonate class (aminobisphosphonate [eg, zoledronic acid, ibandronate, pamidronate] or other [ie, clodronate]). Intention-to-treat log-rank methods yielded bisphosphonate versus control first-event rate ratios (RRs).",
        "Results/Findings": "We received data on 18,766 women (18,206 [97%] in trials of 2-5 years of bisphosphonate) with median follow-up 5·6 woman-years, 3453 first recurrences, and 2106 subsequent deaths. Overall, the reductions in recurrence (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·87-1·01; 2p=0·08), distant recurrence (0·92, 0·85-0·99; 2p=0·03), and breast cancer mortality (0·91, 0·83-0·99; 2p=0·04) were of only borderline significance, but the reduction in bone recurrence was more definite (0·83, 0·73-0·94; 2p=0·004). Among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11 767 postmenopausal women it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·78-0·94; 2p=0·002), distant recurrence (0·82, 0·74-0·92; 2p=0·0003), bone recurrence (0·72, 0·60-0·86; 2p=0·0002), and breast cancer mortality (0·82, 0·73-0·93; 2p=0·002). Even for bone recurrence, however, the heterogeneity of benefit was barely significant by menopausal status (2p=0·06 for trend with menopausal status) or age (2p=0·03), and it was non-significant by bisphosphonate class, treatment schedule, oestrogen receptor status, nodes, tumour grade, or concomitant chemotherapy. No differences were seen in non-breast cancer mortality. Bone fractures were reduced (RR 0·85, 95% CI 0·75-0·97; 2p=0·02).",

Expression of H/I within primary tumors was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with a prespecified cutpoint. The predictive ability of H/I for ascertaining benefit from letrozole was determined using multivariable conditional logistic regression including standard clinicopathological factors as covariates. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "High H/I was statistically significantly associated with a decrease in late recurrence in patients receiving extended letrozole therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16 to 0.75; P = .007). In an adjusted model with standard clinicopathological factors, high H/I remained statistically significantly associated with patient benefit from letrozole (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.73; P = .006). Reduction in the absolute risk of recurrence at 5 years was 16.5% for patients with high H/I (P = .007). The interaction between H/I and letrozole treatment was statistically significant (P = .03).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In the absence of extended letrozole therapy, high H/I identifies a subgroup of ER-positive patients disease-free after 5 years of tamoxifen who are at risk for late recurrence.

        "Methods": "In this prospective comparison study, we obtained archival tumour blocks from the TransATAC tissue bank from all postmenopausal patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer from whom the 21-gene recurrence score and IHC4 values had already been derived. We did BCI analysis in matched samples with sufficient residual RNA using two BCI models-cubic (BCI-C) and linear (BCI-L)-using previously validated cutoffs. We assessed prognostic ability of BCI for distant recurrence over 10 years (the primary endpoint) and compared it with that of the 21-gene recurrence score and IHC4. We also tested the ability of the assays to predict early (0-5 years) and late (5-10 years) distant recurrence. To assess the ability of the biomarkers to predict recurrence beyond standard clinicopathological variables, we calculated the change in the likelihood-ratio χ(2) (LR-Δχ(2)) from Cox proportional hazards models.",
        "Results/Findings": "Suitable tissue was available from 665 patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive, N0 breast cancer for BCI analysis. The primary analysis showed significant differences in risk of distant recurrence over 10 years in the categorical BCI-C risk groups (p<0·0001) with 6·8% (95% CI 4·4-10·0) of patients in the low-risk group, 17·3% (12·0-24·7) in the intermediate group, and 22·2% (15·3-31·5) in the high-risk group having distant recurrence. The secondary analysis showed that BCI-L was a much stronger predictor for overall (0-10 year) distant recurrence compared with BCI-C (interquartile HR 2·30 [95% CI 1·62-3·27]; LR-Δχ(2)=22·69; p<0·0001). When compared with BCI-L, the 21-gene recurrence score was less predictive (HR 1·48 [95% CI 1·22-1·78]; LR-Δχ(2)=13·68; p=0·0002) and IHC4 was similar (HR 1·69 [95% CI 1·51-2·56]; LR-Δχ(2)=22·83; p<0·0001). All further analyses were done with the BCI-L model. In a multivariable analysis, all assays had significant prognostic ability for early distant recurrence (BCI-L HR 2·77 [95% CI 1·63-4·70], LR-Δχ(2)=15·42, p<0·0001; 21-gene recurrence score HR 1·80 [1·42-2·29], LR-Δχ(2)=18·48, p<0·0001; IHC4 HR 2·90 [2·01-4·18], LR-Δχ(2)=29·14, p<0·0001); however, only BCI-L was significant for late distant recurrence (BCI-L HR 1·95 [95% CI 1·22-3·14], LR-Δχ(2)=7·97, p=0·0048; 21-gene recurrence score HR 1·13 [0·82-1·56], LR-Δχ(2)=0·48, p=0·47; IHC4 HR 1·30 [0·88-1·94], LR-Δχ(2)=1·59, p=0·20).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "BCI-L was the only significant prognostic test for risk of both early and late distant recurrence and identified two risk populations for each timeframe. It could help to identify patients at high risk for late distant recurrence who might benefit from extended endocrine or other therapy.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "The BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 trial is ongoing at 118 hospitals in 11 countries. Women aged 18 years or older with completely excised non-low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned, by use of a minimisation algorithm, to tumour bed boost or no tumour bed boost, following conventional whole breast radiotherapy or hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using one of three randomisation categories. Category A was a 4-arm randomisation of tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) versus hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy (42·5 Gy in 16 fractions over 3·5 weeks). Category B was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy, and category C was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. Stratification factors were age at diagnosis, planned endocrine therapy, and treating centre. The primary endpoint, time to local recurrence, will be reported when participants have completed 5 years of follow-up. The HRQOL statistical analysis plan prespecified eight aspects of HRQOL, assessed by four questionnaires at baseline, end of treatment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after radiotherapy: fatigue and physical functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30); cosmetic status, breast-specific symptoms, arm and shoulder functional status (Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale); body image and sexuality (Body Image Scale); and perceived risk of invasive breast cancer (Cancer Worry Scale and a study-specific question). For each of these measures, tumour bed boost was compared with no boost, and conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy, by use of generalised estimating equation models. Analyses were by intention to treat, with Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between June 1, 2007, and Aug 14, 2013, 1208 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive no tumour bed boost (n=605) or tumour bed boost (n=603). 396 of 1208 women were assigned to category A: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=100) or no boost (n=98), or to hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=98) or no boost (n=100). 447 were assigned to category B: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=223) or no boost (n=224). 365 were assigned to category C: hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=182) or no boost (n=183). All patients were followed up at 2 years for the HRQOL analysis. 1098 (91%) of 1208 patients received their allocated treatment, and most completed their scheduled HRQOL assessments (1147 [95%] of 1208 at baseline; 988 [87%] of 1141 at 2 years). Cosmetic status was worse with tumour bed boost than with no boost across all timepoints (difference 0·10 [95% CI 0·05-0·15], global p=0·00014, Hochberg-adjusted p=0·0016); at the end of treatment, the estimated difference between tumour bed boost and no boost was 0·13 (95% CI 0·06-0·20; p=0·00021), persisting at 24 months (0·13 [0·06-0·20]; p=0·00021). Arm and shoulder function was also adversely affected by tumour bed boost across all timepoints (0·08 [95% CI 0·03-0·13], global p=0·0033, Hochberg adjusted p=0·045); the difference between tumour bed boost and no boost at the end of treatment was 0·08 (0·01 to 0·15, p=0·021), and did not persist at 24 months (0·04 [-0·03 to 0·11], p=0·29). None of the other six prespecified aspects of HRQOL differed significantly after adjustment for multiple testing. Conventional whole breast radiotherapy was associated with worse body image than hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy at the end of treatment (difference -1·10 [95% CI -1·79 to -0·42], p=0·0016). No significant differences were reported in the other PROs between conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy.",

        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI can result in additional detection of otherwise occult lesions in occult breast cancer. Because of low specificity of malignant lesion detection by breast MRI, lesions should be histologically confirmed. This can be achieved either by MRI or ultrasound guided biopsy, as long as all MRI detected lesions are histologically checked.

OS was analyzed using an unadjusted log-rank test. No adjustments were made for multiplicity. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and best response to subsequent therapy were also reported. All statistical tests were two-sided.",
        "Results/Findings": "In total, 736 women (median age = 61.0 years) were randomly assigned to fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 362) or 250 mg (n = 374). At the final survival analysis, 554 of 736 (75.3%) patients had died. Median OS was 26.4 months for fulvestrant 500 mg and 22.3 months for 250 mg (hazard ratio = 0.81; 95% confidence interval = 0.69-0.96; nominal P = .02). There were no clinically important differences in SAE profiles between the treatment groups; no clustering of SAEs could be detected in either treatment group.

All patients had pathologic confirmation of typical Paget cells at time of diagnosis. Thirty-six of 38 patients had a minimum follow-up greater than 12 months and constitute the study cohort. Ninety-four percent of patients underwent complete or partial excision of the nipple-areola complex and all patients received a median external beam irradiation dose of 50 Gy (range, 45-54 Gy) to the whole breast. Ninety-seven percent of patients also received a boost to the remaining nipple or tumor bed, a median total dose of 61.5 Gy (range, 50.4-70 Gy).",
        "Results/Findings": "With median follow-up of 113 months (range, 18-257 months), 4 of 36 patients (11%) developed a first recurrence of disease in the treated breast only. Two of the four recurrences in the breast were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only and two were invasive with DCIS. Two additional patients had a recurrence in the breast as a component of first failure. Actuarial local control rates for the breast as the only site of first recurrence were 91% at 5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 80-100%) and 87% (95% CI, 75-99%) at both 10 and 15 years. Actuarial local control rates for breast recurrence, as a component of first failure, were 91% (95% CI, 80-100%), 83% (95% CI, 69-97%), and 76% (95% CI, 58-94%) at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. No clinical factors were identified as significant predictors for breast recurrence. Five-, 10- and 15-year actuarial rates for survival without disease of 97% (95% CI, 90-100%) and 5-, 10-, and 15-year actuarial rates of overall survival of 93% (95% CI, 84-100%) at 5 years and 90% (95% CI, 78-100%) at 10 and 15 years were reported.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "These data confirm excellent rates of local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival at 10 and 15 years following BCS and RT for Paget disease of the breast.

All women who delivered had live births. One child has Down syndrome and 2 have congenital anomalies (club foot; congenital bilateral ureteral reflux). The children are healthy and those in school are doing well, although 2 have special educational needs.",

        "Results/Findings": "In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease (n=10,645), allocation to about 5 years of tamoxifen substantially reduced recurrence rates throughout the first 10 years (RR 0·53 [SE 0·03] during years 0-4 and RR 0·68 [0·06] during years 5-9 [both 2p<0·00001]; but RR 0·97 [0·10] during years 10-14, suggesting no further gain or loss after year 10). Even in marginally ER-positive disease (10-19 fmol/mg cytosol protein) the recurrence reduction was substantial (RR 0·67 [0·08]). In ER-positive disease, the RR was approximately independent of progesterone receptor status (or level), age, nodal status, or use of chemotherapy. Breast cancer mortality was reduced by about a third throughout the first 15 years (RR 0·71 [0·05] during years 0-4, 0·66 [0·05] during years 5-9, and 0·68 [0·08] during years 10-14; p<0·0001 for extra mortality reduction during each separate time period). Overall non-breast-cancer mortality was little affected, despite small absolute increases in thromboembolic and uterine cancer mortality (both only in women older than 55 years), so all-cause mortality was substantially reduced. In ER-negative disease, tamoxifen had little or no effect on breast cancer recurrence or mortality.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen safely reduces 15-year risks of breast cancer recurrence and death. ER status was the only recorded factor importantly predictive of the proportional reductions. Hence, the absolute risk reductions produced by tamoxifen depend on the absolute breast cancer risks (after any chemotherapy) without tamoxifen.",

        "Methods": "We reviewed a database of over 3,000 patients treated from 1965 to 2003 to identify our cohort of premenopausal women who underwent breast-conserving therapy and subsequently sustained full-term pregnancies. Lactation outcome parameters (breast swelling, ability to lactate, and volume of lactation in the treated and untreated breasts) were the main outcome measures.",
        "Results/Findings": "We identified 28 pregnancies in 21 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years. One patient underwent bilateral breast treatment; therefore, a total of 22 breasts were irradiated. All patients interviewed reported little or no swelling of the treated breast during pregnancy. Of the patients studied, 4 (18.2%) elected pharmacological suppression of lactation. Of the remaining 18 breasts, lactation occurred in 10 (55.6%), did not occur in 7 (38.9%) and was unknown for 1 (5.5%). The volume was reported as significantly diminished in 80% of breasts treated. Lactation in the contralateral breast occurred in all patients who did not undergo pharmacological suppression.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Patients can experience successful lactation in the contralateral, untreated breast after breast-conserving therapy. In the treated breast, functional lactation is possible but is significantly diminished in the majority of patients.",

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive goserelin 3·6 mg/month plus either anastrozole 1 mg per day and tamoxifen placebo or tamoxifen 20 mg per day and anastrozole placebo for 24 weeks before surgery. Patients were randomised sequentially, stratified by centre, with randomisation codes. All study personnel were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was best overall tumour response (complete response or partial response), assessed by callipers, during the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period for the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was analysed for non-inferiority (with non-inferiority defined as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in overall response rates between groups being 10% or less); in the event of non-inferiority, we assessed the superiority of the anastrozole group versus the tamoxifen group. We included all patients who received study medication at least once in the safety analysis set. We report the primary analysis; treatment will also continue in the adjuvant setting for 5 years.

        "Methods": "We collected information concerning patients treated with anthracyclines during pregnancy from a review of literature between 1976 and 2001 and our experience. The events analyzed were malformations, fetal death and spontaneous abortion. A chi(2) test with a Yates correction was used to compare the distribution of severe events.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 160 patient pregnancies were analyzed. The fetal outcome was frequently normal (73%). Abnormalities included malformations (3%), fetal death (9%), spontaneous abortion (3%), fetal complications (8%) and prematurity (6%). Fetal death was often directly consecutive to maternal death (40%). Unfavorable fetal outcome was significantly more frequent in leukemia patients (P = 0.001). In patients with solid tumors, the first trimester was significantly associated with more complications (P = 0.029). The risk of severe fetal toxicity was increased 30-fold when the dose of doxorubicin per cycle exceeded 70 mg/m(2) (P = 0.037).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Anthracyclines may induce embryo-fetal toxicity. Nevertheless the risk seems low, especially after the first trimester and using doses of doxorubicin below 70 mg/m(2).",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In a retrospective analysis, outcomes data were extracted for patients receiving tv as their only chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting at the Jewish General Hospital. For the most part, tv was administered weekly for 6 months, followed by trastuzumab for 6 months.",
        "Results/Findings": "The analysis identified 46 patients (mean age: 64 years) who received tv between 2003 and 2012 (n = 36 adjuvant, n = 10 neoadjuvant). Of the patients in the adjuvant group, 81% had stage i disease. In the neoadjuvant group, 3 patients experienced a complete pathologic response. Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence after a short course (3 months) of adjuvant tv. Overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival were 94% and 98% respectively at a median 5 years of follow-up. Febrile neutropenia-induced sepsis resulted in the death of 1 patient with significant medical comorbidities; 2 other patients died of comorbidities unrelated to their cancer or treatment. Grades 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (23%), febrile neutropenia (10%), fatigue (2%), and anemia (2%).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "For patients with non-metastatic breast cancer refusing alopecia, or for patients who are not candidates for standard chemotherapy, tv is a reasonable alternative to standard adjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "Methods": "In the prospective multicentric SN FNAC study, patients with biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer (T0-3, N1-2) underwent both SNB and CND. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) use was mandatory, and SN metastases of any size, including isolated tumor cells (ypN0[i+], ≤ 0.2 mm), were considered positive. The optimal SNB identification rate (IR) ≥ 90% and false-negative rate (FNR) ≤ 10% were predetermined.",
        "Results/Findings": "From March 2009 to December 2012, 153 patients were accrued to the study. The SNB IR was 87.6% (127 of 145; 95% CI, 82.2% to 93.0%), and the FNR was 8.4% (seven of 83; 95% CI, 2.4% to 14.4%). If SN ypN0(i+)s had been considered negative, the FNR would have increased to 13.3% (11 of 83; 95% CI, 6.0% to 20.6%). There was no correlation between size of SN metastases and rate of positive non-SNs. Using this method, 30.3% of patients could potentially avoid CND.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "In biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer after NAC, a low SNB FNR (8.4%) can be achieved with mandatory use of IHC. SN metastases of any size should be considered positive. The SNB IR was 87.6%, and in the presence of a technical failure, axillary node dissection should be performed. We recommend that SN evaluation with IHC be further evaluated before being included in future guidelines on the use of SNB after NAC in this setting.",

        "Methods": "We randomly assigned patients to receive either ribociclib or placebo in addition to endocrine therapy (goserelin and either a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen). Overall survival was evaluated with the use of a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods.",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 672 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. There were 83 deaths among 335 patients (24.8%) in the ribociclib group and 109 deaths among 337 patients (32.3%) in the placebo group. The addition of ribociclib to endocrine therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than endocrine therapy alone. The estimated overall survival at 42 months was 70.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.5 to 76.0) in the ribociclib group and 46.0% (95% CI, 32.0 to 58.9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; P = 0.00973 by log-rank test). The survival benefit seen in the subgroup of 495 patients who received an aromatase inhibitor was consistent with that in the overall intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.98). The percentage of patients who received subsequent antineoplastic therapy was balanced between the groups (68.9% in the ribociclib group and 73.2% in the placebo group). The time from randomization to disease progression during receipt of second-line therapy or to death was also longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87).",

A greater proportion of patients underwent lumpectomy later in the study period (1983 to 1986, 10.6 %, vs. 2007 to 2009, 15.1 %). A greater percentage of lumpectomy patients were 80 years or older (21.3 % vs. 16.3 %), had stage IV disease (7.3 % vs. 3.1 %), and received no lymph node sampling (34.3 % vs. 6.9 %). Only 35.4 % of patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy. Ten-year breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival were 82.8 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in lumpectomy patients vs. 77.3 % and 46.4 %, respectively, in mastectomy patients. On Cox proportional hazards regression, lumpectomy was not independently associated with worse breast cancer-specific survival (odds ratio 1.09, 95 % confidence interval 0.87-1.37) or overall survival (odds ratio 1.12, 95 % confidence interval 0.98-1.27) after controlling for age, race, stage, and grade, as well as whether radiotherapy was received.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Lumpectomy is performed in a small but growing proportion of MBC patients. These patients are not only older and more likely to have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, but they also are less likely to receive standard of care therapy, such as lymph node sampling and adjuvant radiotherapy. Despite these observations, breast cancer-specific survival is unaffected by the type of surgery.",

        "Methods": "From 1995 to 2001, 69 patients at our institution presented with occult primary breast cancer. All patients had negative breast examinations and mammograms and underwent breast MRI.",
        "Results/Findings": "Of 69 patients, 55 had axillary adenopathy without evidence of distant disease (stage II); 14 had stage IV disease. In patients with stage II disease, MRI revealed suspicious lesions in 76% (42 of 55). In 62% (26 of 42), the MRI finding proved to be the occult primary tumor. Of these, 58% (15 of 26) were candidates for breast conservation. MRI did not identify the primary tumor in 25 women; 12 underwent mastectomy. Cancer was found in 33% (4 of 12) of these. Thirteen patients were treated with primary breast irradiation; three were lost to follow-up, one developed distant disease, and nine were without evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. In women with stage IV disease, MRI identified the primary tumor in 5 of 9 patients with regional adenopathy and 2 of 5 patients with distant disease (overall 50%; 7 of 14). MRI identified the primary tumor in women with both mammographically dense (19 of 44; 43%) and less dense (10 of 20; 50%) breasts.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Breast MRI detects mammographically occult cancer in half of women with axillary metastases, regardless of breast density. MRI is a powerful tool for stage II and stage IV patients with occult primary breast cancer.",

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive capivasertib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. The dual primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival assessed both in the overall population and among patients with AKT pathway-altered ( ,  , or  ) tumors. Safety was assessed.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, 708 patients underwent randomization; 289 patients (40.8%) had AKT pathway alterations, and 489 (69.1%) had received a CDK4/6 inhibitor previously for advanced breast cancer. In the overall population, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 3.6 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.71; P<0.001).

The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or higher in patients receiving capivasertib-fulvestrant were rash (in 12.1% of patients, vs. in 0.3% of those receiving placebo-fulvestrant) and diarrhea (in 9.3% vs. 0.3%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 13.0% of the patients receiving capivasertib and in 2.3% of those receiving placebo.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Capivasertib-fulvestrant therapy resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than treatment with fulvestrant alone among patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer whose disease had progressed during or after previous aromatase inhibitor therapy with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

        "Methods": "We undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data for 10,801 women in 17 randomised trials of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, 8337 of whom had pathologically confirmed node-negative (pN0) or node-positive (pN+) disease.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall, radiotherapy reduced the 10-year risk of any (ie, locoregional or distant) first recurrence from 35·0% to 19·3% (absolute reduction 15·7%, 95% CI 13·7-17·7, 2p<0·00001) and reduced the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 25·2% to 21·4% (absolute reduction 3·8%, 1·6-6·0, 2p=0·00005). In women with pN0 disease (n=7287), radiotherapy reduced these risks from 31·0% to 15·6% (absolute recurrence reduction 15·4%, 13·2-17·6, 2p<0·00001) and from 20·5% to 17·2% (absolute mortality reduction 3·3%, 0·8-5·8, 2p=0·005), respectively. In these women with pN0 disease, the absolute recurrence reduction varied according to age, grade, oestrogen-receptor status, tamoxifen use, and extent of surgery, and these characteristics were used to predict large (≥20%), intermediate (10-19%), or lower (<10%) absolute reductions in the 10-year recurrence risk. Absolute reductions in 15-year risk of breast cancer death in these three prediction categories were 7·8% (95% CI 3·1-12·5), 1·1% (-2·0 to 4·2), and 0·1% (-7·5 to 7·7) respectively (trend in absolute mortality reduction 2p=0·03). In the few women with pN+ disease (n=1050), radiotherapy reduced the 10-year recurrence risk from 63·7% to 42·5% (absolute reduction 21·2%, 95% CI 14·5-27·9, 2p<0·00001) and the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 51·3% to 42·8% (absolute reduction 8·5%, 1·8-15·2, 2p=0·01). Overall, about one breast cancer death was avoided by year 15 for every four recurrences avoided by year 10, and the mortality reduction did not differ significantly from this overall relationship in any of the three prediction categories for pN0 disease or for pN+ disease.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy to the conserved breast halves the rate at which the disease recurs and reduces the breast cancer death rate by about a sixth. These proportional benefits vary little between different groups of women. By contrast, the absolute benefits from radiotherapy vary substantially according to the characteristics of the patient and they can be predicted at the time when treatment decisions need to be made.",

        "Methods": "This study is an open-label, randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial. Patients were recruited from 152 centres in the UK. We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, aged 18 years or older, and with a clear indication for chemotherapy, by a computerised minimisation process (1:1), to receive either 6-month or 12-month trastuzumab delivered every 3 weeks intravenously (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (600 mg), given in combination with chemotherapy (concurrently or sequentially). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat, with a non-inferiority margin of 3% for 4-year disease-free survival. Safety was analysed in all patients who received trastuzumab. This trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2006-007018-39), ISRCTN (number 52968807), and ClinicalTrials.gov (number  ).",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Oct 4, 2007, and July 31, 2015, 2045 patients were assigned to 12-month trastuzumab treatment and 2044 to 6-month treatment (one patient was excluded because they were double randomised). Median follow-up was 5·4 years (IQR 3·6-6·7) for both treatment groups, during which a disease-free survival event occurred in 265 (13%) of 2043 patients in the 6-month group and 247 (12%) of 2045 patients in the 12-month group. 4-year disease-free survival was 89·4% (95% CI 87·9-90·7) in the 6-month group and 89·8% (88·3-91·1) in the 12-month group (hazard ratio 1·07 [90% CI 0·93-1·24], non-inferiority p=0·011), showing non-inferiority of the 6-month treatment. 6-month trastuzumab treatment resulted in fewer patients reporting severe adverse events (373 [19%] of 1939 patients vs 459 [24%] of 1894 patients, p=0·0002) or stopping early because of cardiotoxicity (61 [3%] of 1939 patients vs 146 [8%] of 1894 patients, p<0·0001).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "We have shown that 6-month trastuzumab treatment is non-inferior to 12-month treatment in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, with less cardiotoxicity and fewer severe adverse events. These results support consideration of reduced duration trastuzumab for women at similar risk of recurrence as to those included in the trial.",

        "Results/Findings": "The risk for major infections that required prosthesis removal was elevated in the acellular dermal matrix group (4.9 versus 2.5 percent), but this increase did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.172). There was a statistically significant increase in overall wound infection rate in the acellular dermal matrix group (6.8 versus 2.5 percent, p = 0.031), but in a multivariate analysis, the use of acellular dermal matrix did not materialize as a significant risk factor for overall wound infection. Overall surgical complication rate was significantly higher in the acellular dermal matrix group at 19.5 percent, compared with the non-acellular dermal matrix group at 12.3 percent (p < 0.001).

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Breast carcinoma samples from 60 women with known HER-2 status in both primary tumors and paired metastases (locoregional disease, n = 43 patients; distant disease, n = 17 patients) were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-two patients underwent chemotherapy before their metastatic lesions were sampled, including 18 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 14 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. The HER-2 gene was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization either in paraffin-embedded tissue samples (48 primary tumors and 9 metastatic tumors) or in fine-needle aspirates (12 primary tumors and 51 metastatic tumors). HER-2 gene amplification was defined as a HER-2:chromosome 17 signal ratio >/= 2.0.",
        "Results/Findings": "The HER-2 status of primary and metastatic tumors agreed in 58 of 60 patients (97%), including 18 (30%) amplified tumors and 40 (67%) nonamplified tumors. A discrepancy in HER-2 status was observed in specimens from two patients in which HER-2 amplification was detected in the primary tumor but not the metastatic tumors. In one patient, three foci of tumor nodules were found in the same breast; the HER-2 status was assessed in only one of them, which showed amplification; however, HER-2 amplification was not detected in the axillary lymph node metastasis. In another patient, the HER-2 gene was amplified in the primary tumor but not in the liver metastasis. No metastases showed HER-2 amplification without amplification in the primary tumor. Locoregional and distant metastases demonstrated similar concordance rates with their corresponding primary tumors (98% and 94%, respectively). Complete concordance of HER-2 status was found between primary tumors prior to chemotherapy and metastases that were sampled after chemotherapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The HER-2 status in breast carcinoma generally was stable during metastasis, whether to locoregional or distant sites. Chemotherapy did not modify the HER-2 status in metastatic lesions. Therefore, HER-2 amplification can be evaluated reliably in material from either primary or metastatic tumors in most patients. Further study with larger series is warranted to elucidate the significance of discordant results.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "This study was performed at the University of Florence (Florence, Italy). Women aged more than 40years affected by early BC, with a maximum pathological tumour size of 25mm, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either WBI or APBI using IMRT. Patients in the APBI arm received a total dose of 30 Gy to the tumour bed in five daily fractions. The WBI arm received 50Gy in 25 fractions, followed by a boost on the tumour bed of 10Gy in five fractions. The primary end-point was occurrence of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrences (IBTRs); the main analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  .",
        "Results/Findings": "A total of 520 patients were randomised (260 to external WBI and 260 to APBI with IMRT) between March 2005 and June 2013. At a median follow-up of 5.0 years (Interquartile Range (IQR) 3.4-7.0), the IBTR rate was 1.5% (three cases) in the APBI group (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-3.0) and in the WBI group (three cases; 95% CI 0.0-2.8). No significant difference emerged between the two groups (log rank test p=0.86). We identified seven deaths in the WBI group and only one in the APBI group (p=0.057). The 5-year overall survival was 96.6% for the WBI group and 99.4% for the APBI group. The APBI group presented significantly better results considering acute (p=0.0001), late (p=0.004), and cosmetic outcome (p=0.045).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "To our knowledge, this is the first randomised study using the IMRT technique for APBI delivery. No significant difference in terms of IBTR and overall survival was observed between the two arms. APBI displayed a significantly better toxicity profile.",

        "Methods": "Sixty-three women with histologically confirmed and measurable MBC received 300 mg/m2 ABI-007 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks without premedication. Forty-eight patients received prior chemotherapy; 39 patients received no prior treatment for metastatic disease.",
        "Results/Findings": "Overall response rates (complete or partial responses) were 48% (95% CI, 35.3% to 60.0%) for all patients.

Median time to disease progression was 26.6 weeks, and median survival was 63.6 weeks. No severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported despite the lack of premedication. Toxicities observed were typical of paclitaxel and included grade 4 neutropenia (24%), grade 3 sensory neuropathy (11%), and grade 4 febrile neutropenia (5%).

Overall, relapse-free, distant disease-free, and local/regional-free patient survival data were available on 1,123 of these tumors. IHC scoring for ErbB-2 status (HercepTest; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was performed on adjacent sections of 151 cases, and receptor functionality was measured in 230 tumors by an antibody specific for phosphorylated (Y1248-P) ErbB-2.",
        "Results/Findings": "Unlike nonmalignant breast tissues, breast tumors showed increased ErbB-2 levels in a bimodal distribution, with 12% constituting a distinct set of ErbB-2-overexpressing tumors. The intermodal threshold value for ErbB-2 overexpression distinguished tumors with reduced estrogen and progesterone receptor content, high IHC score for ErbB-2, and significantly increased levels of phosphorylated (Y1248-P) ErbB-2 receptor. By multivariate analysis, EIA-determined ErbB-2 overexpression predicted significantly reduced patient survival that was unaffected by tamoxifen or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil adjuvant therapy.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Determination of ErbB-2 receptor expression by EIA offers a clinically valuable alternative to semiquantitative IHC assessment of breast tumor ErbB-2 overexpression and affords the opportunity to evaluate ErbB-2 phosphorylation, which may represent an important predictive parameter of receptor functionality.",

In total, 207 and 201 patients were enrolled to combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively. Thirty-six patients receiving monotherapy crossed over to combination therapy following enrollment termination. The median overall survival times were 75.0 weeks for the combination arm and 64.7 weeks for the monotherapy arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.08; p = .210). A Cox regression analysis considering crossover as a time-dependent covariate suggested a 20% lower risk for death for patients treated with combination therapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99; p = .043). The low incidence of serious adverse events was consistent with previously reported rates.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Although premature enrollment termination and subsequent crossover resulted in insufficient power to detect differences in overall survival, exploratory analyses demonstrate a trend toward a survival advantage with lapatinib plus capecitabine. These data continue to support the efficacy of lapatinib in patients with HER-2(+) MBC.",

        "es_title": "Palbociclib and Letrozole in Advanced Breast Cancer",
        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 666 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, who had not had prior treatment for advanced disease, to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigators; secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, clinical benefit response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetic effects, and safety.",
        "Results/Findings": "The median progression-free survival was 24.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to not estimable) in the palbociclib-letrozole group, as compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9 to 17.1) in the placebo-letrozole group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (occurring in 66.4% of the patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group vs. 1.4% in the placebo-letrozole group), leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in none of the patients in the placebo-letrozole group. Permanent discontinuation of any study treatment as a result of adverse events occurred in 43 patients (9.7%) in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in 13 patients (5.9%) in the placebo-letrozole group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Among patients with previously untreated ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, palbociclib combined with letrozole resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than that with letrozole alone, although the rates of myelotoxic effects were higher with palbociclib-letrozole.

        "es_title": "The UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) trials of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: 10 -year follow -up results of two randomised controlled trials",
        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "From 1999 to 2002, women with completely excised invasive breast cancer (pT1-3a, pN0-1, M0) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment (where prescribed). Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre, type of primary surgery (breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy), and tumour bed boost radiotherapy. In START-A, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 41·6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. In START-B, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction. Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects. Analysis was by intention to treat. Follow-up data are still being collected. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779.",
        "Results/Findings": "START-A enrolled 2236 women. Median follow-up was 9·3 years (IQR 8·0-10·0), after which 139 local-regional relapses had occurred. 10-year rates of local-regional relapse did not differ significantly between the 41·6 Gy and 50 Gy regimen groups (6·3%, 95% CI 4·7-8·5 vs 7·4%, 5·5-10·0; hazard ratio [HR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·59-1·38; p=0·65) or the 39 Gy (8·8%, 95% CI 6·7-11·4) and 50 Gy regimen groups (HR 1·18, 95% CI 0·79-1·76; p=0·41). In START-A, moderate or marked breast induration, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Normal tissue effects did not differ significantly between 41·6 Gy and 50 Gy groups. START-B enrolled 2215 women. Median follow-up was 9·9 years (IQR 7·5-10·1), after which 95 local-regional relapses had occurred. The proportion of patients with local-regional relapse at 10 years did not differ significantly between the 40 Gy group (4·3%, 95% CI 3·2-5·9) and the 50 Gy group (5·5%, 95% CI 4·2-7·2; HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·51-1·16; p=0·21). In START-B, breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 40 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "Long-term follow-up confirms that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy is safe and effective for patients with early breast cancer. The results support the continued use of 40 Gy in 15 fractions, which has already been adopted by most UK centres as the standard of care for women requiring adjuvant radiotherapy for invasive early breast cancer.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "EORTC 22922/10925, a randomised, phase 3 trial done across 46 radiation oncology departments from 13 countries, included women up to 75 years of age with unilateral, histologically confirmed, stage I-III breast adenocarcinoma with involved axillary nodes or a central or medially located primary tumour. Surgery consisted of mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and axillary staging. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using minimisation to receive IM-MS irradiation at 50 Gy in 25 fractions (IM-MS irradiation group) or no IM-MS irradiation (control group). Stratification was done for institution, menopausal status, site of the primary tumour within the breast, type of breast and axillary surgery, and pathological T and N stage. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, breast cancer mortality, any breast cancer recurrence, and cause of death. Follow-up is ongoing for 20 years after randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  .",
        "Results/Findings": "Between Aug 5, 1996, and Jan 13, 2004, we enrolled 4004 patients, of whom 2002 were randomly assigned to the IM-MS irradiation group and 2002 to the no IM-MS irradiation group. At a median follow-up of 15·7 years (IQR 14·0-17·6), 554 (27·7%) patients in the IM-MS irradiation group and 569 (28·4%) patients in the control group had died. Overall survival was 73·1% (95% CI 71·0-75·2) in the IM-MS irradiation group and 70·9% (68·6-72·9) in the control group (HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·84-1·06], p=0·36). Any breast cancer recurrence (24·5% [95% CI 22·5-26·6] vs 27·1% [25·1-29·2]; HR 0·87 [95% CI 0·77-0·98], p=0·024) and breast cancer mortality (16·0% [14·3-17·7] vs 19·8% [18·0-21·7]; 0·81 [0·70-0·94], p=0·0055) were lower in the IM-MS irradiation group than in the control group. No significant differences in the IM-MS irradiation group versus the control group were seen for disease-free survival (60·8% [95% CI 58·4-63·2] vs 59·9% [57·5-62·2]; HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·84-1·03], p=0·18), or distant metastasis-free survival (70·0% [67·7-72·2] vs 68·2% [65·9-70·3]; 0·93 [0·83-1·04], p=0·18). Causes of death between groups were similar.",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "The 15-year results show a significant reduction of breast cancer mortality and any breast cancer recurrence by IM-MS irradiation in stage I-III breast cancer. However, this is not converted to improved overall survival.",

        "Background/Purpose": "",
        "Methods": "Patients with histopathological diagnosis of TNBC without evidence of distant metastases who were planned to be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were randomized to experimental or control arms after stratification by menopausal status (premenopausal or perimenopausal, and postmenopausal) and stage [operable breast cancer (OBC, clinical T1-3, N0-1, M0), and locally advanced breast cancer (LABC, cT4 or N2-3, M0)]. NACT in control arm included paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 once per week for 8 weeks followed by doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (90 mg/m2) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) once every 21 days for 4 cycles while in experimental arm carboplatin (area-under-curve 2) was added once per week for 8 weeks with paclitaxel. After NACT patients received standard surgery for primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (LN) followed by radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), pathological complete response (pCR, absence of invasive cancer from breast and LN), and toxicity.",
        "Results/Findings": "Between April 2010 and January 2020, 720 (355 control, 365 experimental) patients with a median age of 46 (25-69) years [< 50 years, 502 (69.7%), premenopausal 418 (58.2%)], were included in the study, of whom 285 (39.6%) had OBC and 435 (60.4%) had LABC, with a median clinical tumor size of 6.0 (1.2- 20.0) cm. At a median follow-up of 67.6 (18.9-142.2) months, in the experimental and control arms, the 5-year DFS were 70.6% (95% CI 65.7-75.5%) and 64.5% (95% CI 59.4-69.6%), respectively (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02, p=0.073), 5-year OS were 74.0 (95% CI 69.3-78.7%) and 66.7% (95% CI 61.6-71.8%), respectively (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.98, p=0.034), and pCR were 55.2% (95% CI 49.7-69.5%) and 41.5% (95% CI 36.2-47.0%), respectively (p=0.0004). In subgroup analyses, the benefit of carboplatin was confined to patient’s < 50 years, with significant interaction between treatment and age. In women < 50 years of age, in experimental versus control arms, 5-year DFS and OS were 74.5% vs 62.3% (p=0.003, interaction p=0.003) and 76.8% vs 65.7% (p=0.003, interaction p=0.004), respectively. Addition of carboplatin had a significant beneficial impact on OS after adjusting for baseline clinical tumor size and age in a Cox model (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.98, p=0.038). In experimental and control arms, numbers of patients with any grade >/=3 toxicity were 140 (38.5%) and 107/355 (30.14%), respectively, (p=0.02), grade >/=3 neutropenia were 2/364 (0.55%) and 1/355 (0.28%), respectively, grade >/=3 thrombocytopenia were 1/364 (0.27%) and 0 (0%), respectively, and febrile neutropenia were 26/364 (7.14%%) and 18/355 (5.07%), respectively (p=0.25).",
        "Conclusion/Interpretation": "This study, to our knowledge the largest reported trial of neoadjuvant platinum in TNBC thus far, suggests that addition of carboplatin to sequential taxane-anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in substantial and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free and overall survival in young patients with TNBC and should be the standard of care in these patients.",

        "Results/Findings": "Between October 2015 and April 2021, 153 patients were enrolled (N=80 FD, N=73 SD). 78% were hormone receptor positive/HER-2 negative, 11% each were HER-2 positive and triple negative. The 3-month PFS was 76% in the FD arm and 76% in the SD arm (HR=1.01; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.94; p=0.99). Landmark analysis of PFS at 12, 24 and 36 months is reported. Non-proportional hazards were detected, so restricted mean survival time (RMST) was used to report estimates of effect.

Secondary endpoints include response, safety (including cardiac events), and tolerability. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is monitored by echocardiogram every 3 mo. Cardiac events are defined as symptomatic LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD), non-LVSD cardiac death, or probable cardiac death.",

Patients received 500 mg IV of dostarlimab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then 1000 mg IV every 6 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by RECIST v1.1.

Responses were durable, and median DOR has not been reached in either cohort (median follow-up: cohort A1, 16.3 months; cohort F, 12.4 months). A total of 267 patients were included in the safety population (all patients who received ≥1 dose; cohort A1, N = 126; cohort F, N = 141). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were consistent across tumor types. Overall, the most frequently reported any-grade TRAEs were asthenia (13.9%), diarrhea (13.5%), and fatigue (11.2%).
