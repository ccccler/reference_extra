        "abstract": "Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent, potentially long-lasting side effect of select chemotherapies. It contributes to suboptimal chemotherapy dosing, and its symptoms negatively impact patients' quality of life. To date, interventions to effectively prevent this toxicity have not been established, and interventions to treat CIPN have produced only modest results. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine the impact of regional cooling applied to distal extremities on the severity of CIPN. A literature review was performed using SCOPUS and PubMed databases. The search was not restricted by date but was restricted to English language. Forty-two articles were identified in the search, and six were included in the review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results related to protective effects from peripheral cooling against CIPN were variable. Four out of six studies demonstrated benefit of peripheral cooling in reducing the severity of CIPN. There was evidence to suggest that applying a relatively greater degree of cooling compared with a lesser degree may confer benefit in reducing the severity of CIPN. Both direct application of cooling and use of compression to achieve fingertip cooling showed potential benefit.",

        "abstract": "Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting and disabling side effect of taxane anticancer agents. We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of cryotherapy for CIPN prevention. Methods: Breast cancer patients treated weekly with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 for one hour) wore frozen gloves and socks on the dominant side for 90 minutes, including the entire duration of drug infusion. Symptoms on the treated sides were compared with those on the untreated (nondominant) sides. The primary end point was CIPN incidence assessed by changes in tactile sensitivity from pretreatment baseline in a monofilament test at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2. We also assessed thermosensory deficits, subjective symptoms (Patient Neuropathy Questionnaire [PNQ]), manipulative dexterity, and the time to events and hazard ratio by PNQ. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among the 40 patients, four did not reach the cumulative dose (due to the occurrence of pneumonia, severe fatigue, severe liver dysfunction, and macular edema), leaving 36 patients for analysis. None dropped out due to cold intolerance. The incidence of objective and subjective CIPN signs was clinically and statistically significantly lower on the intervention side than on the control (hand: tactile sensitivity = 27.8% vs 80.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 20.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.20 to 828.96, P < .001; foot: tacile sensitivity = 25.0% vs 63.9%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; hand: warm sense = 8.8% vs 32.4%, OR = 9.00, 95% CI = 1.25 to 394.48, P = .02; foot: warm sense: 33.4% vs 57.6%, OR = 5.00, 95% CI = 1.07 to 46.93, P = .04; hand: PNQ = 2.8% vs 41.7%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; foot: PNQ = 2.8% vs 36.1%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 2.78 to infinite, P < .001; hand: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.34; foot: HR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.38, dexterity mean delay = -2.5 seconds, SD = 12.0 seconds, vs + 8.6 seconds, SD = 25.8 seconds, P = .005). Conclusion: Cryotherapy is useful for preventing both the objective and subjective symptoms of CIPN and resultant dysfunction.",
