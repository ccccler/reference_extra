        "Abstract Note": "The heart muscle diseases hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies are leading causes of sudden death and heart failure in young, otherwise healthy, individuals. We conducted genome-wide association studies and multi-trait analyses in HCM (1,733 cases), DCM (5,521 cases) and nine left ventricular (LV) traits (19,260 UK Biobank participants with structurally normal hearts). We identified 16 loci associated with HCM, 13 with DCM and 23 with LV traits. We show strong genetic correlations between LV traits and cardiomyopathies, with opposing effects in HCM and DCM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization supports a causal association linking increased LV contractility with HCM risk. A polygenic risk score explains a significant portion of phenotypic variability in carriers of HCM-causing rare variants. Our findings thus provide evidence that polygenic risk score may account for variability in Mendelian diseases. More broadly, we provide insights into how genetic pathways may lead to distinct disorders through opposing genetic effects.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy and is classically caused by pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (P/LP) in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Not all subclinical variant carriers will manifest clinically overt disease because penetrance (proportion of sarcomere or sarcomere-related P/LP variant carriers who develop disease) is variable, age dependent, and not reliably predicted. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed. We used random-effects generalized linear mixed model meta-analyses to contrast the cross-sectional prevalence and penetrance of sarcomere or sarcomere-related genes in 2 different contexts: clinically-based studies on patients and families with HCM versus population or community-based studies. Longitudinal family/clinical studies were additionally analyzed to investigate the rate of phenotypic conversion from subclinical to overt HCM during follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 455 full-text manuscripts and articles were assessed. In family/clinical studies, the prevalence of sarcomere variants in patients diagnosed with HCM was 34%. The penetrance across all genes in nonproband relatives carrying P/LP variants identified during cascade screening was 57% (95% CI, 52%-63%), and the mean age at HCM diagnosis was 38 years (95% CI, 36%-40%). Penetrance varied from ≈32% for MYL3 (myosin light chain 3) to ≈55% for MYBPC3 (myosin-binding protein C3), ≈60% for TNNT2 (troponin T2) and TNNI3 (troponin I3), and ≈65% for MYH7 (myosin heavy chain 7). Population-based genetic studies demonstrate that P/LP sarcomere variants are present in the background population but at a low prevalence of <1%. The penetrance of HCM in incidentally identified P/LP variant carriers was also substantially lower at ≈11%, ranging from 0% in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities to 18% in UK Biobank. In longitudinal family studies, the pooled phenotypic conversion across all genes was 15% over an average of ≈8 years of follow-up, starting from a mean of ≈16 years of age. However, short-term gene-specific phenotypic conversion varied between ≈12% for MYBPC3 and ≈23% for MYH7. CONCLUSIONS: The penetrance of P/LP variants is highly variable and influenced by currently undefined and context-dependent genetic and environmental factors. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to improve our understanding of true lifetime penetrance in families and in the community and to identify drivers of the transition from subclinical to overt HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often caused by pathogenic variants in sarcomeric genes and characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. There are no existing therapies to modify disease progression. In this study, we conducted a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan in attenuating disease evolution in early HCM. In total, 178 participants with early-stage sarcomeric HCM were randomized (1:1) to receive valsartan (320 mg daily in adults; 80-160 mg daily in children) or placebo for 2 years ( NCT01912534 ). Standardized changes from baseline to year 2 in LV wall thickness, mass and volumes; left atrial volume; tissue Doppler diastolic and systolic velocities; and serum levels of high-sensitivity troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic protein were integrated into a single composite z-score as the primary outcome. Valsartan (n = 88) improved cardiac structure and function compared to placebo (n = 90), as reflected by an increase in the composite z-score (between-group difference +0.231, 95% confidence interval (+0.098, +0.364); P = 0.001), which met the primary endpoint of the study. Treatment was well-tolerated. These results indicate a key opportunity to attenuate disease progression in early-stage sarcomeric HCM with an accessible and safe medication.",

        "Abstract Note": "RATIONALE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic paradigm of cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis are important risk factors for sudden death and morbidity in HCM. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Treatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reverses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in animal models of HCM. OBJECTIVE: To determine effect sizes of NAC on indices of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in patients with established HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: HALT-HCM (Hypertrophy Regression With N-Acetylcysteine in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) is a double-blind, randomized, sex-matched, placebo-controlled single-center pilot study in patients with HCM. Patients with HCM, who had a left ventricular wall thickness of ≥15 mm, were randomized either to a placebo or to NAC (1:2 ratio, respectively). NAC was titrated ≤2.4 g per day. Clinical evaluation, blood chemistry, and 6-minute walk test were performed every 3 months, and electrocardiography, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the latter whenever not contraindicated, before and after 12 months of treatment. Eighty-five of 232 screened patients met the eligibility criteria, 42 agreed to participate; 29 were randomized to NAC and 13 to placebo groups. Demographic, echocardiographic, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes at the baseline between the 2 groups were similar. WSE in 38 patients identified a spectrum of 42 pathogenic variants in genes implicated in HCM in 26 participants. Twenty-four patients in the NAC group and 11 in the placebo group completed the study. Six severe adverse events occurred in the NAC group but were considered unrelated to NAC. The effect sizes of NAC on the clinical phenotype, echocardiographic, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indices of cardiac hypertrophy, function, and extent of late gadolinium enhancement-a surrogate for fibrosis-were small. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NAC for 12 months had small effect sizes on indices of cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. The small sample size of the HALT-HCM study hinders from making firm conclusions about efficacy of NAC in HCM. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Abstract Note": "Agammaglobulinemia is the most profound primary antibody deficiency that can occur due to an early termination of B-cell development. We here investigated 3 novel patients, including the first known adult, from unrelated families with agammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Two of them also presented with intermittent or severe chronic neutropenia. We identified homozygous or compound-heterozygous variants in the gene for folliculin interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), leading to loss of the FNIP1 protein. B-cell metabolism, including mitochondrial numbers and activity and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, was impaired. These defects recapitulated the Fnip1-/- animal model. Moreover, we identified either uniparental disomy or copy-number variants (CNVs) in 2 patients, expanding the variant spectrum of this novel inborn error of immunity. The results indicate that FNIP1 deficiency can be caused by complex genetic mechanisms and support the clinical utility of exome sequencing and CNV analysis in patients with broad phenotypes, including agammaglobulinemia and HCM. FNIP1 deficiency is a novel inborn error of immunity characterized by early and severe B-cell development defect, agammaglobulinemia, variable neutropenia, and HCM. Our findings elucidate a functional and relevant role of FNIP1 in B-cell development and metabolism and potentially neutrophil activity.",

In this study we investigated the frequency of LAMP2 mutations in an unselected pediatric HCM population. METHODS AND RESULTS: LAMP2 was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from peripheral lymphocytes of 50 patients diagnosed with HCM and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. In 2 of the 50 probands (4%), nonsense mutations were identified. In 1 family the proband initially presented with HCM as a teenager, which progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure. Skeletal myopathy and WPW were also noted. The teenage sister of the proband is a carrier of the same LAMP2 mutation and has HCM without skeletal myopathy or WPW. The other proband presented with HCM, WPW, and skeletal myopathy as a teenager, whereas his carrier mother developed DCM during her 40s. Skeletal and cardiac muscle sections revealed the absence of LAMP-2 on immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP2 mutations may account for a significant proportion of cases of HCM in children, especially when skeletal myopathy and/or WPW is present, suggesting that Danon disease is an underrecognized entity in the pediatric cardiology community.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphisms have recently been shown to be associated with risk of developing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, the results were controversial. We aimed to conduct this meta-analysis to further confirm the association between ACE rs4646994 polymorphism and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, the Chinese National Knowledge Information, and Wanfang databases were searched for eligible studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Then we evaluated the association between ACE gene mutation and HCM/DCM by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Subgroup analysis was further performed to explore situations in specialized subjects. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias was assessed to confirm the study reliability. RESULTS: There were 13 studies on DCM (2004 cases and 1376 controls) and 16 studies on HCM (2161 controls and 1192 patients). ACE rs4646994 polymorphism was significantly associated with DCM in all genetic models. However, in HCM, four genetic models (allele model, homozygous model, heterozygous model, and dominant model) showed significant association between ACE rs4646994 polymorphism and DCM. In subgroup analysis, we found that ACE rs4646994 polymorphism was significantly associated with DCM/HCM in Asian population. Finally, we also conducted a cumulative meta-analysis, which indicates that the results of our meta-analysis are highly reliable. CONCLUSION: ACE rs4646994 polymorphism increases the risk of DCM/HCM in Asians, but not in Caucasians. More case-control studies are needed to strengthen our conclusions and to assess the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions between ACE rs4646994 polymorphism and DCM/HCM.",

Impact of genetic testing for the prognosis and treatment of patients with HCM needs to be improved. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the characteristics and outcomes associated with sarcomere genotypes in index patients with HCM. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to Dec 31, 2023. Data on clinical characteristics, morphological and imaging features, outcomes and interventions were collected from published studies and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies with 10,825 HCM index patients were included in the pooled analyses. The frequency of sarcomere genes in HCM patients was 41%. Sarcomere mutations were more frequent in women (p < 0.00001), and were associated with lower body mass index (26.1 ± 4.7 versus 27.5 ± 4.3; p = 0.003) and left ventricular ejection fraction (65.7% ± 10.1% vs. 67.1% ± 8.6%; p = 0.03), less apical hypertrophy (6.5% vs. 20.1%; p < 0.0001) and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (29.1% vs. 33.2%; p = 0.03), greater left atrial volume index (43.6 ± 21.1 ml/m2 vs. 37.3 ± 13.0 ml/m2; p = 0.02). Higher risks of ventricular tachycardia (23.4% vs. 14.1%; p < 0.0001), syncope (18.3% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.01) and heart failure (17.3% vs. 14.6%; p = 0.002) were also associated with sarcomere mutations.

        "Abstract Note": "The Sry-related high-mobility-group box (SOX) gene family, with 20 known transcription factors in humans, plays an essential role during development and disease processes. Several SOX proteins (SOX4, 11, and 9) are required for normal heart morphogenesis. SOX9 was shown to contribute to cardiac fibrosis. However, differential expression of other SOXs and their roles in the failing human myocardium have not been explored. Here, we used the whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), gene co-expression, and meta-analysis to examine whether any SOX factors might play a role in the failing human myocardium. RNA-seq analysis was performed for cardiac tissue samples from heart failure (HF) patients due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and healthy donors (NF). The RNA levels of 20 SOX genes from RNA-seq data were extracted and compared to the 3 groups. Four SOX genes whose RNA levels were significantly upregulated in DCM or HCM compared to NF. However, only SOX4 and SOX8 proteins were markedly increased in the HF groups. A moderate to strong correlation was observed between the RNA level of SOX4/8 and fibrotic genes among each individual. Gene co-expression network analysis identified genes associated and respond similarly to perturbations with SOX4 in cardiac tissues. Using a meta-analysis combining epigenetics and genome-wide association data, we reported several genomic variants associated with HF phenotype linked to SOX4 or SOX8. In summary, our results implicate that SOX4 and SOX8 have a role in cardiomyopathy, leading to HF in humans. The molecular mechanism associated with them in HF warrants further investigation.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Genetic investigations have established that mutations in proteins of the contractile unit of the myocardium, known as the sarcomere, may be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). It has become clinical practice to offer genetic testing in affected individuals to identify causative mutations, which provides the basis for presymptomatic testing of relatives who are at risk of disease development. This ensures adequate clinical follow-up of mutation carriers, whereas noncarriers can be discharged. However, before genetic testing can be used for individual risk assessment and prediction of prognosis, it is important to investigate if there is a relation between the clinical disease expression (phenotype) of the condition and mutations in specific disease genes (genotype). METHODS: We reviewed the literature in relation to phenotypic features reported to be associated with mutations in cardiac troponin I (cTnI; TNNI3), which is a recognized sarcomeric disease gene in all 3 cardiomyopathies. RESULTS: The results of this review did not identify specific genotype-phenotype relations in HCM or DCM, and cTnI appeared to be the most frequent disease gene in RCM. CONCLUSIONS: To further explore if there is a genotype-phenotype relation, long-term follow-up studies are needed. It is essential to investigate the natural history of the condition among affected individuals and to provide clinical follow-up on disease development among healthy mutation carriers. Such information is required to provide evidence-based counselling for affected families and to elucidate if knowledge about specific genotypes can be used in future risk prediction models.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of a positive genetic test for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) on clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 203 unrelated patients with HCM (mean +/- SD age, 50+/-18 years) was enrolled from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. They were followed up for a mean +/- SD time of 4.0+/-1.7 years after genetic testing of the 8 HCM-susceptibility genes that encode key sarcomeric/myofilament proteins. The clinical phenotype of those with a positive genetic test (myofilament-positive HCM) was compared with those with a negative genetic test (myofilament-negative HCM). RESULTS: In this cohort of 203 patients, 87 mutations were identified in 126 patients (myofilament-positive HCM, 62%); the remaining 77 patients (38%) were myofilament-negative. Despite similar baseline features, patients with myofilament-positive HCM showed increased risk of the combined end points of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, or progression to New York Heart Association class III or IV compared with the patients with myofilament-negative HCM (25% vs 7%, respectively; independent hazard ratio, 4.27; P=.008). These end points occurred at any age among patients with myofilament-positive HCM (range, 14-86 years), but only in those aged 65 years and older among patients with myofilament-negative HCM. Moreover, patients with myofilament-positive HCM showed greater probability of severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, defined as an ejection fraction of less than 50% and a restrictive filling pattern (P=.02 and P<.02, respectively, vs myofilament-negative HCM). CONCLUSION: Screening for sarcomere protein gene mutations in HCM identifies a broad subgroup of patients with increased propensity toward long-term impairment of left ventricular function and adverse outcome, irrespective of the myofilament (thick, intermediate, or thin) involved.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The presence of variants in OBSCN was identified to be linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but whether OBSCN truncating variants were associated with HCM remained unknown. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 986 patients with HCM and 761 non-HCM controls to search for OBSCN truncating variants, and the result was tested in a replication cohort consisting of 529 patients with HCM and 307 controls. The association of the OBSCN truncating variants with baseline characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCM were ascertained. RESULTS: There were 28 qualifying truncating variants in the OBSCN gene detected in 26 (2.6%) patients with HCM and 6 (0.8%) controls. The OBSCN truncating variants were more prevalent in patients with HCM than controls (odds ratio, 3.4, P=0.004). This association was confirmed in the replication cohort (odds ratio, 3.8, P=0.024). The combined effects of the two cohorts estimated the odds ratio to be 3.58 (P<0.001). Patients with or without OBSCN truncating variants shared similar demographic and echocardiographic variables at baseline. During 3.3±2.4 years (4795 patient-years) follow-up, the patients with OBSCN truncating variants were more likely to experience cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.40-6.70], P=0.005) and all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.21-5.71], P=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that OBSCN truncating variants contributed to the disease-onset of HCM, and increased the risk of malignant events in patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are common heart muscle disorders that are caused by pathogenic variants in sarcomere protein genes. In this study, we describe a variant in the MHY7 gene, segregating in a family having three different phenotypes of cardiomyopathies. MYH7 encodes for the myosin heavy-chain β (MHC-β) isoform involved in cardiac muscle contractility. METHOD AND RESULTS: We present the case of a family with four members diagnosed with HCM and four members with DCM. The proband is a 42-year-old man diagnosed with HCM. He has an extended family of eight siblings; two of them are diagnosed with HCM and are implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) carriers. One of the siblings died at the age of 23 after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest and DCM of unknown etiology which was diagnosed at autopsy. Another brother was diagnosed with DCM during a routine echocardiographic exam. Genetic testing was performed for the proband and two of his siblings and a niece of the proband, who suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of nine, all being MYH7 mutation positive. For all four of them, cardiac imaging was performed with different findings. They are ICD carriers as well. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal three variants in phenotypes of cardiomyopathies in a family with MYH7 mutation associated with high SCD risk and ICD needed for primary and secondary prevention.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: To assess patients with different types of mutations of the beta myosin heavy chain (beta MHC) gene causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and to determine the prognosis of patients according to the affected functional domain of beta MHC. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study of subjects referred to an HCM clinic at an academic hospital. PATIENTS: 70 probands from the HCM clinic were screened for mutations of the beta MHC gene and 148 family members of the genotype positive probands were further assessed. The control group for the genetic studies consisted of 106 healthy subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct DNA sequencing was used to screen 70 probands for mutations of the beta MHC gene. Family members underwent genotypic and detailed clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic assessments. The survival of genotype positive subjects was evaluated according to the type of functional domain affected by the missense mutation and according to phenotypic characteristics. RESULTS: A mutation of the beta MHC gene was detected in 15 of 70 probands (21%). Of 148 family members studied in these 15 families, 74 were identified with a beta MHC defect. Eleven mutations were detected, including four novel mutations: Ala196Thr, Pro211Leu, Val404Leu, and Arg870Cys. Median survival was 66 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 64 to 77 years) in all affected subjects. There was a significant difference in survival between subjects according to the affected functional domain (p = 0.02). Significant independent predictors of decreased survival were the non-conservative (that is, associated with a change in the amino acid charge) missense mutations that affected the actin binding site (hazard ratio 4.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.8; p = 0.003) and those that affected the rod portion of beta MHC (hazard ratio 4.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.4; p = 0.03). No phenotypic characteristics were associated with decreased survival or cardiovascular morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The type of beta MHC functional domain affected by the missense mutation is predictive of overall prognosis in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant disease, but the genetic defects are still unclear in many cases. Reduced myocardial long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake has been demonstrated in patients with some types of HCM. In addition, a possible relationship between a shift ofmyocardial substrate utilization and cardiac hypertrophy has been suggested by experimental studies. Myocardial uptake of LCFAs occurs via a specific transporter, which is homologous with human CD36. CD36 deficiency has also been reported in some individuals, and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait like HCM. In this study, we analyzed CD36 in 47 patients with HCM [29 with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) and 18 without ASH], 11 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and 26 patients with pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy. Eleven patients (37.9%) who had HCM with ASH, one (9.1%) with DCM, and two (7.7%) with pressure-overload hypertrophy showed CD36 deficiency, while none of the HCM patients without ASH had CD36 deficiency. One patient who had HCM with ASH and CD36 deficiency showed no myocardial LCFA uptake, although myocardial perfusion was normal. Reduced myocardial LCFA uptake despite normal myocardial perfusion was demonstrated in the other HCM patients with ASH and CD36 deficiency. Based on the high prevalence of CD36 deficiency in HCM patients with ASH, we hypothesize that this deficiency might be one etiology of hereditary HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance mainly caused by single heterozygous mutations in sarcomere genes. Although multiple gene mutations have recently been reported in Western countries, clinical implications of multiple mutations in Japanese subjects are not clear. METHODS AND RESULTS: A comprehensive genetic analysis of 5 sarcomere genes (cardiac β-myosin heavy chain gene [MYH7], cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene [MYBPC3], cardiac troponin T gene [TNNT2], α-tropomyosin gene [TPM1] and cardiac troponin I gene [TNNI3]) was performed in 93 unrelated patients and 14 mutations were identified in 28 patients. Twenty-six patients had single heterozygosity (20 in MYBPC3, 4 in MYH7, 1 in TNNT2, 1 in TNNI3), whereas 2 proband patients with familial HCM had double heterozygosity: 1 with P106fs in MYBPC3 and R869C in MYH7 and 1 with R945fs in MYBPC3 and E1049D in MYH7. From the results of the family survey and the previous literature on HCM mutations, P106fs, R945fs and R869C seemed to be pathological mutations and E1049D might be a rare polymorphism. The proband patient with P106fs and R869C double mutation was diagnosed as having HCM at an earlier age (28 years of age) than her relatives with single mutation, and had greater wall thickness with left ventricular outflow obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: One double mutation was identified in a Japanese cohort of HCM patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of multiple mutations including phenotypic severity.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically heterogeneous genetic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another disease that could explain the wall thickening. Elucidation of the genetic basis of HCM lead to the identification of several genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, such as MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3. Sarcomeric genes are mutated in approximately 40% of HCM patients and a possible explanation for the incomplete yield of mutation-positive HCM may be somatic mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 104 unrelated patients with non-familial HCM. Patients underwent clinical evaluation and mutation screening of 5 genes implicated in HCM (MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3) in genomic DNA isolated from resected cardiac tissue; 41 of 104 were found to carry a mutation, but as several patients carried the same mutations, the total amount of different mutations was 37; 20 of these mutations have been previously described, and pathogenicity has been assessed. To determine the effect of the 17 new mutations an in silico assay was performed and it predicted that 4 variants were damaging mutations. All identified variants were also seen in the DNA isolated from the corresponding blood, which demonstrated the absence of somatic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic mutations in MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3 do not represent an important etiologic pathway in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "The development of left ventricular hypertrophy in subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is variable, suggesting a role for modifying factors such as angiotensin II. Angiotensin II mediates both trophic and antitrophic effects, via angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)-R) and angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)-R) receptors, respectively. Here we investigated the effect of the AT(2)-R gene A/C(3123) polymorphism, located in the 3' untranslated region of exon 3, on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in 103 genetically independent subjects with HCM (age, 12 to 81 years). LVMI and interventricular septum thickness were determined by 2D echocardiography. Extent of hypertrophy was quantified by a point score (Wigle score). Plasma prorenin, renin, and ACE were determined by immunoradiometric or fluorometric assays, and genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction. In men, no associations between AT(2)-R genotype and any of the measured parameters were observed, whereas in women, LVMI decreased with the number of C alleles (211+/-19, 201+/-18, and 152+/-10 g/m(2) in women with the AA, AC, and CC genotype, respectively; P=0.015). Similar C allele-related decreases in women were observed for interventricular septum thickness (P=0.13), Wigle score (P=0.05), plasma renin (P=0.03), and plasma prorenin (P=0.26). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the AT(2)-R C allele-related effect on LVMI (beta=-30.7+/-11.1, P=0.010) occurred independently of plasma renin, the AT(1)-R gene A/C(1166) polymorphism, or the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. In conclusion, AT(2)-Rs modulate cardiac hypertrophy in women with HCM, independently of the circulating renin-angiotensin system. These data support the contention that AT(2)-Rs mediate antitrophic effects in humans.",

PURPOSE: To determine the range of native myocardial T1 value ranges in patients with NICM and populations with increased cardiovascular risk. STUDY TYPE: Systemic review and meta-analysis. POPULATION: Patients with NICM, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and patients with myocarditis (MC), iron overload, amyloidosis, Fabry disease, and populations with hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), and obesity. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: (Shortened) modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery MR sequence at 1.5 or 3T. ASSESSMENT: PubMed and Embase were searched following the PRISMA guidelines. STATISTICAL TESTS: The summary of standard mean difference (SMD) between the diseased and a healthy control populations was generated using a random-effects model in combination with meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: The SMD for HCM, DCM, and MC patients were significantly increased (1.41, 1.48, and 1.96, respectively, P < 0.01) compared with healthy controls. The SMD for HT patients with and without left-ventricle hypertrophy (LVH) together was significantly increased (0.19, P = 0.04), while for HT patients without LVH the SMD was zero (0.03, P = 0.52). The number of studies on amyloidosis, iron overload, Fabry disease, and HT patients with LVH did not meet the requirement to perform a meta-analysis. However, most studies reported a significantly increased T1 for amyloidosis and HT patients with LVH and a significant decreased T1 for iron overload and Fabry disease patients. DATA CONCLUSIONS: Native T1 mapping by using an (Sh)MOLLI sequence can potentially assess myocardial changes in HCM, DCM, MC, iron overload, amyloidosis, and Fabry disease compared to controls. In addition, it can help to diagnose left-ventricular remodeling in HT patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2018;47:891-912.",

However, there have been inconsonant results among different studies. To clarify the influence of ACE and AGT on HCM, a systemic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies were performed. The following databases were searched to indentify related studies: PubMed database, the Embase database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, China National Knowledge Information database, and Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal database. Search terms included \"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\", \"angiotensin converting enzyme\" (ACE) or \"ACE\" and \"polymorphism or mutation\". For the association of AGT M235T polymorphism and HCM, \"angiotensin converting enzyme\" or \"ACE\" was replaced with \"angiotensinogen\". A total of seventeen studies were included in our review. For the association of ACE I/D polymorphism and HCM, eleven literatures were included in the meta-analysis on association of penetrance and genotype. Similarly, six case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis for AGT M235T. For ACE I/D polymorphism, the comparison of DI/II genotype vs DD genotype was performed in the present meta-analysis. The OR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.527, 0.998, P = 0.049, power = 94%, alpha = 0.05) after the study which deviated from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was excluded, indicating that the ACE I/D gene polymorphism might be associated with HCM. The AGT M235T polymorphism did not significantly affect the risk of HCM. In addition, ACE I/D gene polymorphism did not significantly influence the interventricular septal thickness in HCM patients. In conclusion, the ACE I/D polymorphism might be associated with the risk of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Genetic factors in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies have received a lot of attention during the past 2 decades. Some studies have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there have been inconsonant results among different studies. To clarify the influence of ACE on HCM, a systemic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies were performed. METHODS: The following databases were searched to indentify related studies: PubMed database, the Embase database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, China National Knowledge Information database, and Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal database. Search terms included \"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,\" \"angiotensin converting enzyme\" or \"ACE,\" and \"polymorphism or mutation.\" RESULTS: Fifteen separate studies were suitable for the inclusion criterion. The selected studies contained 2972 participants, including 1047 in HCM group and 1925 controls. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to assess the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and HCM. Our case-control data indicated that D allele carrier is a risk allele in all genetic models: allele contrast (D vs I: OR = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.65, P = .004), homozygous comparison (DD vs II: OR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.12-2.54; P = .01), dominant model (DD + ID vs II: OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.15-2.02, P = .003), and recessive model (DD vs ID + II: OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.99-1.81, P = .03). CONCLUSION: In summary, the current meta-analysis provided solid evidence suggesting that ACE gene I/D polymorphism was probably a genetic risk factor for HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease with an estimated prevalence of 1/500. More than 40 genes have been reported to cause HCM. Among them, CSRP3 is usually included on HCM gene panels used for molecular diagnosis by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a NGS workflow based on a panel of 48 cardiomyopathies-causing genes was analyzed on a cohort of 542 HCM patients. As expected, this molecular approach led to identify most pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants into prevalent HCM-causing genes: MYBPC3 (123/542; 22.7%), MYH7 (48/542; 8.9%), TNNT2 (12/542; 2.2%), and TNNI3 (10/542; 1.8%). Among MYBPC3 variants, 96 led to a premature stop codon (78%). More surprisingly, our molecular study led also to detect, for the first time, homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants in two unrelated HCM probands. Meta-analysis of rare previously reported CSRP3 variants on HCM probands using ACMG guidelines indicate that only one variation (p.Cys58Gly) could be considered as likely pathogen. By combining meta-analysis results and identification of two unrelated HCM patients with homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants, we suggest that the association of CSRP3 as a validated HCM-causing gene require additional studies and those CSRP3 variants could result in HCM with an autosomal recessive inheritance rather than with an autosomal dominant transmission as usually reported on HCM (OMIM 612124).",

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, CNKI, Wan Fang, and other databases were searched to collect the literature about AGT M235T polymorphism and HCM from the inception to March 1, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) checklist was uesd to perform independent literature review and study quality assessment. Data was analyzed by Stata 15.0 software. RESULTS: The results showed that, except for the recessive genetic model (TT vs MT+MM: OR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.05-1.53), in the other four genetic models, the M235T polymorphism had no significant correlation with the risk of HCM (T vs M: OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 0.88-1.57; TT+MT vs MM: OR = 1.13, 95%CI: 0.55-2.33; TT vs MM: OR = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.60-2.59; TM vs MM: OR = 0.95, 95%CI0.5-1.82). The results of subgroup analysis showed that, except for the heterozygous genetic model, in the other four genetic models, M235T polymorphism was significantly associated with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SHCM), but not with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: M235T polymorphism in Asians is associated with HCM, especially SHCM. Heterozygotes increase the risk of patients with SHCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically heterogeneous autosomal dominant heart disease characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease that is capable of producing significant wall thickening. Microscopically it is characterised by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray and fibrosis. The phenotypic expression of HCM is multifactorial, with the majority of cases occurring secondary to mutations in genes encoding the sarcomere proteins. In conjunction with the genetic heterogeneity of HCM, phenotypic expression also exhibits a high level of variability even within families with the same aetiological mutation, and may be influenced by additional genetic factors. Polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) represent an attractive hypothesis as potential disease modifiers, as these genetic variants alter the 'activation status' of the RAAS, which leads to more left ventricular hypertrophy through different pathways. The main objective of this review is to provide an overview of the role of different polymorphisms identified in the RAAS, in patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "During the last two decades, mutations in sarcomere genes have found to comprise the most common cause for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but still significant number of patients with dominant HCM in the family are left without molecular genetic diagnosis. Next generation sequencing (NGS) does not only enable evaluation of established HCM genes but also candidate genes for cardiomyopathy are frequently tested which may lead to a situation where conclusive interpretation of the variant requires extensive family studies. We aimed to characterize the phenotype related to a variant in the junctophilin-2 (JPH2) gene, which is less known non-sarcomeric candidate gene. In addition, we did extensive review of the literature and databases about JPH2 variation in association with cardiac disease. We characterize nine Finnish index patients with HCM and heterozygous for JPH2 c.482C>A, p.(Thr161Lys) variant were included and segregation studies were performed. We identified 20 individuals affected with HCM with or without systolic heart failure and conduction abnormalities in the nine Finnish families with JPH2 p.(Thr161Lys) variant. We found 26 heterozygotes with the variant and penetrance was 71% by age 60 and 100% by age 80. Co-segregation of the variant with HCM phenotype was observed in six families. Main clinical features were left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia vulnerability and conduction abnormalities including third degree AV-block. In some patients end-stage severe left ventricular heart failure with normal or mildly enlarged diastolic dimensions was detected. In conclusion, we propose that the heterozygous JPH2 p.(Thr161Lys) variant is a new Finnish mutation causing atypical HCM.",

In total, 44% of patients with HCM-MVO carried the cardiomyopathy-associated genetic variant (CAGV) in 14 genes. Only 21% of patients carried HCM-associated CAGVs in major sarcomere-encoding genes, while 18% of patients carried CAGVs in dilated cardiomyopathy/arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy-associated genes. CAGVs were more frequent in patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) than in those without ASH.

        "Abstract Note": "'Genome-first' approaches to analyzing rare variants can reveal new insights into human biology and disease. Because pathogenic variants are often rare, new discovery requires aggregating rare coding variants into 'gene burdens' for sufficient power. However, a major challenge is deciding which variants to include in gene burden tests. Pathogenic variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 are well-known causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and focusing on these 'positive control' genes in a genome-first approach could help inform variant selection methods and gene burdening strategies for other genes and diseases. Integrating exome sequences with electronic health records among 41 759 participants in the Penn Medicine BioBank, we evaluated the performance of aggregating predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) and/or predicted deleterious missense (pDM) variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 for gene burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The approach to grouping rare variants for these two genes produced very different results: pLOFs but not pDM variants in MYBPC3 were strongly associated with HCM, whereas the opposite was true for MYH7. Detailed review of clinical charts revealed that only 38.5% of patients with HCM diagnoses carrying an HCM-associated variant in MYBPC3 or MYH7 had a clinical genetic test result. Additionally, 26.7% of MYBPC3 pLOF carriers without HCM diagnoses had clear evidence of left atrial enlargement and/or septal/LV hypertrophy on echocardiography. Our study shows the importance of evaluating both pLOF and pDM variants for gene burden testing in future studies to uncover novel gene-disease relationships and identify new pathogenic loss-of-function variants across the human genome through genome-first analyses of healthcare-based populations.",

        "Abstract Note": "Over 1,500 gene mutations are known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Previous studies suggest that cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) gene mutations are commonly associated with a more severe phenotype, compared to cardiac myosin binding protein-C (MYBPC3) gene mutations with milder phenotype, incomplete penetrance and later age of onset. Compound mutations can worsen the phenotype. This study aimed to validate these comparative differences in a large cohort of individuals and families with HCM. We performed genome-phenome correlation among 80 symptomatic HCM patients, 35 asymptomatic carriers and 35 non-carriers, using an 18-gene clinical diagnostic HCM panel. A total of 125 mutations were identified in 14 genes. MYBPC3 and MYH7 mutations contributed to 50.0% and 24.4% of the HCM patients, respectively, suggesting that MYBPC3 mutations were the most frequent cause of HCM in our cohort. Double mutations were found in only nine HCM patients (7.8%) who were phenotypically indistinguishable from single-mutation carriers. Comparisons of clinical parameters of MYBPC3 and MYH7 mutants were not statistically significant, but asymptomatic carriers had high left ventricular ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction when compared to non-carriers. The presence of double mutations increases the risk for symptomatic HCM with no change in severity, as determined in this study subset. The pathologic effects of MYBPC3 and MYH7 were found to be independent of gene mutation location. Furthermore, HCM pathology is independent of protein domain disruption in both MYBPC3 and MYH7. These data provide evidence that MYBPC3 mutations constitute the preeminent cause of HCM and that they are phenotypically indistinguishable from HCM caused by MYH7 mutations.",

We aimed to perform a nationwide large-scale genetic analysis of a previously unreported, representative HCM cohort in Hungary. A total of 242 consecutive HCM index patients (127 men, 44 ± 11 years) were studied with next generation sequencing using a custom-designed gene-panel comprising 98 cardiomyopathy-related genes. A total of 90 patients (37%) carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants. The percentage of patients with P/LP variants in genes with definitive evidence for HCM association was 93%. Most of the patients with P/LP variants had mutations in MYBPC3 (55 pts, 61%) and in MYH7 (21 pts, 23%). Double P/LP variants were present in four patients (1.7%). P/LP variants in other genes could be detected in ≤3% of patients. Of the patients without P/LP variants, 46 patients (19%) carried a variant of unknown significance. Non-HCM P/LP variants were identified in six patients (2.5%), with two in RAF1 (p.Leu633Val, p.Ser257Leu) and one in DES (p.Arg406Trp), FHL1 (p.Glu96Ter), TTN (p.Lys23480fs), and in the mitochondrial genome (m.3243A>G). Frameshift, nonsense, and splice-variants made up 82% of all P/LP MYBPC3 variants. In all the other genes, missense mutations were the dominant form of variants. The MYBPC3 p.Gln1233Ter, the MYBPC3 p.Pro955ArgfsTer95, and the MYBPC3 p.Ser593ProfsTer11 variants were identified in 12, 7, and 13 patients, respectively. These three variants made up 36% of all patients with identified P/LP variants, raising the possibility of a possible founder effect for these mutations. Similar to other HCM populations, the MYBPC3 and the MYH7 genes seemed to be the most frequently affected genes in Hungarian HCM patients. The high prevalence of three MYBPC3 mutations raises the possibility of a founder effect in our HCM cohort.",

Previous genetic reports have shown that pathogenic variants of genes encoding Z-disc components such as telethonin protein (TCAP) are the primary cause of DCM and HCM. METHODS: This study was the first investigation on the TCAP gene among the Iranian cardiomyopathies population wherein the TCAP gene was analyzed in 40 unrelated patients (17 females and 23 males) who were clinically diagnosed with HCM and DCM. In addition, we conducted a thorough review of all published articles and the databases that were the first to report novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants the in TCAP gene. RESULTS: In the cohort of this study, we identified only one intronic variant c.111-42G > A in one of the HCM patients that were predicted as polymorphism by in-silico analysis. Moreover, a total of 44 variants were reported for the TCAP gene in the literature where a majority of mutations were found to be missense. Pathogenic mutations in TCAP may cause diseases including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2G (LGMD-2G), DCM, HCM, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and telethonin deficiency. However, a large number of affected patients were clinically diagnosed with limb-girdle 2G compared to other presenting phenotypes. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that the TCAP gene pathogenic mutations might not be a common cause of cardiomyopathies among Iranian patients. These gene disease-causing mutations may cause various manifestations, but it has a high prevalence among LGMD-2G, HCM, and DCM patients.",

No mutation is identified in up to 50% of cases of HCM following comprehensive analysis of known causal genes, however standard methods overlook large deletions and duplications. The multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification method was used to screen for large deletions and duplications in the myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3) and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) genes in patients with HCM. One novel 3 base pair deletion was identified in MYBPC3 in a severely affected patient; however this change was also found in an unaffected relative. No alterations in the TNNT2 gene were identified. In conclusion, large deletions and duplications do not appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Approximately half of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients lack a precise genetic diagnosis. The likelihood of identifying clinically relevant variants increased over time. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a gene-centric reanalysis of exome data of 200 HCM cases 5 years after the initial analysis. This reanalysis prioritized genes with a matched HCM entry in the OMIM database and recently emerging HCM-associated genes gathered using a text mining-based literature review. Further classification of the identified genes and variants was performed using the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) resource and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to assess the robustness of gene-disease association and the clinical actionability of the prioritized variants. RESULTS: As expected, the majority of patients carried variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 genes, 26% (n = 51) and 8% (n = 16), respectively, in accordance with the initial analysis. The vast majority of pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic (LP) variants were found in MYBPC3 (22 out of 40 variants) and MYH7 (8 out of 16 variants) genes. Three genes-not included in the initial analysis-were identified: SVIL, FHOD3, and TRIM63. Considering only patients with unique variants in the last three genes, there was a 9% enhancement in variant identification. Importantly, SVIL variant carriers presented apical and septal HCM, aortopathies, and severe scoliosis for one patient. Ten patients (5%) carried variants in the FHOD3 gene, six in hotspot regions (exons 12 and 15). We identified seven variants within the TRIM63 gene in 12 patients (6%). Homozygous variants were detected in 2.5% of the cohort in MYBPC3 (n = 1), MYL3 (n = 1), and TRIM63 (n = 3) genes. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that no variants were found in the ACTC1, TPM1, and TNNI3 genes in the HYPERGEN cohort. However, we identified variants in five out of the eight HCM core genes, with a high prevalence in young patients. We identified variants in three recent HCM-associated genes (SVIL, FHOD3, and TRIM63) in 35 patients, with 18 patients carrying unique variants (9%). Our results further emphasize the usefulness of exome data reanalysis, particularly in genotype-negative patients.",

Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy is a recessive genetic trait. FKTN mutations in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have been investigated by our research group. The patients showed hyper-CKemia with mild or no muscle weakness and without mental retardation, suggesting that the clinical spectrum of FKTN mutations are wider than previously thought. The current study was designed to further explore the association of FKTN mutations with DCM or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 172 patients with DCM, 144 patients with familial HCM and 384 control individuals were analyzed for FKTN mutations. There was a DCM patient who was a compound heterozygote of a 3-kb insertion mutation and a missense mutation Cys101Phe. The patient showed hyper-CKemia with mild muscle involvement and no brain involvement. In contrast, 2 other DCM patients and 3 controls were heterozygous for the insertion mutation and normal allele, showing that the heterozygous insertion mutation itself was not associated with DCM. No mutation was found in the HCM patients. CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicated that the compound heterozygous FKTN mutation was a rare cause of DCM. Hyper-CKemia might be indicative of FKTN mutation in DCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: Mutations in ion channels genes are potential cause of cardiomyopathy. The SCN5A gene (sodium channel, voltage gated, type V alpha subunit gene; 3p21) belongs to the family of cardiac sodium channel genes. Mutations in SCN5A gene lead to decreased Na+ current and ion unbalance. The SCN5A gene mutations are found in approximately 2% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and they may be potential phenotype modifiers in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The role of SCN5A gene mutations in cardiomyopathy is not fully elucidated. METHODS: Three selected exons (12, 20, and 21) of the SCN5A gene in the cohort of 58 East Slovak patients with dilated and HCM were analyzed by the Sanger sequencing method in order to detect etiopathogenic mutations associated with dilated and HCM. RESULTS: The mutation screening of three selected exons of SCN5A gene in the cohort of 27 DCM, 12 HCM patients, and 16 controls identified 10 missense genetic variants. Three of them (T1247I, A1260D, and G1262S), all in exon 21 of the SCN5A gene, were potentially damaging and disease-causing variants. CONCLUSION: Data from this study demonstrate that SCN5A gene variants have important role in the etiopathogenesis of dilated and HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Several mutations of cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) gene were reported in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Involvement of proto-oncogenes has been shown in the mechanism of experimental cardiac hypertrophy. This study sought to examine the effects of c-H-ras and c-myc expression in the steady-state myocardium on hypertrophic changes and to evaluate the possible interaction between beta-MHC mutation and proto-oncogene expression in HCM. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed in 17 HCM patients (5 beta-MHC mutations and 1 troponin T mutation) and 7 control subjects (no mutation). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed c-H-ras expression in all members of both groups. Cardiomyocyte size was correlated with the expression level of c-H-ras (P<0.001), and c-H-ras expression was upregulated in HCM patients (P<0.01). HCM patients with a beta-MHC mutation had the higher c-H-ras expression than did control subjects or patients without a mutation (P<0.01). c-myc mRNA was expressed in 7 of 17 HCM patients but not in control subjects. Myocyte size was greater in c-myc-positive HCM patients than in control subjects and c-myc-negative HCM patients (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). The proto-oncogene expression did not affect clinical findings, myocardial fibrosis, or disarray. In conclusion, c-H-ras and c-myc expression in the steady-state myocardium may play a role in the hypertrophic mechanism in HCM. It is possible that ss-MHC gene mutation has some effect on the regulation of proto-oncogene expression in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The sarcomeric protein actin plays a central, dual role in cardiac myocytes, generating contractile force by interacting with myosin and also transmitting force within and between cells. Two missense mutations in the cardiac actin gene (ACTC), postulated to impair force transmission, have been associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently, a missense mutation in ACTC was found to cosegregate with familial HCM. To further test the hypothesis that mutations within functionally distinct domains of ACTC cause either DCM or HCM, we performed mutational analyses in 368 unrelated patients with familial or sporadic HCM. Single strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses of genomic DNA were performed. De novo mutations in ACTC were identified in two patients with sporadic HCM who presented with syncope in early childhood. Patients were heterozygous for missense mutations resulting in Pro164Ala and Ala331Pro amino acid substitutions, adjacent to regions of actin-actin and actin-myosin interaction, respectively. A mutation that cosegregated with familial HCM was also found, causing a Glu99Lys substitution in a weak actomyosin binding domain. The cardiac phenotype in many affected patients was characterized by an apical form of HCM. These findings support the hypothesis that a single amino acid substitution in actin causes either congestive heart failure or maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, depending on its effect on actin structure and function.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous myocardial disease caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. To assess the genetic background and phenotypic expression of HCM in eastern Finland, we screened 35 unrelated patients with HCM from the Kuopio University Hospital area for variants in 9 genes encoding sarcomeric proteins with the PCR-SSCP method. We herewith describe our previous findings in five sarcomeric genes and also report hitherto unpublished data on four additional sarcomeric genes. Mutations in the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene (MYBPC3) were most frequent, accounting for 26% of cases. A novel mutation (Gln1061X) in this gene was the most common mutation, found in 6 of 35 families and accounting for 17% of all cases. Other novel mutations in MYBPC3 (IVS5-2A --> C, IVS14-13G --> A, and Ex25deltaLys) were found in one family each. A previously described alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1) mutation (Asp175Asn) was found in 11% of cases. Haplotype analysis suggested that the two most common variants (MYBPC3-Gln1061X and TPM1-Asp175Asn) were founder mutations. Only one mutation (Arg719Trp) in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) was found in one family, and no disease-causing mutations were found in the genes encoding alpha-actin, cardiac troponin I, T, C, or myosin essential and regulatory light chains. Altogether, the aforementioned 6 mutations found in MYBPC3, TPM1, and MYH7 accounted for 61% of familial and 40% of all HCM cases. The mutations were associated mostly with benign or intermediary phenotypes with only few HCM-related deaths. We conclude that the genetic profile of HCM in eastern Finland is unique, characterized by few founder mutations with benign or intermediary phenotypes.",

        "Abstract Note": "RATIONALE: Truncation mutations in the MYBPC3 gene, encoding for cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C), are the leading cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Whole heart, fiber and molecular studies demonstrate that MyBP-C is a potent modulator of cardiac contractility, but how these mutations contribute to HCM is unresolved. OBJECTIVES: To readdress whether MYBPC3 truncation mutations result in loss of MyBP-C content and/or the expression of truncated MyBP-C from the mutant allele and determine how these mutations effect myofilament sliding in human myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Septal wall tissue samples were obtained from HCM patients undergoing myectomy (n = 18) and donor controls (n = 8). The HCM samples contained 40% less MyBP-C and reduced levels of MyBP-C phosphorylation, when compared to the donor control samples using quantitative mass spectrometry. These differences occurred in the absence of changes in the stoichiometry of other myofilament proteins or production of truncated MyBP-C from the mutant MYBPC3 allele. The functional impact of MYBPC3 truncation mutations on myofilament sliding was determined using a total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM) single particle assay. Myosin-thick filaments containing their native complement of MyBP-C, and actin-thin filaments decorated with the troponin/tropomyosin calcium regulatory proteins, were isolated from a subgroup of the HCM (n = 4) and donor (n = 5) heart samples. The maximal sliding velocity of native thin filaments was enhanced within the C-zones of the native thick filaments isolated from the HCM samples, when compared to velocity within the C-zones of thick filaments isolated from the donor samples. Analytical modeling demonstrated that the 40% reduction in MyBP-C content was sufficient to enhance the myofilament sliding velocity, as observed in the TIRFM assay. CONCLUSIONS: HCM-causing MYBPC3 truncation mutations result in a loss of MyBP-C content that enhances maximal myofilament sliding velocities, only where MyBP-C is localized within the C-zone. These findings support therapeutic rationale for restoring normal levels of MyBP-C and/or dampening maximal contractile velocities for the treatment of human HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The RASopathies are a class of developmental disorders caused by germline mutations in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been frequently described in children with RASopathy, but only a minority of patients have received formal genotyping. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic basis and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with RASopathy-associated HCM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the mutation spectrum and clinical outcome of all the patients with RASopathy derived from 168 pediatric HCM cases referred to our institution between January 2012 and July 2018. RESULTS: A heterozygous missense mutation in one of known RASopathy genes was identified in 46 unrelated children with HCM. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene were the most prevalent (19/46); this was followed by mutations in RAF1 (11/46), KRAS (5/46), RIT1 (4/46), BRAF (3/46), SOS1 (2/46), HRAS (1/46), and SHOC2 (1/46). Moreover, two compound heterozygous missense mutations in the LZTR1 gene were identified in one patient with the Noonan syndrome phenotype and HCM. The median age at the diagnosis of HCM was 3.0 months (range 0 months to 8.1 years). Twenty-one of the patients had significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and 32 had concomitant congenital heart disease. Three patients with a mutation in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene died of cardiac failure at the ages of 3.0, 3.5, and 6.0 months. The remaining 44 patients were alive after an average follow-up time of 3.9 years (0.5 to 17.1 years, median 2.9 years) from the initial diagnosis of HCM, including 5 patients with spontaneous regression of their cardiac hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: RASopathy-associated HCM is a heterogeneous genetic condition characterized by early-onset cardiac hypertrophy and a high prevalence of co-existing congenital heart disease, which is most frequently related to specific mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Rapidly progressive HCM, resulting in an early death, is uncommon in RASopathy patients except those with specific mutations in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Coronary telangiectasia (CT) is a rare congenital anomaly causing ventricular shunt and myocardial ischaemia. Its prevalence, genetic background, and impact in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are unknown and were therefore investigated in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 445 patients with HCM, 195 had a coronary angiography and 124 a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. CT draining into the ventricular cavities was observed in 5 of 195 HCM patients (2.5%), whereas it was detected in 0.1% of 1000 consecutive subjects without congenital anomalies undergoing coronary angiography. Patients with CT-HCM underwent a total body computed tomography scan to investigate the presence of systemic vascular malformations. HCM-related MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TPM1 genes and hereditary haemorragic telangiectasia-related endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 genes were analysed. Histology, clinical profile, and outcome of CT-HCM patients were correlated with those of 22 control HCM patients. No mucocutaneous or systemic vascular malformations were detected. Gene analysis showed a MYH7 mutation in two patients, with an associated endoglin point mutation. Histology showed in the CT-HCM cohort a more pronounced myocardial fibrosis (29.8 ± 3.8%) compared with HCM controls (13 ± 2.6%), and disorganized cardiomyocytes separated by thin-walled large vessels adherent to the endocardium. Clinically, the CT-HCM cohort had a higher arrhythmic profile at diagnosis and increased incidence of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantations and arrhythmic deaths during a long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: CT is detectable in 2.5% of HCM patients vs. 0.1% of the general population; it may derive from a co-existing endoglin gene mutation and cause a prominent, potentially arrhythmogenic myocardial fibrosis.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The pathogenicity of the different genetic variants causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the genotype/phenotype correlations are difficult to assess in clinical practice, as most mutations are unique or identified in non-informative families. Pathogenic variants in the sarcomeric gene MYBPC3 inherited with an autosomal dominant pattern, whereas incomplete and age-dependent penetrance are the most common causes of HCM. METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of a new truncating MYBPC3 variant, p.Val931Glyfs*120, in 75 subjects from 18 different families from northern Spain with the p.Val931Glyfs*120 variant. RESULTS: Our cohort allows us to estimate the penetrance and prognosis of this variant. The penetrance of the disease increases with age, whereas 50% of males in our sample developed HCM by the age of 36 years old, and 50% of women developed the disease by the time they reached 48 years of age (p = 0.104). Men have more documented arrhythmias with potential risk of sudden death (p = 0.018), requiring implantation of cardioverter defibrillators (p = 0.024). Semi-professional/competitive sport among males is related to earlier onset of HCM (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The p.Val931Glyfs*120 truncating variant in MYBPC3 is associated with a moderate phenotype of HCM, with a high penetrance, onset in middle age, and a worse outcome in males due to higher risk of sudden death due to arrhythmias.",

The aim of the current study was to report the frequency of single and multiple gene mutations in a large French cohort of HCM patients and to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms previously suggested to be potential disease modifiers in this myocardial pathology. We report the molecular screening of 192 unrelated HCM patients using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography/sequencing analysis of the MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2 and TNNI3 genes. Genotyping of 6 gene polymorphisms previously reported as putative HCM modifiers (5 RAAS polymorphisms and TNF-α -308 G/A) was also performed. Seventy-five mutations were identified in 92 index patients (48%); 32 were novel. MYBPC3 mutations (25%) represent the most prevalent cause of inherited HCM whereas MYH7 mutations (12%) rank second in the pathogenesis. The onset age was older in patients carrying MYBPC3 mutations than in those with MYH7 mutations. The MYBPC3 IVS20-2A>G splice mutation was identified in 7% of our HCM population. Multiple gene mutations were identified in 9 probands (5%), highlighting the importance of screening other HCM-causing genes even after a first mutation has been identified, particularly in young patients with a severe phenotype. No single or cumulative genetic modifier effect could be evidenced in this HCM cohort.",

Although mutations in more than 20 genes have been reported to be associated with HCM thus far, the genetic backgrounds of most HCM patients are not fully understood. We performed a genetic analysis in a Chinese family that presented with HCM using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical data, family histories, and blood samples were collected from the proband and family members. Five patients showed typical clinical symptoms of HCM. One subject was the victim of sudden cardiac death. By NGS, we determined that these subjects with HCM symptoms carried a missense heterozygous genetic mutation c.2632C>A (p.V878L) in the myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) gene with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Individuals without this mutation showed no symptoms or cardiac structural abnormalities related to HCM. Bioinformatics evaluation predicted this mutant as \"damaging\" and \"disease causing\". Additionally, sequence alignment showed that this mutant is located in an evolutionarily conserved region of MYH7 in multiple species. Our results describe a potentially pathogenic mutation associated with HCM, which may extend the spectrum of HCM phenotypes related to MYH7 gene mutations.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Clinical phenotypes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) vary greatly even among patients with the same gene mutations. This variability is largely regulated by unidentified modifier loci. The purpose of the study is to identify modifier genes for cardiac fibrosis-a major phenotype of HCM-using the BXD family, a murine cohort. METHODS: The relative severity of cardiac fibrosis was estimated by quantitation of cardiac collagen volume fraction (CCVF) across 66 members of the BXD family. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for cardiac fibrosis was done using GeneNetwork. Candidate modifier loci and genes associated with fibrosis were prioritized based on an explicit scoring system. Networks of correlation between fibrosis and cardiac transcriptomes were evaluated to generate causal models of disease susceptibility. RESULTS: CCVF levels varied greatly within this family. Interval mapping identified a significant CCVF-related QTL on chromosome (Chr) 2 in males, and a significant QTL on Chr 4 Mb in females. The scoring system highlighted two strong candidate genes in the Chr 2 locus-Nek6 and Nr6a1. Both genes are highly expressed in the heart. Cardiac Nek6 mRNA levels are significantly correlated with CCVF. Nipsnap3b and Fktn are lead candidate genes for the Chr 4 locus, and both are also highly expressed in heart. Cardiac Nipsnap3b gene expression correlates well with CCVF. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that candidate modifier genes of cardiac fibrosis phenotype in HCM are different in males and females. Nek6 and Nr6a1 are strong candidates in males, while Nipsnap3b and Fktn are top candidates in females.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and myocardial disarray. HCM is caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes, but in >40% of patients, the mutation is not yet identified. We hypothesized that FHL1, encoding four-and-a-half-LIM domains 1, could be another disease gene since it has been shown to cause distinct myopathies, sometimes associated with cardiomyopathy. We evaluated 121 HCM patients, devoid of a mutation in known disease genes. We identified three novel variants in FHL1 (c.134delA/K45Sfs, c.459C>A/C153X and c.827G>C/C276S). Whereas the c.459C>A variant was associated with muscle weakness in some patients, the c.134delA and c.827G>C variants were associated with isolated HCM. Gene transfer of the latter variants in C2C12 myoblasts and cardiac myocytes revealed reduced levels of FHL1 mutant proteins, which could be rescued by proteasome inhibition. Contractility measurements after adeno-associated virus transduction in rat-engineered heart tissue (EHT) showed: (i) higher and lower forces of contraction with K45Sfs and C276S, respectively, and (ii) prolonged contraction and relaxation with both mutants. All mutants except one activated the fetal hypertrophic gene program in EHT. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for FHL1 to be a novel gene for isolated HCM. These data, together with previous findings of proteasome impairment in HCM, suggest that FHL1 mutant proteins may act as poison peptides, leading to hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and/or altered contractility, all features of HCM.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: 34 hypertrophic subjects carrying the MYBPC3-Q1061X mutation, 19 non-hypertrophic mutation carriers and 20 relatives with neither mutation nor hypertrophy were examined using comprehensive echocardiography. Plasma was analyzed for molecular lipids and polar metabolites using two metabolomics platforms. Concentrations of branched chain amino acids, triglycerides and ether phospholipids were increased in mutation carriers with hypertrophy as compared to controls and non-hypertrophic mutation carriers, and correlated with echocardiographic LVH and signs of diastolic and systolic dysfunction in subjects with the MYBPC3-Q1061X mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implicates the potential role of branched chain amino acids, triglycerides and ether phospholipids in HCM, as well as suggests an association of these metabolites with remodeling and dysfunction of the left ventricle.",

The present study investigated the long noncoding (lnc)RNA/microRNA (mi)RNA/mRNA expression pattern of patients with HCM and aimed to identify key molecules involved in the development of this condition. An integrated strategy was conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs), differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the GSE36961 (mRNA), GSE36946 (miRNA), GSE68316 (lncRNA/mRNA) and GSE32453 (mRNA) expression profiles downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Bioinformatics tools were employed to perform function and pathway enrichment analysis, protein‑protein interaction, lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA and hub gene networks. Subsequently, DEGs were used as targets to predict drugs. The results indicated that a total of 2,234 DElncs (1,120 upregulated and 1,114 downregulated), 5 DEmiRs (2 upregulated and 3 downregulated) and 42 DEGs (35 upregulated and 7 downregulated) were identified in 4 microarray profiles. Gene ontology analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly involved in actin filament and stress fiber formation and in calcium ion binding, whereas Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis identified the hypoxia inducible factor‑1, transforming growth factor‑β and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways as the main pathways involved in these processes. The hub genes were screened using cytoHubba. A total of 1,086 lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA interactions including 67 lncRNAs, 5 miRNAs and 25 mRNAs were mined in the present study based on prediction websites. Drug prediction indicated that the targeted drugs mainly included angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or β‑blockers. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the molecular regulatory lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA network was performed and potential therapeutic applications of drugs were predicted in HCM patients. The data may unravel the future molecular mechanism of HCM.",

These mutations produce dysfunctional protein that is quickly degraded and not incorporated in the myofilaments. Most patients are heterozygous and allelic expression differs between cells. We hypothesized that this would lead to cell-to-cell variation in cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C, encoded by MYBPC3 gene) protein levels. METHODS: Twelve HCM patients were included (six had no sarcomere mutations (HCMsmn) and served as the control group and six harbored mutations in the MYBPC3 gene (MYBPC3mut). Western blot and RNA sequencing analysis of cardiac tissue lysates were performed to detect overall cMyBP-C protein and mRNA levels. Cellular expression of cMyBP-C and α-actin was obtained by immunofluorescence staining. Quantification of cell-to-cell variation of cMyBP-C expression between cardiomyocytes was measured by determining the ratio of cMyBP-C:α-actin stained area of each cell. RESULTS: Protein and mRNA analysis revealed significantly reduced cMyBP-C levels in MYBPC3mut patients compared with HCMsmn patients (0.73 ± 0.09 vs. 1.0 ± 0.15, p < .05; 162.3 ± 16.4 vs. 326.2 ± 41.9 RPKM, p = .002), without any sign of truncated proteins. Immunofluorescence staining of individual cardiomyocytes in HCMsmn patients demonstrated homogenous and equal cMyBP-C:α-actin staining ratio. In contrast, MYBPC3mut patients demonstrated inhomogeneous staining patterns with a large intercellular variability per patient. Coefficient of variance for cMyBP-C/α-actin staining for each patient showed a significant difference between both groups (17.30 ± 4.08 vs. 5.18 ± 0.65% in MYBPC3mut vs. HCMsmn, p = .02).

Variants in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins are mainly responsible for the disease. MYH7 gene encoding a myosin heavy chain beta, together with MYPBC3 gene are the two most commonly affected genes. The clinical presentation of this disease varies widely between individuals. This study aims to report a variant of MYH7 responsible for HCM in a five-generation family with a history of cardiac problems. Methods: The diagnosis was established according to the European Society of Cardiology HCM criteria based on two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Genetic analysis was performed using next-generation-sequencing and Sanger method. Results: The medical history of the presented family began with a prenatal diagnosis of HCM in the first child of a family with previously healthy parents. Five generations of the family had a long history of sudden cardiac death and cardiac problems. A NM_000257.4:c.2342T>A (p.Leu781Gln) variant was detected in the MYH7 gene. It was heterozygous in the proband and in all affected individuals in a large family. The variant was present in 10 affected members of the family, and was absent in 7 members. The clinical course of the disease was severe in several members of the family: three family members died of sudden cardiac death, one patient required heart transplantation, three underwent septal myectomy, and three required implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Conclusion: Herein, we report a MYH7 variant responsible for HCM. Familial HCM is inherited primarily in autosomal dominant mode, which is in accordance with our study. However, the presented family showed a broad clinical spectrum of HCM. Out of 10 family members with positive genetic testing 8 had severe presentation of the disease and 2 had a mild phenotype. This suggests that the severity of the disease may depend on other factors, most likely genetic.",

        "Abstract Note": "RATIONALE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a prototypic single-gene disease caused mainly by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Despite the remarkable advances, the causal genes in ≈40% of the HCM cases remain unknown, typically in small families and sporadic cases, wherein cosegregation could not be established. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the missing causal genes in HCM is, in part, because of an oligogenic cause, wherein the pathogenic variants do not cosegregate with the phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS: A clinically affected trio with HCM underwent clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and whole exome sequencing. Pathogenic variants in the whole exome sequencing data were identified using established algorithms. Family members were genotyped by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation was analyzed. The siblings had a severe course, whereas the mother had a mild course. Variant analysis showed that the trio shared 145 heterozygous pathogenic variants in 139 genes, including 2 in cardiomyopathy genes TTN and ALPK3. The siblings also had the pathogenic variant p.Ala13Thr variant in MYL2, a known gene for HCM. The sibling's father also carried the p.Ala13Thr variant, in whom an unambiguous diagnosis of HCM could not be made because of concomitant severe aortic stenosis. The TTN variant segregated with HCM, except in a 7-year-old boy, who had a normal phenotype. The ALPK3 variant, shared by the affected trio, did not segregate with the phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We posit that a subset of HCM might be oligogenic caused by multiple pathogenic variants that do not perfectly cosegregate with the phenotype.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins (excluding phenocopy). The causal genes in approximately one-third of the cases remain unknown. We identified a family comprised of 6 clinically affected members. The phenotype was characterized by early onset of symptoms, pronounced cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac arrhythmias. We excluded MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and ACTC1 as the causal gene either by direct sequencing or by haplotype analysis. To map the putative candidate sarcomeric gene, we perforbold locus-specific haplotyping to detect cosegregation of the locus haplotype with the phenotype, followed by mutation screening. We genotyped 5 short-tandem-repeat markers that spanned a 4.4-centimorgan region on 4q26-q27 locus and encompassed myozenin 2 (MYOZ2), a Z-disk protein. The maximum logarithm of odds score was 2.03 (P=0.005). All affected members shared a common haplotype, implicating MYOZ2 as the causal gene. To detect the causal mutation, we sequenced all exons and exon-intron boundaries of MYOZ2 in 10 family members and identified a T-->C missense mutation corresponding to S48P substitution, which cosegregated with inheritance of HCM (N=6). It was absent in 4 clinically normal family members and in 658 additional normal individuals. To determine frequency of the MYOZ2 mutations in HCM, we sequenced MYOZ2 in 516 HCM probands and detected another missense mutation (I246M). It was absent in 2 normal family members and 517 controls. Both mutations affect highly conserved amino acids. We conclude MYOZ2 is a novel causal gene for human HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential utility of genetic diagnosis in clinical management of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by mutations in the gene for cardiac troponin I (TNNI3). BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the clinical disease expression of sarcomeric gene mutations in HCM has predominantly been obtained by investigations of single individuals (probands) or selected families. To establish the role of genetic diagnosis in HCM families, systematic investigations of probands and their relatives are needed. METHODS: Cardiac troponin I was investigated by direct sequencing and fluorescent (F)-SSCP analysis in 748 consecutive HCM families. Relatives of HCM probands with TNNI3 mutations were invited for cardiovascular and genetic assessment. RESULTS: The prevalence of TNNI3 mutations was 3.1%. Mutations appeared to cluster in exons 7 and 8. A total of 100 mutation carriers were identified in 23 families with 13 different mutations (6 novel). Disease penetrance was 48%. Patients were diagnosed from the second to eighth decade of life. The morphologic spectrum observed represented a wide range of HCM. Two offspring of clinically unaffected mutation carriers were resuscitated from cardiac arrest, and an additional four individuals died suddenly as their initial presentation. Six individuals experienced other disease-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical expression of TNNI3 mutations was very heterogeneous and varied both within and between families with no apparent mutation- or gene-specific disease pattern. The data suggest that disease development may be monitored by regular assessment of cardiac symptoms and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Genetic diagnosis of TNNI3 is valuable in identifying clinically unaffected mutation carriers at risk of disease development and facilitates accurate management and counseling.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac disorder that affects over one in 500 persons worldwide. The autosomal dominant transmission of HCM implies that many relatives are at risk for HCM associated morbidity and mortality, therefore genetic testing and counselling is of great importance. However, in only 50-60% of the patients a mutation is found, which hampers predictive genetic testing in relatives. In HCM patients in whom the causal mutation has not been identified (yet), phenocopies of HCM - i.e. diseases that mimic HCM - could be responsible for the HCM phenotype. One of the HCM phenocopies is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. METHODS: From 697 HCM index patients referred to our cardiogenetics outpatient clinic and tested for HCM associated genes between January 1997 and December 2012, we selected the ones without a detected causal mutation (n = 345). In these patients, additional DNA analysis of the TTR gene was performed. RESULTS: In four patients (1.2%), a TTR mutation was detected (E7G, V30M, T119M, V122I). The E7G mutation is probably a non-pathogenic mutation. The T119M mutation is a known TTR mutation, but does not cause a cardiac phenotype. So in two (0.6%) patients, TTR analysis identified the cause of their HCM. CONCLUSIONS: ATTR should always be considered in patients with unexplained HCM, especially because of the great benefit of an early diagnosis regarding treatment and prognosis.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Genetic mutations are the most common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and an increasingly recognized cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. Autosomal dominant HCM is caused by mutations in sarcomere proteins; such mutations are not universally present, however, and fail to account for &40% of cases of phenotypic HCM. To add further complexity, other genetic origins can mimic the gross clinical phenotype of HCM, and mutations in sarcomere genes have been demonstrated to cause dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: To explore novel genetic causes of inherited cardiomyopathies, genome-wide linkage analysis was used to study one kindred (4 generations, 32 individuals) with predominant clinical features of left ventricular hypertrophy in addition to cardiac dilation, end-stage heart failure, and sudden death. Of note, histopathology from 2 family members did not demonstrate myocyte disarray and fibrosis, indicating that this phenotype is not typical sarcomere mutation HCM. Direct DNA sequencing was performed on sarcomere genes known to cause HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy, and no mutations were identified. Linkage was then established to a novel locus on chromosome 7 (7p12.1-7q21). A maximum 2-point logarithm of odds score of 4.11 was obtained. Recombination events refine the disease interval between D7S506 and D7S3314, corresponding to a distance of 27.2 megabases. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of a novel genetic locus in this family provides more evidence that molecular pathways leading to inherited cardiac hypertrophy extend beyond the sarcomere. Identification of the causal gene mutation and additional genotype-phenotype correlation studies will provide fundamental insight into mechanisms of cardiac remodeling.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore a novel disease gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and to evaluate functional alterations caused by mutations. BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes encoding myofilaments or Z-disc proteins of the cardiac sarcomere cause HCM, but the disease-causing mutations can be found in one-half of the patients, indicating that novel HCM-susceptibility genes await discovery. We studied a candidate gene, ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1), encoding for the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP) that is a Z-disc component interacting with N2A domain of titin/connectin and N-terminal domain of myopalladin. METHODS: We analyzed 384 HCM patients for mutations in ANKRD1 and in the N2A domain of titin/connectin gene (TTN). Interaction of CARP with titin/connectin or myopalladin was investigated using coimmunoprecipitation assay to demonstrate the functional alteration caused by ANKRD1 or TTN mutations. Functional abnormalities caused by the ANKRD1 mutations were also examined at the cellular level in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: Three ANKRD1 missense mutations, Pro52Ala, Thr123Met, and Ile280Val, were found in 3 patients. All mutations increased binding of CARP to both titin/connectin and myopalladin. In addition, TTN mutations, Arg8500His, and Arg8604Gln in the N2A domain were found in 2 patients, and these mutations increased binding of titin/connectin to CARP. Myc-tagged CARP showed that the mutations resulted in abnormal localization of CARP in cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: CARP abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCM.",

Although the majority of mutations are found in the MYH7 and MYBPC3 genes, mutations in Z-disk-associated proteins have also been linked to HCM. METHODS: We assessed a small family with HCM based on family history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging. After exclusion of mutations in eleven HCM disease genes, we performed direct sequencing of the TCAP gene encoding the Z-disk protein titin-cap (also known as telethonin). RESULTS: We present a novel TCAP mutation in a small family affected by HCM. The identified p.C57W mutation showed a very low population frequency, as well as high conservation across species. All of the bioinformatic prediction tools used considered this mutation to be damaging/deleterious. Family members were screened for this new mutation and a co-segregation pattern was detected. Both affected members of this family presented with late-onset HCM, moderate asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and low risk of sudden cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence supporting the classification of the TCAP p.C57W mutation, encoding the Z-disk protein titin-cap/telethonin as a new likely pathogenic variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a specific phenotype in the family under analysis.",

        "Abstract Note": "Despite advances by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), much of heritability of common human diseases remains missing, a phenomenon referred to as 'missing heritability'. One potential cause for 'missing heritability' is the rare susceptibility variants overlooked by GWAS. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia seen at hospitals and increases risk of stroke by fivefold and doubles risk of heart failure and sudden death. Here, we studied one large Chinese family with AF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Whole-exome sequencing analysis identified a mutation in TNNI3, R186Q, that co-segregated with the disease in the family, but did not exist in >1583 controls, suggesting that R186Q causes AF and HCM. High-resolution melting curve analysis and direct DNA sequence analysis were then used to screen mutations in all exons and exon-intron boundaries of TNNI3 in a panel of 1127 unrelated AF patients and 1583 non-AF subjects. Four novel missense variants were identified in TNNI3, including E64G, M154L, E187G and D196G in four independent AF patients, but no variant was found in 1583 non-AF subjects. All variants were not found in public databases, including the ExAC Browser database with 60,706 exomes. These data suggest that rare TNNI3 variants are associated with AF (P = 0.03). TNNI3 encodes troponin I, a key regulator of the contraction-relaxation function of cardiac muscle and was not previously implicated in AF. Thus, this study may identify a new biological pathway for the pathogenesis of AF and provides evidence to support the rare variant hypothesis for missing heritability.",

It has been reported that the mutations in the MYH6 gene associated with sinus venosus atrial septal defect (ASD type III), hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies. METHODS: Two patients in an Iranian family have been identified who affected to Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). The male patient, besides CHD, shows that the thyroglossal sinus, refractive errors of the eye and mitral stenosis. The first symptoms emerged at the birth and diagnosis based on clinical features was made at about 5 years. The family had a history of ASD. For recognizing mutated gene (s), whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for the male patient and variants were analyzed by autosomal dominant inheritance mode. RESULTS: Eventually, by several filtering processes, a mutation in MYH6 gene (NM_002471.3), c.3835C > T; R1279X, was identified as the most likely disease-susceptibility variant and then confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the family. The mutation frequency was checked out in the local databases. This mutation results in the elimination of the 660 amino acids in the C-terminal of Myosin VI protein, including the vital parts of the coiled-coil structure of the tail domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first case of Sinus venosus defect caused directly by MYH6 stop codon mutation. Our data indicate that by increase haploinsufficiency of myosin VI, c.3835C > T mutation with reduced penetrance could be associated with CHD.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited cardiac disorder, is characterized by increased ventricular wall thickness that cannot be explained by underlying conditions, cadiomyocyte hypertrophy and disarray, and increased myocardial fibrosis. In as many as 50% of HCM cases, the genetic cause remains unknown, suggesting that more genes may be involved. Nexilin, encoded by NEXN, is a cardiac Z-disc protein recently identified as a crucial protein that functions to protect cardiac Z-discs from forces generated within the sarcomere. We screened NEXN in 121 unrelated HCM patients who did not carry any mutation in eight genes commonly mutated in myofilament disease. Two missense mutations, c.391C>G (p.Q131E) and c.835C>T (p.R279C), were identified in exons 5 and 8 of NEXN, respectively, in two probands. Each of the two mutations segregated with the HCM phenotype in the family and was absent in 384 control chromosomes. In silico analysis revealed that both of the mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues, which are predicted to be functionally deleterious. Cellular transfection studies showed that the two mutations resulted in local accumulations of nexilin and that the expressed fragment of actin-binding domain containing p.Q131E completely lost the ability to bind F-actin in C2C12 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that the p.Q131E mutation decreased the binding of full-length NEXN to α-actin and abolished the interaction between the fragment of actin-binding domain and α-actin. Therefore, the mutations in NEXN that we describe here may further expand the knowledge of Z-disc genes in the pathogenesis of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Mutations causing familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been described in at least 11 genes encoding cardiac sarcomeric proteins. In this study, three previously unknown deletions have been identified in the human cardiac genes coding for beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7 on chromosome 14) and myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3 on chromosome 11). In family MM, a 3-bp deletion in MYH7 was detected to be associated with loss of glutamic acid in position 927 (DeltaE927) of the myosin rod. In two other families (HH and NP, related by a common founder) a 2-bp loss in codon 453 (exon 16) of MYBPC3 was identified as the presumable cause of a translation reading frame shift. Taken together 15 living mutation carriers were investigated. Six deceased family members (with five cases of premature sudden cardiac death (SCD) in families MM and NP) were either obligate or suspected mutation carriers. In addition to these mutations a 25-bp deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 was identified in family MM (five carriers) and in a fourth family (MiR, one HCM patient, three deletion carriers). In agreement with the loss of the regular splicing branch point in the altered intron 32, a splicing deficiency was observed in an exon trapping experiment using MYBPC3 exon 33 as a test substrate. Varying disease profiles assessed using standard clinical, ECG and echocardiographic procedures in conjunction with mutation analysis led to the following conclusions: (1) In family MM the DeltaE927 deletion in MYH7 was assumed to be associated with complete penetrance. Two cases of reported SCD might have been related to this mutation. (2) The two families, HH and NP, distantly related by a common founder, and both suffering from a 2-bp deletion in exon 16 of MYBPC3 differed in their average phenotypes. In family NP, four cases of cardiac death were documented, whereas no cardiac-related death was reported from family HH. These results support the notion that mutations in HCM genes may directly determine disease penetrance and severity; however, a contribution of additional, unidentified factors (genes) to the HCM phenotype can-at least in some cases-not be excluded. (3) The deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 was seen in two families, but in both its relation to disease was not unequivocal. In addition, this deletion was observed in 16 of 229 unrelated healthy individuals of the population of the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It was not seen in 270 Caucasians from Russia and western Europe. Hence, it is considered to represent a regional genetic polymorphism restricted to southern India. The association of the deletion with altered splicing in transfected cells suggests that this deletion may create a \"modifying gene\", which is per se not or only rarely causing HCM, but which may enhance the phenotype of a mutation responsible for disease.",

The disease bearing genes for HCM in HCM families have been identified as beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-tropomyosin, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and myosin binding protein-C genes. In the present study, we searched for the mutations in the cTnT gene in Japanese HCM patients. Single-strand conformation polymorphism gel analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified product was used to search for the mutations in the exons 8, 9 and 15 of the cTnT gene from 60 familial HCM patients. Clinical studies of the family members were performed and the incidence of sudden or disease-related deaths within the family was also examined. We have identified a novel missense mutation in exon 9 (Ala104Val) of the cTnT gene in a patient with familial HCM. Because the missense mutation was found at the residue conserved through chicken to humans and was not detected in the more than 50 normal controls, it was suggested that this missense mutation is the cause of HCM in this family. Although the affected family members presented moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall, they were symptomatic and there was a high incidence of sudden death in her family members. Among Japanese patients with familial HCM, a novel missense mutation (Ala104Val) in the cTnT gene was identified. Familial HCM is genetically heterogeneous in Japanese HCM patients as observed in Caucasian kindreds. The disease in the kindred was severe and there was a high incidence of sudden or disease-related deaths in the kindred with this mutation.",

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by asymmetric cardiac hypertrophy due to inherited mutations in genes that encode sarcomeric proteins. MYH7, which encodes β-myosin heavy chain, is among the most commonly mutated genes in patients affected by HCM. We aimed to identify the specific mutation responsible for HCM in a six-month old Caucasian patient. NextGen DNA sequencing revealed a novel p.Ala1328Thr (A1328T) mutation of MYH7 in the affected patient as well as his asymptomatic father and asymptomatic brother. The clinical details of this mutation are described for the first time in this report. The genetic variant affects a residue that is highly conserved across species. Theoretical analysis suggests that A1328T is very likely deleterious to β-myosin heavy chain protein structure and function. Furthermore, this novel mutation was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 healthy individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, underlining the potential pathogenicity of this variant.",

        "Abstract Note": "We describe a male patient affected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with no point mutations in the eight sarcomeric genes most commonly involved in the disease. By multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) we have identified a multi-exons C-terminus deletion in the cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene. The rearrangement has been confirmed by long PCR and breakpoints have been defined by sequencing. The 3.5 kb terminal deletion is mediated by Alu-repeat elements and is predicted to result in haploinsufficiency of MYBPC3. To exclude the presence of other rare pathogenic variants in additional HCM genes, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 88 cardiomyopathy-associated genes but we did not identify any further mutation. Interestingly, the MYBPC3 multi-exons deletion was detectable by NGS. This finding broadens the range of mutational spectrum observed in HCM, contributing to understanding the genetic basis of the most common inherited cardiovascular disease. Moreover, our data suggest that NGS may represent a new tool to achieve a deeper insight into molecular basis of complex diseases, allowing to detect in a single experiment both point mutations and gene rearrangements.",

This study analyzed the clinical and genetic characteristics of a Vietnamese CMT family that was affected by a novel GDAP1 mutation. METHODS: We present three children of a family with progressive weakness, mild sensory loss, and absent tendon reflexes. Electrodiagnostic analyses displayed an axonal type of neuropathy in affected patients. Sequencing of GDAP1 gene was requested for all members of the family. RESULTS: All affected individuals manifested identical clinical symptoms of motor and sensory impairments within the first three years of life, and nerve conduction study indicated the axonal degeneration. A homozygous GDAP1 variant (c.667_671dup) was found in the three affected children as recessive inheritance pattern. The mutation leads to a premature termination codon that shortens GDAP1 protein (p.Gln224Hisfs∗37). Further testing showed heterozygous c.667_671dup variant in the parents. DISCUSSION: Our study expands the mutational spectrum of GDAP1-related CMT disease with the new and unreported GDAP1 variant. Alterations in GDAP1 gene should be evaluated as CMT causing variants in the Vietnamese population, predominantly axonal form of neuropathy in CMT disease.",

MYBPC3 mutations are reported as a frequent cause of HCM. We aimed to identify the gene mutation underlying HCM in an Italian patient and his family composed of 13 relatives. Mutation screening of 658 known mutations was performed using a rapid and efficient mutation detection system based on semiautomated MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using the Sequenom MassArray System and iPLEX Gold genotyping chemistry. Subsequently, direct sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic regions was performed for the most suitable HCM genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, and TPM1) in the index patient. We found a novel MYBPC3 gene mutation: G13999T (Gln689His). No other sarcomere gene mutation was found in this family. This genetic variant, which changes the last amino acid of MYBPC3 exon 21, affects a highly conserved residue. Furthermore, the Gln689His does not appear in public databases and has never been described as a polymorphism. The potential pathogenic role of this novel mutation was underlined by its absence in a sample of healthy subjects (n = 122) from the general Italian population. In summary, a novel MYBPC3 gene mutation has been identified in a patient affected by HCM, whereas it was absent in 244 reference alleles.",

We analysed the MYH7 gene in three generations of a family with one borderline and four clinically verified cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and identified a mutation in exon 7 changing the 190 arginine residue into a threonine residue. The mutation is located in the ATP-binding region of the myosin head and alters the charge in the F-helix close to the phosphate-binding P-loop. The mutation may thus interfere with the coupling between ATP-hydrolysis and the transition into mechanical energy.

        "Abstract Note": "Cardiomyopathy is a major cause of heart failure and sudden cardiac death; several mutations in sarcomeric protein genes have been associated with this disease. Our aim in the present study is to investigate the genetic variations in Troponin T (cTnT) gene and its association with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in south-Indian patients. Analyses of all the exons and exon-intron boundaries of cTnT in 147 DCM and in 207 healthy controls had revealed a total of 15 SNPs and a 5 bp INDEL; of which, polymorphic SNPs were compared with the HapMap population data. Interestingly, a novel R144W mutation, that substitutes polar-neutral tryptophan for a highly conserved basic arginine in cTnT, altering the charge drastically, was identified in a DCM, with a family history of sudden-cardiac death (SCD). This mutation was found within the tropomyosin (TPM1) binding domain, and was evolutionarily conserved across species, therefore it is expected to have a significant impact on the structure and function of the protein. Family studies had revealed that the R144W is co-segregating with disease in the family as an autosomal dominant trait, but it was completely absent in 207 healthy controls and in 162 previously studied HCM patients. Further screening of the proband and three of his family members (positive for R144W mutant) with eight other genes β-MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNI3, TTN, ACTC, MYL2 and MYL3, did not reveal any disease causing mutation, proposing the absence of compound heterozygosity. Therefore, we strongly suggest that the novel R144W unique/private mutant identified in this study is associated with FDCM. This is furthermore signifying the unique genetic architecture of Indian population.",

        "Abstract Note": "Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) is an autosomal dominant disease affecting primarily the myocardium. The gene responsible for FHCM has been localized to chromosome 14 in some families and several mutations have been described in the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta MHC), a candidate gene for the disease. We recently identified a family with HCM in whom we did not detect any of the known mutations in the beta MHC gene (the alpha/beta MHC hybrid gene and the missense mutation in exons 13 and 9). However, we did observe a novel 9.5-kb BamHI restriction fragment length polymorphism detected by a beta MHC probe on Southern blots of DNA from the proband of this family. Similarly, a novel 3.8-kb TaqI polymorphism and a novel 4.3-kb HindIII polymorphism were detected on Southern blots of DNA from the same proband. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the segment of the beta MHC that was detected by pSC14 probe. PCR amplification of the distal 3'-end of the beta MHC gene yielded an additional product in the DNA template from the proband which was subsequently cloned and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed a 2.4-kb nucleotide deletion involving one allele of the beta MHC gene. The deletion includes part of the intron 39, exon 40 including the 3'-untranslated region and the polyadenylation signal, and part of the beta-alpha MHC intergenic region. This deletion was inherited in Mendelian fashion in an additional three members of this small family of which only the proband has developed clinically diagnosed HCM at a very late onset (age 59 yr), the other three family members are younger and have not developed the disease at the ages of 10, 32, and 33 yr.",

The proband was followed closely from age 6 to 17 years, revealing a natural history of the progression of clinical findings associated with HCM. Genetic testing of the proband and her natural mother, who is affected by HCM, revealed that they were heterozygous for both the R719Q and T1513S variants in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) gene. The proband's ominous family history indicates that the combination of the R719Q and T1513S variants in cis may be a \"malignant\" variant that imparts a poor prognosis in terms of the disease progression and SCD risk.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by inherited defects of sarcomeric proteins. We tested the hypothesis that homozygosity for a sarcomeric protein defect can cause recessive HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a family with early-onset cardiomyopathy in 3 siblings, characterized by mid-cavitary hypertrophy and restrictive physiology. Genotyping of DNA markers spanning 8 genes for autosomal dominant HCM revealed inheritance of an identical paternal and maternal haplotype at the essential light chain of myosin locus by the affected children. Sequencing showed that these individuals were homozygous for a Glu143Lys substitution of a highly conserved amino acid that was absent in 150 controls. Family members with one Glu143Lys allele had normal echocardiograms and ECGs, even in late adulthood, whereas those with two mutant alleles developed severe cardiomyopathy in childhood. These findings, coupled with previous studies of myosin light chain structure and function in the heart, suggest a loss-of-function disease mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct mutations affecting the same sarcomeric protein can cause either dominant or recessive cardiomyopathy. Electrostatic charge reversal of a highly conserved amino acid may be benign in the heterozygous state as the result of compensatory mechanisms that preserve cardiac structure and function. By contrast, homozygous carriers of a sarcomeric protein defect may have a malignant course. Recognizing recessive inheritance in children with cardiomyopathy is essential for appropriate family counseling.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: We investigated cardiac energetics in subjects with mutations in three different familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) disease genes, some of whom were nonpenetrant carriers without hypertrophy, using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. BACKGROUND: Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations in sarcomeric protein genes. The mechanism by which these mutant proteins cause disease is uncertain. A defect of myocyte contractility had been proposed, but in vitro studies of force generation have subsequently shown opposing results in different classes of mutation. An alternative hypothesis of \"energy compromise\" resulting from inefficient utilization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been suggested, but in vivo data in humans with genotyped HCM are lacking. METHODS: The cardiac phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP ratio was determined at rest in 31 patients harboring mutations in the genes for either beta-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, or myosin-binding protein C, and in 24 controls. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular (LV) dimensions and maximal wall thickness. RESULTS: The PCr/ATP was reduced in the HCM subjects by 30% relative to controls (1.70 +/- 0.43 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.30; p < 0.001), and the reduction was of a similar magnitude in all three disease-gene groups. The PCr/ATP was equally reduced in subjects with (n = 24) and without (n = 7) LV hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence of a bioenergetic deficit in genotype-confirmed HCM, which is present to a similar degree in three disease-gene groups. The presence of energetic abnormalities, even in those without hypertrophy, supports a proposed link between altered cardiac energetics and development of the disease phenotype.",

One of the most commonly mutated HCM genes is the myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene.

Pure HCM in neonates is rare and most of the time childhood HCM occurs in association with another underlying condition.

METHODS: MYBPC3 coding region and splice junction variation were analysed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing in DNA isolated from two neonates with severe unexplained HCM, who died within the first weeks of life. RESULTS: Truncating mutations were found in both alleles of the MYBPC3 gene in both patients, suggesting there was no functional copy of the MYBPC3 protein. Patient 1 carried the maternally inherited c.2373_2374insG mutation and the paternally inherited splice-donor site mutation c.1624+1G-->A. Patient 2 carried the maternally inherited frameshift mutation c.3288delA (p.Glu1096fsX92) and the paternally inherited non-sense mutation c.2827C-->T (p.Arg943X). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the need for mutation analysis of genes encoding sarcomeric proteins in childhood HCM and the possibility of compound heterozygosity.",

        "Abstract Note": "Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by café-au-lait spots, intertriginous freckling, and multiple neurofibromas. Classically, it has been described that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be a cardiovascular manifestation of neurofibromatosis 1, although the relationship between these two entities has not been fully established. We report a large Spanish family carrying a pathogenic truncating variant in NF1 (p.Arg2258Ter) causing neurofibromatosis 1, and a pathogenic missense variant in MYH7 (p. Arg453Cys), causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy independently. A complete penetrance was observed in both genetic diseases, reinforcing the notion of deleterious effects of both rare variants. According to our report, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in patients with NF1 should not be considered as part of the clinical spectrum in all cases. A careful and comprehensive assessment, including family evaluation and genetic testing for HCM should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up in individuals presenting with both phenotypes.",

In this study, we performed high-resolution single-cell RNA-sequencing of 2115 individual cardiomyocytes obtained from HCM patients and normal controls.

Using our high-resolution dataset, we also investigated the heterogeneity among individual cardiomyocytes and revealed five distinct clusters within HCM cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, we showed that some extracellular matrix (ECM) genes were up-regulated in the HCM cardiomyocytes, suggesting that they play a role in cardiac remodelling. Taken together, our study comprehensively profiled the transcriptomic programs of HCM cardiomyocytes and provided insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "The inherited cardiomyopathies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), have been frequently associated with mutations in sarcomeric proteins. In recent years, advances in DNA sequencing technology has allowed the study of the giant proteins of the sarcomere, such as titin and nebulin. Obscurin has been somewhat neglected in these studies, largely because its functional role is far from clear, although there was an isolated report in 2007 of obscurin mutations associated with HCM. Recently, whole exome sequencing methodology (WES) has been used to address mutations in OBSCN, the gene for obscurin, and OBSCN variants were found to be relatively common in inherited cardiomyopathies. In different studies, 5 OBSCN unique variants have been found in a group of 30 end-stage failing hearts, 6 OBSCN unique variants in 74 HCM cases and 3 OBSCN unique variants in 10 LVNC patients. As yet, the number of known potentially disease-causing OBSCN variants is quite small. The reason for this is that mutations in the OBSCN gene have not been recognised as potentially disease-causing until recently, and were not included in large-scale genetic surveys. OBSCN mutations may be causative of HCM, DCM and LVNC and other cardiomyopathies, or they may work in concert with other variants in the same or other genes to initiate the pathology. Currently, the function of obscurin is not well understood, but we anticipate that many more OBSCN variants linked to cardiomyopathy will be found when the large cohorts of patient sequences available are tested. It is to be hoped that the establishment of the importance of obscurin in pathology will stimulate a thorough investigation of obscurin function.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a frequent genetic cardiac disease and the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals. Most of the currently known HCM disease genes encode sarcomeric proteins. Previous studies have shown an association between CSRP3 missense mutations and either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM, but all these studies were unable to provide comprehensive genetic evidence for a causative role of CSRP3 mutations. We used linkage analysis and identified a CSRP3 missense mutation in a large German family affected by HCM. We confirmed CSRP3 as an HCM disease gene. Furthermore, CSRP3 missense mutations segregating with HCM were identified in four other families. We used a newly designed monoclonal antibody to show that muscle LIM protein (MLP), the protein encoded by CSRP3, is mainly a cytosolic component of cardiomyocytes and not tightly anchored to sarcomeric structures. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP's mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. We also present evidence for mild skeletal muscle disease in affected persons. Our results support the view that HCM is not exclusively a sarcomeric disease and also suggest that impaired mechano-sensory stress signalling might be involved in the pathogenesis of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiac disease. Signaling pathways that link genetic sequence variants to clinically overt HCM and progression to severe forms of HCM remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify signaling pathways that are differentially regulated in HCM, using proteomic profiling of human myocardium, confirmed with transcriptomic profiling. METHODS: In this multicenter case-control study, myocardial samples were obtained from cases with HCM and control subjects with nonfailing hearts. Proteomic profiling of 7,289 proteins from myocardial samples was performed using the SomaScan assay (SomaLogic). Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins was performed, using a false discovery rate <0.05. Pathway analysis of proteins whose concentrations correlated with clinical indicators of severe HCM (eg, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias) was also executed. Confirmatory analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using myocardial transcriptomic profiling. RESULTS: The study included 99 HCM cases and 15 control subjects. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed dysregulation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, angiogenesis-related (eg, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, vascular endothelial growth factor), and Hippo pathways. Pathways known to be dysregulated in HCM, including metabolic, inflammatory, and extracellular matrix pathways, were also dysregulated. Pathway analysis of proteins associated with clinical indicators of severe HCM and of differentially expressed genes supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The present study represents the most comprehensive (>7,000 proteins) and largest-scale (n = 99 HCM cases) proteomic profiling of human HCM myocardium to date. Proteomic profiling and confirmatory transcriptomic profiling elucidate dysregulation of both newly recognized (eg, Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase) and known pathways associated with pathogenesis and progression to severe forms of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to explore the relationship between a Tcap gene (TCAP) abnormality and cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cause severe heart failure and sudden death. Recent genetic investigations have revealed that mutations of genes encoding Z-disc components, including titin and muscle LIM protein (MLP), are the primary cause of both HCM and DCM. The Z-disc plays a role in establishing the mechanical coupling of sarcomeric contraction and stretching, with the titin/Tcap/MLP complex serving as a mechanical stretch sensor. Tcap interacts with the calsarcin, which tethers the calcineurin to the Z-disc. METHODS: The TCAP was analyzed in 346 patients with HCM (236 familial and 110 sporadic cases) and 136 patients with DCM (34 familial and 102 sporadic cases). Two different in vitro qualitative assays-yeast two-hybrid and glutathion S-transferase pull-down competition-were performed in order to investigate functional changes in Tcap's interaction with MLP, titin, and calsarcin-1 caused by the identified mutations and a reported DCM-associated mutation, R87Q. RESULTS: Two TCAP mutations, T137I and R153H, were found in patients with HCM, and another TCAP mutation, E132Q, was identified in a patient with DCM. It was demonstrated by the qualitative assays that the HCM-associated mutations augment the ability of Tcap to interact with titin and calsarcin-1, whereas the DCM-associated mutations impair the interaction of Tcap with MLP, titin, and calsarcin-1. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the difference in clinical phenotype (HCM or DCM) may be correlated with the property of altered binding among the Z-disc components.",

        "Abstract Note": "Background Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, the relationship between genetic variation and AF has been poorly defined. Characterizing genetic subtypes of HCM and their associations with AF may help to improve personalized medical care. We aimed to investigate the link between sarcomeric gene variation and incident AF in HCM patients. Methods and Results Patients from the multinational Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry were followed for incident AF. Those with likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in sarcomeric genes were included. The AF incidence was ascertained by review of medical records and electrocardiograms at each investigative site. One thousand forty adult HCM patients, without baseline AF and with likely pathogenic or pathogenic variation in either MYH7 (n=296), MYBPC3 (n=659), or thin filament genes (n=85), were included. Compared with patients with variation in other sarcomeric genes, those with MYH7 variants were younger on first clinical encounter at the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry site and more likely to be probands than the MYBPC3 variants. During an average follow-up of 7.2 years, 198 incident AF events occurred. Patients with likely pathogenic or pathogenic mutations in MYH7 had the highest incidence of AF after adjusting for age, sex, proband status, left atrial size, maximal wall thickness, and peak pressure gradient (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P=0.009). Conclusions During a mean follow-up of 7.2 years, new-onset AF developed in 19% of HCM patients with sarcomeric mutations. Compared with other sarcomeric genes, patients with likely pathogenic or pathogenic variation in MYH7 had a higher rate of incident AF independent of clinical and echocardiographic factors.",

To date, the clinical features and genetic causes of ILVNC remain unclear. Here, we report the clinical presentation and genetic analysis of a five generation Chinese family with ILVNC. METHODS: For this study, 21 living family members were recruited. Each individual underwent a detailed clinical examination for ILVNC. Peripheral blood samples were collected for direct gene sequencing to determine any mutations in the known disease-causing genes of ILVNC, which include the genes TAZ, DTNA, LDB3, LMNA and FKBP12. RESULTS: Classic echocardiographic presentation of ILVNC was identified in the proband who had his first onset of heart failure at age 52. His 28-year-old son and 26-year-old daughter showed similar heart anomalies as their father. Although they had no symptoms to date, depressed ventricular systolic function was noted in both of them. Pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal domain mode of inheritance. DNA sequencing found no mutation in the known disease-causing genes of ILVNC. Interestingly, two other members of the family, the proband's wife (also his first cousin) and her sister had classic echocardiographic presentation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). CONCLUSION: A single Chinese family with ILVNC associated with HCM is reported; no mutations in TAZ, DTNA, LDB3, LMNA and FKBP12 was found.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical profile associated with triple sarcomere gene mutations in a large hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cohort. BACKGROUND: In patients with HCM, double or compound sarcomere gene mutation heterozygosity might be associated with earlier disease onset and more severe outcome. The occurrence of triple mutations has not been reported. METHODS: A total of 488 unrelated index HCM patients underwent screening for myofilament gene mutations by direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing of 8 genes, including myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), regulatory and essential light chains (MYL2, MYL3), troponin-T (TNNT2), troponin-I (TNNI3), alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1), and actin (ACTC). RESULTS: Of the 488 index patients, 4 (0.8%) harbored triple mutations, as follows: MYH7-R869H, MYBPC3-E258K, and TNNI3-A86fs in a 32-year-old woman; MYH7-R723C, MYH7-E1455X, and MYBPC3-E165D in a 46-year old man; MYH7-R869H, MYBPC3-K1065fs, and MYBPC3-P371R in a 45-year old woman; and MYH7-R1079Q, MYBPC3-Q969X, and MYBPC3-R668H in a 50-year old woman. One had a history of resuscitated cardiac arrest, and 3 had significant risk factors for sudden cardiac death, prompting the insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in all, with appropriate shocks in 2 patients. Moreover, 3 of 4 patients had a severe phenotype with progression to end-stage HCM by the fourth decade, requiring cardiac transplantation (n=1) or biventricular pacing (n=2). The fourth patient, however, had clinically mild disease. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by triple sarcomere gene mutations was rare but conferred a remarkably increased risk of end-stage progression and ventricular arrhythmias, supporting an association between multiple sarcomere defects and adverse outcome. Comprehensive genetic testing might provide important insights to risk stratification and potentially indicate the need for differential surveillance strategies based on genotype.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Transgenic mice overexpressing mutated NEBL, encoding the cardiac-specific Z-disk protein nebulette, develop severe cardiac phenotypes. Since cardiomyopathies are commonly familial and because mutations in a single gene may result in variable phenotypes, we tested the hypothesis that NEBL mutations are associated with cardiomyopathy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 389 patients, including cohorts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). The 28 coding exons of the NEBL gene were sequenced. Further bioinformatic analysis was used to distinguish variants. RESULTS: In total, we identified six very rare heterozygous missense mutations in NEBL in 7 different patients (frequency 1.8%) in highly conserved codons. The mutations were not detectable in 320 Caucasian sex-matched unrelated individuals without cardiomyopathy and 192 Caucasian sex-matched blood donors without heart disease. Known cardiomyopathy genes were excluded in these patients. The mutations p.H171R and p.I652L were found in 2 HCM patients. Further, p.Q581R and p.S747L were detected in 2 DCM patients, while the mutation p.A175T was identified independently in two unrelated patients with DCM. One LVNC patient carried the mutation p.P916L. All HCM and DCM related mutations were located in the nebulin-like repeats, domains responsible for actin binding. Interestingly, the mutation associated with LVNC was located in the C-terminal serine-rich linker region. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that NEBL mutations may cause various cardiomyopathies. We herein describe the first NEBL mutations in HCM and LVNC. Our findings underline the notion that the cardiomyopathies are true allelic diseases.",

Clonal haematopoiesis (CH) is emerging as a cardiovascular risk factor potentially associated with adverse clinical events. The prevalence, phenotype and outcomes related to CH in HCM patients were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HCM and available biospecimens from the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre Cardiovascular Biobank were subjected to targeted sequencing for 35 myeloid genes associated with CH. CH prevalence, clinical characteristics, morphological phenotypes assessed by echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance and outcomes were assessed. All patients were evaluated for a 71-plex cytokines/chemokines, troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide analysis. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock, stroke, cardiac arrest, orthotopic heart transplant and death. Among the 799 patients, CH was found in 183 (22.9%) HCM patients with sarcomeric germline mutations. HCM patients with CH were more symptomatic and with a higher burden of fibrosis than those without CH. CH was associated with MACE in those HCM patients with sarcomeric germline mutations (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 6.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78-26.6; p = 0.005), with the highest risk among those that had DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 mutations (adjusted HR 5.76, 95% CI 1.51-21.94; p = 0.010). Several cytokines (IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-17F, TGFα, CCL21, CCL1, CCL8, and CCL17), and troponin I were upregulated in gene-positive HCM patients with CH. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CH in patients with HCM is associated with worse clinical outcomes. In the absence of CH, gene-positive patients with HCM have lower rates of MACE.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: In the nationwide FinHCM Study including 306 Finnish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), we have previously identified two founder mutations in the alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1-D175N) and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3-Q1061X) genes, accounting for 18% of all cases. Objective. To screen additional mutations, previously identified in eastern Finnish cohorts with HCM, in the FinHCM Study population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), TPM1, and MYBPC3 were screened. RESULTS: MYH7-R1053Q was found in 17 of 306 patients (5.6%). No carriers of MYH7-R719W or N696S were found. A novel TPM1-D175G mutation was found in a single patient. MYBPC3 mutations were found in 14 patients: IVS5-2A-C in two, IVS14-13G-A in two, K811del in six, and A851insT in four patients. Altogether, a HCM-causing mutation was identified in 32 patients, accounting for 10.5% of all cases. In addition, two MYBPC3 variants R326Q and V896M with uncertain pathogenicity were found in eight and in 10 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining the present findings with our previous results, a causative mutation was identified in 28% of the FinHCM cohort. MYH7-R1053Q was the third most common mutation, and should be screened in all new cases of HCM in Finland.",

        "Abstract Note": "Mitral valve (MV) leaflet elongation is recognized as a primary phenotypic expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that contributes to obstruction. This study investigates the correlation between MV length and genotype mutations in the two predominant genes, myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and the β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) in patients with obstructive HCM (OHCM). Among the 402 OHCM patients, there were likely pathogenic or pathogenic variations in MYH7 (n = 94) and MYBPC3 (n = 76), along with a mutation-negative group (n = 212). Compared to genotype-negative patients, genotype-positive individuals exhibited elongated MV length, thicker interventricular septum, and increased instances of late gadolinium enhancement. Notably, MYH7 mutations were associated with a more severe disease trajectory than MYBPC3 mutations. After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that MYH7 gene mutations and left ventricular volume were independently associated with MV leaflet elongation. The study indicates that mutations in MYH7 and hemodynamics factors are significant risk factors for elongated MV leaflet. Consequently, regular assessment of MV length, especially in patients with MYH7 mutation and enlarged LV volume, is crucial for timely preoperative strategic planning and improved prognosis.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess myocardial blood flow (MBF) using positron emission tomography in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) according to genetic status. BACKGROUND: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an important feature of HCM, associated with ventricular remodeling and heart failure. We recently demonstrated the increased prevalence of systolic dysfunction in patients with HCM with sarcomere myofilament gene mutations and postulated an association between genetic status and coronary microvascular dysfunction. METHODS: Maximum MBF (intravenous dipyridamole, 0.56 mg/kg; Dip-MBF) was measured using (13)N-labeled ammonia in 61 patients with HCM (age 38 ± 14 years), genotyped by automatic DNA sequencing of 8 myofilament-encoding genes (myosin-binding protein C, beta-myosin heavy chain, regulatory and essential light chains, troponin T, troponin I, troponin C, alpha-tropomyosin, and alpha-actin). In 35 patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-three mutations were identified in 42 of the 61 patients (genotype positive; 69%). Despite similar clinical profiles, genotype-positive patients with HCM showed substantially lower Dip-MBF compared with that of genotype-negative patients (1.7 ± 0.6 ml/min/g vs. 2.4 ± 1.2 ml/min/g; p < 0.02). A Dip-MBF <1.5 ml/min/g had 81% positive predictive value for genotype-positive status and implied a 3.5-fold independent increase in likelihood of carrying myofilament gene mutations (hazard ratio: 3.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 11.7; p = 0.04). At cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the prevalence of late gadolinium enhancement was greater in genotype-positive patients (22 of 23 [96%] compared with 8 of 12 [67%] genotype-negative patients; p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HCM with sarcomere myofilament mutations are characterized by more severe impairment of microvascular function and increased prevalence of myocardial fibrosis, compared with genotype-negative individuals. These findings suggest a direct link between sarcomere gene mutations and adverse remodeling of the microcirculation in HCM, accounting for the increased long-term prevalence of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure in genotype-positive patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Variants in the MYBPC3 gene are a frequent cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) but display a large phenotypic heterogeneity. Founder mutations are often believed to be more benign as they prevailed despite potential negative selection pressure. We detected a pathogenic variant in MYBPC3 (del exon 23-26) in several probands. We aimed to assess the presence of a common haplotype and to describe the cardiac characteristics, disease severity and long-term outcome of mutation carriers. METHODS: Probands with HCM caused by a pathogenic deletion of exon 23-26 of MYBPC3 were identified through genetic screening using a gene panel encompassing 59 genes associated with cardiomyopathies in a single genetic center in Belgium. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives was performed, and genotype positive relatives were further phenotyped. Clinical characteristics were collected from probands and relatives. Cardiac outcomes included death, heart transplantation, life-threatening arrhythmia, heart failure hospitalization or septal reduction therapy. Haplotype analysis, using microsatellite markers surrounding MYBPC3, was performed in all index patients to identify a common haplotype. The age of the founder variant was estimated based on the size of the shared haplotype using a linkage-disequilibrium based approach. RESULTS: We identified 24 probands with HCM harbouring the MYBPC3 exon 23-26 deletion. Probands were on average 51 ± 16 years old at time of clinical HCM diagnosis and 62 ± 10 years old at time of genetic diagnosis. A common haplotype of 1.19 Mb was identified in all 24 probands, with 19 of the probands sharing a 13.8 Mb haplotype. The founder event was estimated to have happened five generations, or 175-200 years ago, around the year 1830 in central Flanders. Through cascade screening, 59 first-degree relatives were genetically tested, of whom 37 (62.7%) were genotype positive (G+) and 22 (37.3%) genotype negative (G-). They were on average 38 ± 19 years old at time of genetic testing. Subsequent clinical assessment revealed a HCM phenotype in 19 (51.4%) G+ relatives. Probands were older (63 ± 10 vs. 42 ± 21 years; p < 0.001) and had more severe phenotypes than G+ family members, presenting with more symptoms (50% vs. 13.5%; p = 0.002), arrhythmia (41.7% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.014), more overt hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (43.5% vs. 3.0%; p < 0.001). Male G+ relatives more often had a HCM phenotype (78.6% vs. 34.8%; p = 0.010) and were more severely affected than females. At the age of 50, a penetrance of 78.6% was observed, defined as the presence of HCM in 11 of 14 G+ relatives with age ≥50 years. Overall, 20.3% of all variant carriers developed one of the predefined cardiac outcomes after a median follow-up of 5.5 years with an average age of 50 (±21) years. CONCLUSION: A Belgian founder variant, an exon 23-26 deletion in MYBPC3, was identified in 24 probands and 37 family members. The variant is characterized by a high penetrance of 78.6% at the age of 50 years but has variable phenotypic expression. Adverse outcomes were observed in 20.3% of patients during follow-up.",

        "Abstract Note": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is an uncommon heart muscle disorder characterized by impaired filling of the ventricles with reduced volume in the presence of normal or near normal wall thickness and systolic function. The disease may be associated with systemic disease but is most often idiopathic. We recognized a large family in which individuals were affected by either idiopathic RCM or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Linkage analysis to selected sarcomeric contractile protein genes identified cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) as the likely disease gene. Subsequent mutation analysis revealed a novel missense mutation, which cosegregated with the disease in the family (lod score: 4.8). To determine if idiopathic RCM is part of the clinical expression of TNNI3 mutations, genetic investigations of the gene were performed in an additional nine unrelated RCM patients with restrictive filling patterns, bi-atrial dilatation, normal systolic function, and normal wall thickness. TNNI3 mutations were identified in six of these nine RCM patients. Two of the mutations identified in young individuals were de novo mutations. All mutations appeared in conserved and functionally important domains of the gene. This article was published online in advance of the print edition.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced 59 cardiomyopathy-associated genes in 382 unrelated Finnish patients with HCM and found 24 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in six genes in 38.2% of patients. Most mutations were located in sarcomere genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, TPM1, and MYL2). Previously reported mutations by our study group (MYBPC3-Gln1061Ter, MYH7-Arg1053Gln, and TPM1-Asp175Asn) and a fourth major mutation MYH7-Val606Met accounted for 28.0% of cases. Mutations in GLA and PRKAG2 were found in three patients. Furthermore, we found 49 variants of unknown significance in 31 genes in 20.4% of cases. During a 6.7 ± 4.2 year follow-up, annual all-cause mortality in 482 index patients and their relatives with HCM was higher than that in the matched Finnish population (1.70 vs. 0.87%; P < 0.001). Sudden cardiac deaths were rare (n = 8). Systolic heart failure (hazard ratio 17.256, 95% confidence interval 3.266-91.170, P = 0.001) and maximal left ventricular wall thickness (hazard ratio 1.223, 95% confidence interval 1.098-1.363, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of HCM-related mortality and life-threatening cardiac events. The patients with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation more often than patients without a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation (12.9 vs. 3.5%, P < 0.001), but there was no difference in all-cause or HCM-related mortality between the two groups. Mortality due to HCM during 10 year follow-up among the 5.2 million population of Finland was studied from death certificates of the National Registry, showing 269 HCM-related deaths, of which 32% were sudden. CONCLUSIONS: We identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations in 38% of Finnish patients with HCM. Four major sarcomere mutations accounted for 28% of HCM cases, whereas HCM-related mutations in non-sarcomeric genes were rare. Mortality in patients with HCM exceeded that of the general population. Finally, among 5.2 million Finns, there were at least 27 HCM-related deaths annually.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Disease mechanisms regarding hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are largely unknown and disease onset varies. Sarcomere mutations might induce energy depletion for which until now there is no direct evidence at sarcomere level in human HCM. This study investigated if mutations in genes encoding myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) and myosin heavy chain (MYH7) underlie changes in the energetic cost of contraction in the development of human HCM disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Energetic cost of contraction was studied in vitro by measurements of force development and ATPase activity in cardiac muscle strips from 26 manifest HCM patients (11 MYBPC3mut, 9 MYH7mut, and 6 sarcomere mutation-negative, HCMsmn). In addition, in vivo, the ratio between external work (EW) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) to obtain myocardial external efficiency (MEE) was determined in 28 pre-hypertrophic mutation carriers (14 MYBPC3mut and 14 MYH7mut) and 14 healthy controls using [(11)C]-acetate positron emission tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Tension cost (TC), i.e. ATPase activity during force development, was higher in MYBPC3mut and MYH7mut compared with HCMsmn at saturating [Ca(2+)]. TC was also significantly higher in MYH7mut at submaximal, more physiological [Ca(2+)]. EW was significantly lower in both mutation carrier groups, while MVO2 did not differ. MEE was significantly lower in both mutation carrier groups compared with controls, showing the lowest efficiency in MYH7 mutation carriers. CONCLUSION: We provide direct evidence that sarcomere mutations perturb the energetic cost of cardiac contraction. Gene-specific severity of cardiac abnormalities may underlie differences in disease onset and suggests that early initiation of metabolic treatment may be beneficial, in particular, in MYH7 mutation carriers.",

        "Abstract Note": "We tested the hypothesis that perturbations in metavinculin may provide a pathogenic substrate for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are partially allelic disorders whereby identical genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Mutations in metavinculin, a muscle-specific isoform of vinculin, were identified previously in DCM and shown to alter in vitro organization of actin filaments. Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct DNA sequencing, mutational analysis of the metavinculin-specific exon of vinculin (VCL, exon 19) was performed in a cohort of 389 unrelated patients with clinical HCM, previously genotyped for the 8 most common HCM-associated myofilament-encoding genes. Overall, 3 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (A934V, P943A, and R975W) were detected in 4 patients. One patient with severely obstructive, mid-ventricular and apical hypertrophy harbored the previously published DCM-associated mutation, R975W. R975 is a highly conserved residue and R975W was absent in over 1400 reference alleles. Immunohistochemical analysis of the proband's myectomy specimen revealed a paucity of vinculin/metavinculin in the intercalated discs. Metavinculin mutations are pathogenic substrates for both HCM and DCM, further highlighting the allelic nature of these cardiomyopathies. Mutations in functionally distinct regions of certain cardiomyopathy-associated genes may have a dominant effect in determining a remodeling pathway of either maladaptive hypertrophy or dilation. However, this study demonstrates that the same fundamental mutation in humans can yield either cardiomyopathic phenotype, underscoring a critical role for modifier genes and/or environmental stressors in cardiac remodeling.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Mutations in MYL3, encoding the essential light chain of myosin, are rare and have been associated with sudden death. Both recessive and dominant patterns of inheritance have been suggested. We studied a large family with a 38-year-old asymptomatic HCM-affected male referred because of a murmur. The patient had HCM with left ventricular hypertrophy (max WT 21 mm), a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 36 mm Hg, and left atrial dilation (54 mm). Genotyping revealed heterozygosity for a novel missense mutation, p.V79I, in MYL3. The mutation was not found in 300 controls, and the patient had no mutations in 10 sarcomere genes. Cascade screening revealed a further nine heterozygote mutation carriers, three of whom had ECG and/or echocardiographic abnormalities but did not fulfil diagnostic criteria for HCM. The penetrance, if we consider this borderline HCM the phenotype of the p.V79I mutation, was 40%, but the mean age of the nonpenetrant mutation carriers is 15, while the mean age of the penetrant mutation carriers is 47. The mutation affects a conserved valine replacing it with a larger isoleucine residue in the region of contact between the light chain and the myosin lever arm. In conclusion, MYL3 mutations can present with low expressivity and late onset.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common genetic cardiovascular disorders. Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene are one of the most frequent genetic causes of HCM. OBJECTIVES: To screen MYBPC3 gene mutations in Chinese patients with HCM, and analyze the correlation between the genotype and the phenotype. METHODS: The 35 exons of the MYBPC3 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the 11 consecutive unrelated Chinese pedigrees. The sequences of the products were analyzed and the mutation sites were determined. The clinical data of genotype-positive families were collected, and the correlation between genotype and phenotype was analyzed. RESULTS: Two mutations of the MYBPC3 gene were confirmed among 11 pedigrees. A frameshift mutation (Pro459fs) was identified in exon 17 in family H8, and a splice mutation (IVS5+5G−>C) was identified in intron 5 in family H3. These two mutations were first identified in Chinese patients with familial HCM and were absent in 110 chromosomes of healthy controls. Seven known polymorphisms were found in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with what was reported abroad, the MYBPC3 gene is a common pathogenic gene responsible for HCM in Chinese patients, and the phenotypes of these two mutations in their respective families may have their own clinical characteristics.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: TTN-encoded titin, CSRP3-encoded muscle LIM protein, and TCAP-encoded telethonin are Z-disc proteins essential for the structural organization of the cardiac sarcomere and the cardiomyocyte's stretch sensor. All three genes have been established as cardiomyopathy-associated genes for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we sought to characterize the frequency, spectrum, and phenotype associated with HCM-associated mutations in these three genes in a large cohort of unrelated patients evaluated at a single tertiary outpatient center. METHODS: DNA was obtained from 389 patients with HCM (215 male, left ventricular wall thickness of 21.6+/-6 mm) and analyzed for mutations involving all translated exons of CSRP3 and TCAP and targeted HCM-associated exons (2, 3, 4, and 14) of TTN using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and direct DNA sequencing. Clinical data were extracted from patient records and maintained independent of the genotype. RESULTS: Overall, 16 patients (4.1%) harbored a Z-disc mutation: 12 had a MLP mutation and 4 patients a TCAP mutation. No TTN mutations were detected. Seven patients were also found to have a concomitant myofilament mutation. Seven patients with a MLP-mutation were found to harbor the DCM-associated, functionally characterized W4R mutation. W4R-MLP was also noted in a single white control subject. Patients with MLP/TCAP-associated HCM clinically mimicked myofilament-HCM. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 4.1% of unrelated patients had HCM-associated MLP or TCAP mutations. MLP/TCAP-HCM phenotypically mirrors myofilament-HCM and is more severe than the subset of patients who still remain without a disease-causing mutation. The precise role of W4R-MLP in the pathogenesis of either DCM or HCM warrants further investigation.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common hereditary diseases, and it is associated with fatal complications. The clinical heterogeneity of HCM requires risk prediction models to identify patients at a high risk of adverse events. Most HCM cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. However, HCM is associated with rare genetic variants with limited data about its clinical course and prognosis, and existing risk prediction models are not validated for such patients' cohorts. TRIM63 is one of the rare genes recently described as a cause of HCM with autosomal-recessive inheritance. Herein, we present two cases of HCM associated with TRIM63-compound heterozygous variants in young male sportsmen. They demonstrated progressively marked hypertrophy, advanced diastolic dysfunction, a significant degree of fibrosis detected by magnetic resonance imaging, and clear indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. One of the cases includes the first description of TRIM63-HCM with extreme hypertrophy. The presented cases are discussed in light of molecular consequences that might underlie cardiac and muscle phenotype in patients with mutations of TRIM63, the master regulator of striated muscle mass.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Risk factors for diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are poorly understood. We investigated the association of variants in hypoxia-response genes with phenotype severity in pediatric HCM. METHODS: A total of 80 unrelated patients <21 y and 14 related members from eight families with HCM were genotyped for six variants associated with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) downregulation, or hypoxia-inducible factor A (HIF1A) upregulation. Associations between risk genotypes and left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV dysfunction, and freedom from myectomy were assessed. Tissue expression was measured in myocardial samples from 17 patients with HCM and 20 patients without HCM. RESULTS: Age at enrollment was 9 ± 5 y (follow-up, 3.1 ± 3.6 y). Risk allele frequency was 67% VEGFA and 92% HIF1A. Risk genotypes were associated with younger age at diagnosis (P < 0.001), septal hypertrophy (P < 0.01), prolonged E-wave deceleration time (EWDT) (P < 0.0001) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) (P < 0.0001), and lower freedom from myectomy (P < 0.05). These associations were seen in sporadic and familial HCM independent of the disease-causing mutation. Risk genotypes were associated with higher myocardial HIF1A and transforming growth factor B1 (TGFB1) expression and increased endothelial-fibroblast transformation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIF1A-upregulation and/or VEGFA-downregulation genotypes were associated with more severe septal hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and may provide genetic markers to improve risk prediction in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disease partly explained by the effects of individual gene variants on sarcomeric protein biomechanics. At the cellular level, HCM mutations most commonly enhance force production, leading to higher energy demands. Despite significant advances in elucidating sarcomeric structure-function relationships, there is still much to be learned about the mechanisms that link altered cardiac energetics to HCM phenotypes. In this work, we test the hypothesis that changes in cardiac energetics represent a common pathophysiologic pathway in HCM. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive multiomics profile of the molecular (transcripts, metabolites, and complex lipids), ultrastructural, and functional components of HCM energetics using myocardial samples from 27 HCM patients and 13 normal controls (donor hearts). RESULTS: Integrated omics analysis revealed alterations in a wide array of biochemical pathways with major dysregulation in fatty acid metabolism, reduction of acylcarnitines, and accumulation of free fatty acids. HCM hearts showed evidence of global energetic decompensation manifested by a decrease in high energy phosphate metabolites (ATP, ADP, and phosphocreatine) and a reduction in mitochondrial genes involved in creatine kinase and ATP synthesis. Accompanying these metabolic derangements, electron microscopy showed an increased fraction of severely damaged mitochondria with reduced cristae density, coinciding with reduced citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial oxidative respiration. These mitochondrial abnormalities were associated with elevated reactive oxygen species and reduced antioxidant defenses. However, despite significant mitochondrial injury, HCM hearts failed to upregulate mitophagic clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that perturbed metabolic signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction are common pathogenic mechanisms in patients with HCM. These results highlight potential new drug targets for attenuation of the clinical disease through improving metabolic function and reducing mitochondrial injury.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of a considerable fraction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases remains unknown. Whether the gene encoding RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) is implicated in HCM and the correlation of clinical characteristics of RBM20 heterozygotes with HCM remain unresolved. We aimed to investigate the association between RBM20 variants and HCM. METHODS: We compared rare variants in the RBM20 gene by exome sequencing in 793 patients with HCM and 414 healthy controls. Based on a case-control approach, we used optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O) to explore whether RBM20 is associated with HCM. The genetic distribution of RBM20 rare variants was then compared between HCM heterozygotes and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) heterozygotes. Clinical features and prognosis of RBM20 heterozygotes were compared with nonheterozygotes. RESULTS: Gene-based association analysis implicated RBM20 as a susceptibility gene for developing HCM. Patients with RBM20 variants displayed a higher prevalence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) (6.7% vs 0.9%, P = 0.001), increased sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk factor counts and impaired left ventricle systolic function. Further survival analysis revealed that RBM20 heterozygotes had higher incidences of resuscitated cardiac arrest, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and malignant arrhythmias. Mendelian randomization suggested that RBM20 expression in the left ventricle was causally associated with HCM and DCM with opposite effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified RBM20 as a potential causal gene of HCM. RBM20 variants are associated with increased risk for SCA in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with gene mutations that encode sarcomeric proteins. However, the relationship between genotype and histopathologic findings is unclear. We report on two autopsy cases with advanced HCM associated with deletion of lysine 183 mutation in the cardiac troponin I gene. One case, a 74-year-old female exhibited dilated cardiomyopathy-like features. Transmural scarring was diffuse and circumferential, involving the whole left ventricle, especially the ventricular septum which was replaced with extensive fibrosis and showed marked wall thinning. The other case, a 92-year-old male revealed typical HCM findings. Patchy scars which corresponded to replacement fibrosis were found extending from the septum to the anterior wall. These two autopsy cases indicate the clinical heterogeneity of HCM even within the same disease-causing mutation and suggest that the degree and extent of fibrosis determine differences in the clinical manifestations of HCM. This is the first autopsy report that demonstrates identical sarcomeric gene mutations causing different clinical manifestations and histologic findings. The findings suggest that additional genetic or environmental factors influence the phenotypic expressions and clinical courses of HCM caused by genetic mutation of sarcomeric proteins.",

        "Abstract Note": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a major concern for global health, whose mechanistic understanding is complicated by a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Specifically, heart failure (HF), encompassing dilated cardiomyopathy (DC), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), is a topic of substantial interest in basic and clinical research. Here, we used a Partial Correlation Coefficient-based algorithm (PCC) within the context of a meta-analysis framework to construct a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) that identifies key regulators whose activity is perturbed in Heart Failure. By integrating data from multiple independent studies, our approach unveiled crucial regulatory associations between transcription factors (TFs) and structural genes, emphasizing their pivotal roles in regulating metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress response, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and coagulation. In addition to known associations, our analysis also identified novel regulators, including the identification of TFs FPM315 and OVOL2, which are implicated in dilated cardiomyopathies, and TEAD1 and TEAD2 in both dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathies. Moreover, we uncovered alterations in adipogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and discovered a role for IL2 STAT5 signaling in heart failure. Our findings underscore the importance of TF activity in the initiation and progression of cardiac disease, highlighting their potential as pharmacological targets.",

METHODS: Forty-five unrelated probands with HCM were screened by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of 47 core and emerging genes connected with HCM.

A definite genetic etiology was found in 6 probands (13.3%), while inconclusive results due to either known or novel variants were established in 31 cases (68.9%). All disease-causing variants were detected in sarcomeric genes (MYBPC3 and MYH7 with two cases each, and one case in TNNI3 and TPM1 respectively). Multiple variants were detected in 27 subjects (60%), but no proband carried more than one causal variant. Of note, almost half of the rare variants were novel. CONCLUSIONS: Herein we reported for the first time the rare variants identified in core and putative genes associated with HCM in a cohort of Romanian unrelated adult patients. The clinical significance of most detected variants is yet to be established, additional studies based on segregation analysis being required for definite classification.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death. Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene represent the cause of HCM in ~35% of patients with HCM. However, genetic testing in clinic setting has been limited due to the cost and relatively time-consuming by Sanger sequencing. Here, we developed a HCM Molecular Diagnostic Kit enabling ultra-low-cost targeted gene resequencing in a large cohort and investigated the mutation spectrum of MYBPC3. In a cohort of 114 patients with HCM, a total of 20 different mutations (8 novel and 12 known mutations) of MYBPC3 were identified from 25 patients (21.9%). We demonstrated that the power of targeted resequencing in a cohort of HCM patients, and found that MYBPC3 is a common HCM-causing gene in Chinese patients. Phenotype-genotype analyses showed that the patients with double mutations (n = 2) or premature termination codon mutations (n = 12) showed more severe manifestations, compared with patients with missense mutations (n = 11). Particularly, we identified a recurrent truncation mutation (p.Y842X) in four unrelated cases (4/25, 16%), who showed severe phenotypes, and suggest that the p.Y842X is a frequent mutation in Chinese HCM patients with severe phenotypes.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), frequently caused by sarcomeric gene mutations, is characterized by cellular dysfunction and asymmetric left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. We studied whether cellular dysfunction is due to an intrinsic sarcomere defect or cardiomyocyte remodelling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac samples from 43 sarcomere mutation-positive patients (HCMmut: mutations in thick (MYBPC3, MYH7) and thin (TPM1, TNNI3, TNNT2) myofilament genes) were compared with 14 sarcomere mutation-negative patients (HCMsmn), eight patients with secondary LV hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis (LVHao) and 13 donors. Force measurements in single membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes revealed significantly lower maximal force generating capacity (Fmax) in HCMmut (21 ± 1 kN/m²) and HCMsmn (26 ± 3 kN/m²) compared with donor (36 ± 2 kN/m²). Cardiomyocyte remodelling was more severe in HCMmut compared with HCMsmn based on significantly lower myofibril density (49 ± 2 vs. 63 ± 5%) and significantly higher cardiomyocyte area (915 ± 15 vs. 612 ± 11 μm²). Low Fmax in MYBPC3mut, TNNI3mut, HCMsmn, and LVHao was normalized to donor values after correction for myofibril density. However, Fmax was significantly lower in MYH7mut, TPM1mut, and TNNT2mut even after correction for myofibril density. In accordance, measurements in single myofibrils showed very low Fmax in MYH7mut, TPM1mut, and TNNT2mut compared with donor (respectively, 73 ± 3, 70 ± 7, 83 ± 6, and 113 ± 5 kN/m²). In addition, force was lower in MYH7mut cardiomyocytes compared with MYBPC3mut, HCMsmn, and donor at submaximal [Ca²⁺]. CONCLUSION: Low cardiomyocyte Fmax in HCM patients is largely explained by hypertrophy and reduced myofibril density. MYH7 mutations reduce force generating capacity of sarcomeres at maximal and submaximal [Ca²⁺]. These hypocontractile sarcomeres may represent the primary abnormality in patients with MYH7 mutations.",

        "Abstract Note": "Founder variants in sarcomere protein genes account for a significant proportion of disease-causing variants in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, information on founder variants in non-sarcomeric protein genes, such as FHOD3, which have only recently been associated with HCM, remains scarce. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of exome sequencing data of 134 probands with HCM for recurrent pathogenic variants. We discovered a novel likely pathogenic variant c.1646+2T>C in FHOD3 in heterozygous state in eight probands with HCM and confirmed its presence in seven additional relatives. Individuals with this variant had a wide range of ages at onset of the disease (4-63 years). No adverse cardiac events were observed. Haplotype analysis revealed that the individuals with this variant shared a genomic region of approximately 5 Mbp surrounding the variant, confirming the founder effect of the variant. FHOD3 c.1646+2T>C is estimated to have arisen 58 generations ago (95% CI: 45-81) in a common ancestor living on the Balkans. A founder FHOD3 c.1646+2T>C variant is the second most common genetic variant in our cohort of patients with HCM, occurring in 16% of probands with a known genetic cause of HCM, which represents a substantially higher proportion than the currently estimated 0.5-2% for causal FHOD3 variants. Our study broadens the understanding of the genetic causes of HCM and may improve the diagnosis of this condition, particularly in patients from the Balkans.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in different structural genes and induces pathological hypertrophy with sudden cardiac death as a possible consequence. HCM can be separated into hypertrophic non-obstructive and obstructive cardiomyopathy (HNCM/HOCM) with different clinical treatment approaches. We here distinguished between HNCM, HOCM, cardiac amyloidosis and aortic stenosis by using microRNA profiling and investigated potential interactions between circulating miRNA levels and the most common mutations in MYH7and MYBPC3 genes. METHODS: Our study included 4 different groups: 23 patients with HNCM, 28 patients with HOCM, 47 patients with aortic stenosis and 22 healthy controls. Based on previous findings, 8 different cardiovascular known microRNAs (miR-1, miR-21, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c, miR-133a, miR-155 and miR-499) were studied in serum of all patients and compared with clinically available patient data. RESULTS: We found miR-29a levels to be increased in patients with HOCM and correlating markers of cardiac hypertrophy. This was not the case in HNCM patients. In contrast, we identified miR-29c to be upregulated in aortic stenosis but not the other patient groups. ROC curve analysis of miR-29a/c distinguished between HOCM patients and aortic stenosis patients. MiR-29a and miR-155 levels discriminated HNCM patients from patients with senile cardiac amyloidosis. MiR-29a increased mainly in HOCM patients with a mutation in MYH7, whereas miR-155 was decreased in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with a mutation in MYBPC3. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that miR-29a and miR-29c show a specific signature to distinguish between aortic stenosis, hypertrophic non-obstructive and obstructive cardiomyopathies and thus could be developed into clinically useful biomarkers.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable heart disease. The genetic anticipation of HCM and its associated etiology, sudden cardiac death (SCD), remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying the genetic anticipation of HCM and associated SCD.An HCM family including 5 generations and 74 members was studied. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed to diagnose HCM. The age of onset of HCM was defined as the age at first diagnosis according to hospital records. The information on SCD was confirmed by verification by ≥2 family members and a review of hospital records. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 4 HCM subjects and 1 healthy control in the family. The identified mutations were screened in all available family members and 216 unrelated healthy controls by Sanger sequencing.The median ages of onset of HCM were 63.5, 38.5, and 18.0 years in members of the second, third, and fourth generations of the family, respectively, and the differences between the generations were significant (P < 0.001). The age at SCD also decreased with each subsequent generation (P < 0.05). In particular, among the third-generation family members, SCD occurred between 30 and 40 years of age at approximately 8 AM, whereas among the fourth-generation family members, all 5 males who experienced SCD were 16 years of age and died at approximately 8 AM. The sarcomere gene mutations MYH7-A719H and MYOZ2-L169G were detected in the HCM individuals in this pedigree. Increases in the number of mutations and the frequency of multiple gene mutations were observed in the younger generations. Moreover, a structural variant was present in the HCM phenotype-positive subjects but was absent in the HCM phenotype-negative subjects.HCM may exhibit genetic anticipation, with a decreased age of onset and increased severity in successive generations. Multiple gene mutations may contribute to genetic anticipation in HCM and thus may be of prognostic value.",

        "Abstract Note": "The objective of this work was to identify genetic variants in Mexican patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). According to world literature, the genes mainly involved are MHY7 and MYBPC3, although variants have been found in more than 50 genes related to heart disease and sudden death, and to our knowledge there are no studies in the Mexican population. These variants are reported and classified in the ClinVar (PubMed) database and only some of them are recognized in the Online Mendelian Information in Men (OMIM). The present study included 37 patients, with 14 sporadic cases and 6 familial cases, with a total of 21 index cases. Next-generation sequencing was performed on a predesigned panel of 168 genes associated with heart disease and sudden death. The sequencing analysis revealed twelve (57%) pathogenic or probably pathogenic variants, 9 of them were familial cases, managing to identify pathogenic variants in relatives without symptoms of the disease. At the molecular level, nine of the 12 variants (75%) were single nucleotide changes, 2 (17%) deletions, and 1 (8%) splice site alteration. The genes involved were MYH7 (25%), MYBPC3 (25%) and ACADVL, KCNE1, TNNI3, TPM1, SLC22A5, TNNT2 (8%). In conclusion; we found five variants that were not previously reported in public databases. It is important to follow up on the reclassification of variants, especially those of uncertain significance in patients with symptoms of the condition. All patients included in the study and their relatives received family genetic counseling.",

Endomyocardial tissue was processed for histology, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction for the most common cardiotropic viruses. Controls were surgical samples from 50 patients with mitral stenosis. All 119 patients showed histological findings suggestive of HCM. In addition, CD45RO+ lymphocytes (> or =14/mm(2)) with focal necrosis of the adjacent severely hypertrophied and often disorganized myocytes, consistent with an overlapping active myocarditis, were observed in 28 of 42 unstable and none of 77 stable HCM patients. A viral genome was detected in 14 of 28 patients with myocarditis and in none of HCM patients without and in none of controls. No correlation between sarcomeric protein gene mutations and HCM clinical profile was observed. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis, often viral, represents a common cause of acute clinical deterioration in HCM.

The objective of the present study was to examine the association of the T704C polymorphism of exon 2 of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with HCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. Subjects and methods. One-hundred and fifty HCM (90 sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [SHCM] and 60 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [FHCM]) patients and 165 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls without known hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were included in the study. DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes and the region of interest in the AGT gene bearing a missense mutation methionine to threonine substitution at codon 235 (M235T) of exon 2, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were subjected to restriction digestion with the enzyme SfaNI. RESULTS: Significant differences were detected in genotypic distribution (p = 0.04) as well as the allelic frequency (p = 0.003) between the SHCM patients and controls. The polymorphism did not show any association with FHCM. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the T allele of the AGT gene is significantly associated with SHCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. However, we did not find significant association of this polymorphism with FHCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that function as regulators of gene expression and thereby contribute to the complex disease phenotypes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can cause sudden cardiac death and eventually develop into heart failure. However, they have different clinical and pathophysiological phenotype and the expressional spectrum of miRNAs in left ventricles of HCM and DCM has never been compared before. METHODS: This study selected 30 human left ventricular heart samples belonged to three diagnostic groups (Control, HCM, DCM). Each group has ten samples. Based on previous findings, the expression of 13 different microRNAs involving heart failure and hypertrophy (miR-1-3p, miR-10b, miR-21, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-29a, miR-133a-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-155, miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-214, miR-497) was measured. 17 HCM patients were included as second group to validate the associations. RESULTS: We found miR-155, miR-10b and miR-23a were highly expressed in both HCM and DCM compared with control. MiR-214 was downregulated and miR-21 was upregulated in DCM but not in HCM. We also identified miR-1-3p and miR-27a expressed significantly different between HCM and DCM and both miRNAs downregulated in HCM. And only miR-1-3p correlated with left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that reflected the cardiac function in HCM. A second HCM group also confirmed this correlation. We then predicted Chloride voltage-gated channel 3 (Clcn3) as a direct target gene of miR-1-3p using bioinformatics tools and confirmed it by Luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that different cardiomyopathies had unique miRNA expression pattern. And the expression levels of miR-1-3p and miR-27a had disease-specificity and sensitivity in HCM, whereas only miR-1-3p was significantly associated with left ventricular function in HCM identifying it as a potential target to improve the cardiac function in end-stage HCM. We also provide Clcn3 as a direct target of miR-1-3p which sheds light on the mechanism of HCM.",

METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Library databases from inception through 2 March 2020. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were prespecified for individual sarcomere genes, presence/absence of pathogenic variants, paediatric and adult cohorts, family history, inclusion of probands, and variant classification method. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. RESULTS: A total of 132 articles met inclusion criteria. The detection rate based on pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants was significantly higher in paediatric cohorts compared with adults (56% vs 42%; p=0.01) and in adults with a family history compared with sporadic cases (59% vs 33%; p=0.005). When studies applied current, improved, variant interpretation standards, the adult detection rate significantly decreased from 42% to 33% (p=0.0001) because less variants met criteria to be considered pathogenic. The mean difference in age-of-onset in adults was significantly earlier for genotype-positive versus genotype-negative cohorts (8.3 years; p<0.0001), MYH7 versus MYBPC3 cohorts (8.2 years; p<0.0001) and individuals with multiple versus single variants (7.0 years; p<0.0002). Overall, disease penetrance in adult cohorts was 62%, but differed significantly depending on if probands were included or excluded (73% vs 55%; p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to collectively quantify historical understandings of detection rate, genotype-phenotype associations and disease penetrance for HCM, while providing the answers to important routine clinical questions and highlighting key areas for future study.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Recent exome sequencing studies identified filamin C (FLNC) as a candidate gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our aim was to determine the rate of FLNC candidate variants in a large cohort of HCM patients who were also sequenced for the main sarcomere genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 448 HCM patients were next generation-sequenced (semiconductor chip technology) for the MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, ACTC1, TNNC1, MYL2, MYL3, TPM1, and FLNC genes. We also sequenced 450 healthy controls from the same population. Based on the reported population frequencies, bioinformatic criteria, and familial segregation, we identified 20 FLNC candidate variants (13 new; 1 nonsense; and 19 missense) in 22 patients. Compared with the patients, only 1 of the control's missense variants was nonreported (P=0.007; Fisher exact probability test). Based on the familial segregation and the reported functional studies, 6 of the candidate variants (in 7 patients) were finally classified as likely pathogenic, 10 as variants of uncertain significance, and 4 as likely benign. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a compelling evidence of the involvement of FLNC in the development of HCM. Most of the FLNC variants were associated with mild forms of HCM and a reduced penetrance, with few affected in the families to confirm the segregation. Our work, together with others who found FLNC variants among patients with dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathies, pointed to this gene as an important cause of structural cardiomyopathies.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Although studies have suggested that \"late-onset\" hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be caused by sarcomeric protein gene mutations, the cause of HCM in the majority of patients is unknown. This study determined the prevalence of a potentially treatable cause of hypertrophy, Anderson-Fabry disease, in a HCM referral population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal) was measured in 79 men with HCM who were diagnosed at > or =40 years of age (52.9+/-7.7 years; range, 40-71 years) and in 74 men who were diagnosed at <40 years (25.9+/-9.2 years; range, 8-39 years). Five patients (6.3%) with late-onset disease and 1 patient (1.4%) diagnosed at <40 years had low alpha-Gal activity. Of these 6 patients, 3 had angina, 4 were in New York Heart Association class 2, 5 had palpitations, and 2 had a history of syncope. Hypertrophy was concentric in 5 patients and asymmetric in 1 patient. One patient had left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All patients with low alpha-Gal activity had alpha-Gal gene mutations. CONCLUSION: Anderson-Fabry disease should be considered in all cases of unexplained hypertrophy. Its recognition is important given the advent of specific replacement enzyme therapy.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the gene that encode cardiac troponin T (cTnT) account for approximately 15% of cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). These mutations are associated with a particularly severe form of HCM characterized by a high incidence of sudden death and a poor overall prognosis, despite subclinical or mild left ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated a family with HCM and multiple occurrences of sudden death in children. DNA samples were isolated from peripheral blood or paraffin-embedded tissue, and all protein-encoding exons of the cTnT gene were sequenced. A mutation was identified in exon 11 and is predicted to substitute a phenylalanine-for-serine mutation at residue 179 (Ser(179)Phe) in cTnT. Both parents and 3 of 4 surviving and clinically unaffected children were heterozygous for this mutation; another clinically unaffected child did not carry the mutation. Genetic analysis of DNA from a child who died suddenly at age 17 years demonstrated he was homozygous for this mutation. A review of his echocardiogram revealed profound left and right ventricular hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: An homozygous Ser(179)Phe mutation in cTnT causes a severe form of HCM characterized by striking morphological abnormalities and juvenile lethality. In contrast, the natural history of the heterozygous mutation is benign. These studies emphasize the relevance of genetic diagnosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and provide a new perspective on the clinical consequences of troponin T mutations.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is familial in approximately 20-35% of cases of idiopathic DCM. Several mutations in the different sarcomere protein genes have been reported to cause DCM. AIMS: We wanted to investigate the role of sarcomere protein gene variants in Finnish DCM patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened all coding exons of five sarcomere protein genes (beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-tropomyosin, troponin C, troponin I and troponin T) in a well-characterized population of 52 DCM patients in Eastern Finland by the PCR-SSCP and sequencing method. Two novel mutations, Arg1053Gln and Arg1500Trp, in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene in two index patients were detected. The proband with the Arg1053Gln mutation had a dilated left ventricle and impaired systolic function, but other family members carrying this mutation presented with septal hypertrophy. It thus seems that the Arg1053Gln mutation is primarily a HCM mutation, which can also lead to DCM. The other mutation, Arg1500Trp, was associated with a typical DCM phenotype. The Arg1500Trp mutation carrier had only one family member alive, but she did not carry the mutation and, therefore, cosegregation of the mutation and the disease in this family could not be reliably verified. No disease-causing mutations were found in the other sarcomere protein genes. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene were detected in patients with DCM. Overall, mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene seem to be relatively uncommon in Finnish DCM patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine prevalence and predictive accuracy of clinical markers (red flags, RF), known to be associated with specific systemic disease in a consecutive cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: We studied 129 consecutive patients (23.7 ± 20.9 years, range 0-74 years; male/female 68%/32%). Pre-specified RF were categorized into five domains: family history; signs/symptoms; electrocardiography; imaging; and laboratory. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and predictive accuracy of RF were analyzed in the genotyped population. RESULTS: In the overall cohort of 129 patients, 169 RF were identified in 62 patients (48%). Prevalence of RF was higher in infants (78%) and in adults >55 years old (58%). Following targeted genetic and clinical evaluation, 94 patients (74%) had a definite diagnosis (sarcomeric HCM or specific causes of HCM). We observed 14 RF in 13 patients (21%) with sarcomeric gene disease, 129 RF in 34 patients (97%) with other specific causes of HCM, and 26 RF in 15 patients (45%) with idiopathic HCM (p < 0.0001). Non-sarcomeric causes of HCM were the most prevalent in ages <1yo and > 55yo. Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and PA of RF were 97%, 70%, 55%, 98% and 77%, respectively. Single and clinical combination of RF (clusters) had an high specificity, NPV and predictive accuracy for the specific etiologies (syndromes/metabolic/infiltrative disorders associated with HCM). CONCLUSIONS: An extensive diagnostic work up, focused on analysis of specific diagnostic RF in patients with unexplained LVH facilitates a clinical diagnosis in 74% of patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: Sarcomeric gene mutation carriers without overt left ventricular hypertrophy (G+/LVH-) can harbour subclinical changes in cardiovascular structure and function that precede the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We sought to investigate if circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular stress and collagen metabolism among G+/LVH- individuals, measured at rest and following exercise provocation, yield further insights into the underlying biology of HCM. METHODS: We studied 76 individuals with overt HCM, 50 G+/LVH- individuals and 41 genotype-negative related controls enrolled in a cross-sectional, multicentre observational study (HCMNet). Biomarkers of cardiac stress (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP; high-sensitivity troponin I, hsTnI; soluble ST2) and fibrosis (carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I; C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; galectin-3; periostin) were measured. RESULTS: Individuals with overt HCM had elevated NT-proBNP and hsTnI compared with G+/LVH- subjects and controls at rest, along with an exaggerated increase in NT-proBNP and hsTnI in response to exercise. We found no detectable differences in resting or exercise-provoked biomarker profiles of cardiovascular stress and fibrosis among G+/LVH- individuals compared with healthy controls despite subtle echocardiographic differences in cardiac structure and function. CONCLUSION: Dynamic exercise testing exaggerated resting differences in natriuretic peptides and troponin elevations among individuals with overt HCM. In contrast, we found no differences in biomarker profiles of cardiovascular stress and fibrosis among G+/LVH- individuals compared with controls even after maximal exercise provocation. Our findings highlight the need for continued investigation into early phenotypes of sarcomeric gene mutations and the evolution of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: We studied the clinical and genetic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by mutations in the myosin-binding protein C gene (MYBPC3) in 110 consecutive, unrelated patients and family members of European descent. BACKGROUND: Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene represent the cause of HCM in approximately 15% of familial cases. MYBPC3 mutations were reported to include mainly nonsense versus missense mutations and to be characterized by a delayed onset and benign clinical course of the disease in Japanese and French families. We investigated the features that characterize MYBPC3 variants in a large, unrelated cohort of consecutive patients. METHODS: The MYBPC3 gene was screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing. The clinical phenotypes were analyzed using rest and 24-h electrocardiography, electrophysiology, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography and angiography. RESULTS: We identified 13 mutations in the MYBPC3 gene: one nonsense, four missense and three splicing mutations and five small deletions and insertions. Of these, 11 were novel, and two were probably founder mutations. Patients with MYBPC3 mutations presented a broad range of phenotypes. In general, the 16 carriers of protein truncations had a tendency toward earlier disease manifestations (33 +/- 13 vs. 48 +/- 9 years; p = 0.06) and more frequently needed invasive procedures (septal ablation or cardioverter-defibrillator implantation) compared with the 9 carriers of missense mutations or in-frame deletions (12/16 vs. 1/9 patients; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple mutations, which include missense, nonsense and splicing mutations, as well as small deletions and insertions, occur in the MYBPC3 gene. Protein truncation mutations seem to cause a more severe disease phenotype than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.",

        "Abstract Note": "The role of genetic testing over the clinical and functional variables, including data from the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) risk stratification remains unclear. A retrospective genotype-phenotype correlation was performed to analyze possible differences between patients with and without likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) variants. A total of 371 HCM patients were screened at least for the main sarcomeric genes MYBPC3 (myosin binding protein C), MYH7 (β-myosin heavy chain), TNNI3 (cardiac troponin I) and TNNT2 (cardiac troponin T): 203 patients had at least an LP/P variant, 23 patients had a unique variant of uncertain significance (VUS) and 145 did not show any LP/P variant or VUS. During a median 5.4 years follow-up, 51 and 14 patients developed heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) or SCD-equivalents events, respectively. The LP/P variant was associated with a more aggressive HCM phenotype. However, left atrial diameter (LAd), circulatory power (peak oxygen uptake*peak systolic blood pressure, CP%) and ventilatory efficiency (C-index = 0.839) were the only independent predictors of HF whereas only LAd and CP% were predictors of the SCD end-point (C-index = 0.738). The present study reaffirms the pivotal role of the clinical variables and, particularly of those CPET-derived, in the HCM risk stratification.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Whether morphological abnormalities of the mitral valve represent part of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) disease process is unresolved. Therefore, we applied cardiovascular magnetic resonance to characterize mitral valve morphology in a large HCM cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cine cardiac magnetic resonance images were obtained in 172 HCM patients (age, 42±18 years; 62% men) and 172 control subjects. In addition, 15 HCM gene-positive/phenotype-negative relatives were studied. Anterior mitral leaflet (AML) and posterior mitral leaflet lengths were greater in HCM patients than in control subjects (26±5 versus 19±5 mm, P<0.001; and 14±4 versus 10±3 mm, P<0.001, respectively), including 59 patients (34%) in whom AML length alone, posterior mitral leaflet length alone, or both were particularly substantial (>2 SDs above controls). Leaflet length was increased compared with controls in virtually all HCM age groups, including young patients 15 to 20 years of age (AML, 26±5 versus 21±4 mm; P=0.0002) and those ≥60 years of age (AML, 26±4 versus 19±2 mm; P<0.001). No relation was evident between mitral leaflet length and LV thickness or mass index (P=0.09 and P=0.16, respectively). A ratio of AML length to LV outflow tract diameter of >2.0 was associated with subaortic obstruction (P=0.001). In addition, AML length in 15 genotype-positive relatives without LV hypertrophy exceeded that of matched control subjects (21±3 versus 18±3 mm; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, mitral valve leaflets are elongated independently of other disease variables, likely constituting a primary phenotypic expression of this heterogeneous disease, and are an important morphological abnormality responsible for LV outflow obstruction in combination with small outflow tract dimension. These findings suggest a novel role for cardiac magnetic resonance in the assessment of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "The molecular mechanisms that drive the development of cardiac hypertrophy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remain elusive. Accumulated evidence suggests that microRNAs are essential regulators of cardiac remodelling. We have been suggested that microRNAs could play a role in the process of HCM. To uncover which microRNAs were changed in their expression, microRNA microarrays were performed on heart tissue from HCM patients (n = 7) and from healthy donors (n = 5). Among the 13 microRNAs that were differentially expressed in HCM, miR-451 was the most down-regulated. Ectopic overexpression of miR-451 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) decreased the cell size, whereas knockdown of endogenous miR-451 increased the cell surface area. Luciferase reporter assay analyses demonstrated that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) was a direct target of miR-451. Overexpression of miR-451 in both HeLa cells and NRCM suppressed the expression of TSC1. Furthermore, TSC1 was significantly up-regulated in HCM myocardia, which correlated with the decreased levels of miR-451. As TSC1 is a known positive regulator of autophagy, we examined the role of miR-451 in the regulation of autophagy. Overexpression of miR-451 in vitro inhibited the formation of the autophagosome. Conversely, miR-451 knockdown accelerated autophagosome formation. Consistently, an increased number of autophagosomes was observed in HCM myocardia, accompanied by up-regulated autophagy markers, and the lipidated form of LC3 and Beclin-1. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-451 regulates cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac autophagy by targeting TSC1. The down-regulation of miR-451 may contribute to the development of HCM and may be a potential therapeutic target for this disease.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Anterior mitral valve leaflet (AMVL) elongation is detectable in overt and subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We sought to investigate the dynamic motion of the aorto-mitral apparatus to understand the behaviour of the AMVL and the mechanisms of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) predisposition in HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5 Tesla scanner was performed on 36 HCM sarcomere gene mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (G+LVH-), 31 HCM patients with preserved ejection fraction carrying a pathogenic sarcomere gene mutation (G+LVH+), and 53 age-, sex-, and body surface area-matched healthy volunteers. Dynamic excursion of the aorto-mitral apparatus was assessed semi-automatically on breath-held three-chamber cine steady-state free precession images. Four pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs) were tracked: ROIPMVL: hinge point of the posterior mitral valve leaflet; ROITRIG: intertrigonal mitral annulus; ROIAMVL: AMVL tip; and ROIAAO: anterior aortic annulus. Compared with controls, normalized two-dimensional displacement-vs.-time plots in G+LVH- revealed subtle but significant systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the AMVL (P < 0.0001) and reduced longitudinal excursion of ROIAAO (P = 0.014) and ROIPMVL (P = 0.048). In overt and subclinical HCM, excursion of the ROITRIG/AMVL/PMVL was positively associated with the burden of left ventricular fibrosis (P < 0.028). As expected, SAM was observed in G+LVH+ together with reduced longitudinal excursion of ROITRIG (P = 0.049) and ROIAAO (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Dyskinesia of the aorto-mitral apparatus, including SAM of the elongated AMVL, is detectable in subclinical HCM before the development of LVH or left atrial enlargement. These data have the potential to improve our understanding of early phenotype development and LVOTO predisposition in HCM.",

HYPOTHESIS: To prospectively investigate whether different gene mutations confer distinct prognosis. METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 70 HCM patients and 46 genetically affected family members without HCM-phenotype with direct DNA sequencing of MYH7 and MYBPC3, clinical assessments, and 5.8 +/- 1.8 years follow-up. RESULTS: After follow-up, more surgical intervention (8/52 versus 0/18, p < 0.001), higher sudden death risk (7/52 versus 0/18, p < 0.001) and shorter life span were found in patients with MYH7 mutations than in patients with MYBPC3 mutations (45.1 +/- 14.0 versus 73.5 +/- 7.5 years, p = 0.03). Seven of the 27 mutation carriers of MYH7 had clinical presentations of HCM, but no carriers of MYBPC3 mutations developed to HCM during follow-up. Maximal wall thickness was thicker in the patients carrying mutations in the global region of MYH7 than in those carrying mutations in the rod region of MYH7 (21.5 +/- 6.6 versus 15 +/- 6.1 mm, p < 0.05) at baseline. More sudden death (7/41 versus 0/11) and left ventricular dysfunction (NYHA Class III approximately IV, 17/32 versus 1/10) were identified in patients with mutations in the global region of MYH7 than in patients with other mutations. CONCLUSIONS: MYH7 mutations, especially in the global region, cause malignant clinical phenotypes.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable myocardial disease with age-related penetrance. Current guidelines recommend clinical screening of relatives beginning at 10 years of age, but the clinical value of this approach has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: Anonymized clinical data were collected from children referred for family screening between 1994 and 2017 after diagnosis of HCM in a first-degree relative. RESULTS: Of 1198 consecutive children (≤18 years of age) from 594 families who underwent serial evaluation (median, 3.5 years; interquartile range, 1.2-7), 32 individuals met diagnostic criteria at baseline (median maximal left ventricular wall thickness, 13 mm; interquartile range, 8-21 mm), and 25 additional patients developed HCM during follow-up. Median age at diagnosis was 10 years (interquartile range, 4-13 years); 44 (72%) were ≤12 years of age. Median age of affected patients at the last follow-up was 14 years (interquartile range, 9.5-18.2 years). A family history of childhood HCM was more common in those patients diagnosed with HCM (n=32 [56%] versus n=257 [23%]; P<0.001). Eighteen patients (32%) were started on medication for symptoms; 2 (4%) underwent a septal myectomy; 14 (25%) received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; 1 underwent cardiac transplantation; 2 had a resuscitated cardiac arrest; and 1 died after a cerebrovascular accident. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 5% of first-degree child relatives undergoing screening meet diagnostic criteria for HCM at first or subsequent evaluations, with the majority presenting as preadolescents; a diagnosis in a child first-degree relative is made in 8% of families screened. The phenotype of familial HCM in childhood is varied and includes severe disease, suggesting that clinical screening should begin at a younger age.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1, 1997, and February 1, 2007, 1053 unrelated patients with the clinical diagnosis of HCM (60% male; mean ± SD age at diagnosis, 44.4 ± 19 years) had HCM genetic testing for the 9 HCM-associated myofilament genes. Phenotyping was performed by review of electronic medical records. RESULTS: Overall, 359 patients (34%) were genotype positive for a putative HCM-associated mutation in 1 or more HCM-associated genes. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the echocardiographic reverse curve morphological subtype, an age at diagnosis younger than 45 years, a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm or greater, a family history of HCM, and a family history of sudden cardiac death as positive predictors of positive genetic test results, whereas hypertension was a negative predictor. A score, based on the number of predictors of a positive genetic test result, predicted a positive genetic test result ranging from 6% when only hypertension was present to 80% when all 5 positive predictor markers were present. CONCLUSION: In this largest HCM cohort published to date, the overall yield of genetic testing was 34%. Although all the patients were diagnosed clinically as having HCM, the presence or absence of 6 simple clinical/echocardiographic markers predicted the likelihood of mutation-positive HCM. Phenotype-guided genetic testing using the Mayo HCM Genotype Predictor score provides an easy tool for an effective genetic counseling session.",

        "Abstract Note": "PURPOSE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by inappropriate left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. Adaptations to exercise can occasionally mimic certain HCM characteristics. However, it is unclear whether physical activity affects HCM genotype expression and disease characteristics. Consequently, we compared lifelong physical activity volumes between HCM gene carriers with and without HCM phenotype, and compared disease characteristics among tertiles of physical activity in phenotypic HCM patients. METHODS: We enrolled n = 22 genotype positive/phenotype negative (G+/P-) HCM gene carriers, n = 44 genotype positive/phenotype positive (G+/P+) HCM patients, and n = 36 genotype negative/phenotype positive (G-/P+) HCM patients. Lifelong physical activity was recorded using a questionnaire and quantified as metabolic equivalent of task hours per week. RESULTS: We included 102 participants (51 ± 16 yr, 49% male). Lifelong physical activity volumes were not different between G+/P+ and G+/P- subjects (16 [10-29] vs 14 [6-26] metabolic equivalent of task-hours per week, P = 0.33). Among phenotypic HCM patients, there was no difference in LV wall thickness, mass, and late gadolinium enhancement across physical activity tertiles. Patients with the highest reported physical activity volumes were younger at the time of diagnosis (tertile 1: 52 ± 14 yr, tertile 2: 49 ± 15 yr, tertile 3: 41 ± 18 yr; P = 0.03), and more often had a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (4% vs 30% vs 30%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Lifelong physical activity volumes are not associated with genotype-to-phenotype transition in HCM gene carriers. We also found no difference in LV wall thickness across physical activity tertiles. However, the most active HCM patients were younger at the time of diagnosis and had a higher arrhythmic burden. These observations warrant further exploration of the role of exercise in HCM disease development.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: ECGs at the 1st grade (mean [±SD] age 6.6±0.3 years) were available for 11 patients diagnosed with HCM at around the 7th grade (13.2±0.3 years). ECGs were available for another 64 patients diagnosed with HCM in the 1st (n=15), 7th (n=32), and 10th (n=17) grades. Fifty-one voltage criteria were developed by grade and sex using 62,841 ECGs from the general population. Voltage criteria were set at the 99.95th percentile (1/2,000) point based on the estimated prevalence of childhood HCM (2.9 per 100,000 [1/34,483]) to decrease false negatives. Conventional criteria were from guidelines for school-aged children in Japan. Of 11 patients before diagnosis, 2 satisfied conventional criteria in 1st grade; 5 (56%) of the remaining 9 patients fulfilled 2 voltage criteria (R wave in limb-lead I [RI]+S wave in lead V3 [SV3] and R wave in lead V3 [RV3]+SV3). Robustness analysis for sensitivity showed RV3+SV3 was superior to RI+SV3. For all patients after diagnosis, RI+SV4 was the main candidate. However, conventional criteria were more useful than voltage criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Early HCM prediction was possible using RV3+SV3 in >50% of patients in 1st grade. Voltage criteria may help diagnose prediagnostic or early HCM, and prevent tragic accidents, although further prospective studies are required.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: ST segment depression (STD) on electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most frequently used examination to detect myocardial ischemia and myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is considered as a reliable technique to assess myocardial purfusion. However, association between two examinations and the underlying clinical implication in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients is not fully illustrated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between ECG and MCE findings in HCM patients and elucidating the underlying clinical implications. METHODS: Thirty-two patients diagnosed with HCM comprising the HCM cohort and 28 healthy individuals were enrolled as controls. The amplitude of ST segment depression (STD) was assessed, and the following MCE parameters: peak intensity (PI), area under the curve (AUC), rising slope (RS) and time to peak (TTP) were recorded and compared between the two groups, and correlation between MCE parameters and the extent of STD was calculated. Furthermore, HCM patients were categorized into three subgroups according to the severity of STD: ST1 group (0 < STD ≤ 0.1 mV); ST2 group (0.1 mV < STD ≤ 0.2 mV); ST3 group (0.2 mV < STD ≤ 0.3 mV), and data was compared among the four groups. RESULTS: ECG showed that all patients in the HCM group present STD (t = 8.294, P < 0.001). MCE showed that the values of PI, RS, and AUC were significantly reduced in the HCM group as compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Results of correlation analysis show no linear correlation between the PI values and the extent of STD (r = -0.348, P = 0.051). Of note, a significant difference in PI values between ST1 and ST3 (P = 0.01), ST2 and ST3 (P = 0.023) was observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that STD greater than 0.2 mV strongly indicates myocardial perfusion impairment in HCM patients, and can serve as a reliable index for stratifying patients and identifying those at high risk.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Hereditary transthyretin (TTR)-related amyloidosis (ATTR) is mainly considered a neurologic disease. We assessed the phenotypic and genotypic spectra of ATTR in a Caucasian area and evaluated the prevalence, genetic background, and disease profile of cases with an exclusively cardiac phenotype, highlighting possible hints for the differential diagnosis with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: In this Italian multicentre study, 186 patients with ATTR were characterized at presentation. Thirty patients with SSA and 30 age-gender-matched HCM patients were used for comparison. Phenotype was classified as exclusively cardiac (n = 31, 17%), exclusively neurologic (n = 46, 25%), and mixed cardiac/neurologic (n = 109, 58%). Among the eight different mutations responsible for an exclusively cardiac phenotype, Ile68Leu was the most frequent. Five patients with an exclusively cardiac phenotype developed mild abnormalities at neurological examination, but no symptoms during a 36-month follow-up (range: 14-50). Exclusively cardiac phenotype was characterized by male gender, age >65 years, heart failure symptoms, symmetric left ventricular (LV) 'hypertrophy', and moderately depressed LV ejection fraction. This profile was similar to SSA, but relatively distinct from HCM. Compared with patients with a mixed phenotype, patients with an exclusively cardiac phenotype showed a more pronounced cardiac involvement on both echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG). CONCLUSION: A clinically relevant subset of Caucasian ATTR patients present with an exclusively cardiac phenotype, mimicking HCM or SSA. Echocardiographic and ECG findings are useful to differentiate ATTR from HCM but not from SSA. The role of liver transplantation in these patients should be reconsidered.",

        "Abstract Note": "The burgeoning evidence of patients diagnosed with sigmoidal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) later in life has revived the quest for distinctive features that may help discriminate it from more benign forms of isolated septal hypertrophy often labelled ventricular septal bulge (VSB). HCM is diagnosed less frequently than VSB at older ages, with a reversed female predominance. Most patients diagnosed with HCM at older ages suffer from hypertension, similar to those with VSB. A positive family history of HCM and/or sudden cardiac death and the presence of exertional symptoms usually support HCM, though they are less likely in older patients with HCM, and poorly investigated in individuals with VSB. A more severe hypertrophy and the presence of left ventricular outflow obstruction are considered diagnostic of HCM, though stress echocardiography has not been consistently used in VSB. Mitral annulus calcification is very prevalent in both conditions, whereas a restrictive filling pattern is found in a minority of older patients with HCM. Genetic testing has low applicability in this differential diagnosis at the current time, given that a causative mutation is found in less than 10% of elderly patients with suspected HCM. Emerging imaging modalities that allow non-invasive detection of myocardial fibrosis and disarray may help, but have not been fully investigated. Nonetheless, there remains a considerable morphological overlap between the two conditions. Comprehensive studies, particularly imaging based, are warranted to offer a more evidence-based approach to elderly patients with focal septal thickening.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) needs careful differentiation from other cardiomyopathies. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing, but genetic data on differential diagnoses and their relation with clinical outcomes in HCM are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of genetic variants and the proportion of other cardiomyopathies in patients with suspected HCM in Korea and compare the outcomes of HCM according to the presence of sarcomere gene mutation. METHODS: We enrolled 1,554 patients with suspected HCM having left ventricular hypertrophy on transthoracic echocardiography between April 2012 and February 2023. Patients who declined genetic testing or who had pure apical HCM without a familial history were excluded. Genetic testing was performed using a next-generation sequencing panel or whole-exome sequencing for cardiomyopathies. We performed cardiovascular magnetic resonance if the diagnosis was inconclusive. Genotype-positive HCM was defined as sarcomere gene mutations of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Adverse clinical outcomes were defined as a composite of all-cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure-related admission, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks, and stroke. RESULTS: Of 492 patients (mean age 49.6 ± 14.7 years, 29.4% women) who underwent genetic testing, 214 (43.5%) had disease-causing gene mutations. After combining gene tests, multi-imaging modality, and clinical information, 447 (90.9%) had HCM, and 27 (5.5%) had Fabry disease. Among the HCM patients, 182 (40.7%) were genotype-positive, and 265 (59.3%) were genotype-negative. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that genotype-positive HCM patients experienced more composite outcomes (log-rank, P < 0.001). In multivariable Cox analysis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.12; P = 0.010), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% (HR, 5.50; 95% CI, 2.68-11.27; P < 0.001), LA reservoir strain (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.037), and positive sarcomere gene mutation (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04-2.78; P = 0.034) were significantly association with composite outcomes. Sarcomere gene mutation had incremental value for predicting adverse outcomes added on NSVT and LVEF < 50%. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing is helpful in diagnosing HCM, and sarcomere gene mutations in HCM are significantly associated with clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: The population prevalence of cardiomyopathies and the natural history of symptomatic heart failure (HF) and arrhythmia across cardiomyopathy phenotypes is poorly understood. Study aims were to estimate the population-diagnosed prevalence of cardiomyopathies and describe the temporal relationship between a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy with HF and arrhythmia. METHODS: People with cardiomyopathy (n=4116) were identified from linked electronic health records (~9 million individuals; 2000-2018) and categorised into hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Cardiomyopathy point prevalence, rates of symptomatic HF and arrhythmia and timing relative to a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were determined. RESULTS: In 2018, DCM was the most common cardiomyopathy. DCM and HCM were twice as common among men, with the reverse trend for ARVC. Between 2010 and 2018, prevalence increased for ARVC by 180% and HCM by 9%. At diagnosis, more patients with CA (66%), DCM (56%) and RCM (62%) had pre-existing HF compared with ARVC (29%) and HCM (27%). Among those free of HF at diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, annualised HF incidence was greatest in CA and DCM. Diagnoses of all cardiomyopathies clustered around the time of HF onset. CONCLUSIONS: The recorded prevalence of all cardiomyopathies increased over the past decade. Recognition of CA is generally preceded by HF, whereas individuals with ARVC or HCM more often developed HF after their cardiomyopathy diagnosis suggesting a more indolent course or better asymptomatic recognition. The clustering of HF and cardiomyopathy diagnoses suggests opportunities for presymptomatic or earlier diagnosis.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) ≥15 mm. The condition is often hereditary, and family screening is recommended to reduce the risk of adverse disease complications and premature death among relatives. Correct diagnosis of index patients is important to ensure that only relatives at risk of disease development are invited for family screening. To investigate whether patients with International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for HCM (DI421) or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) (DI422) fulfilled recognized diagnostic criteria. METHODS: All patients with ICD-10 codes for HCM or HOCM at a Department of Cardiology were identified and had their diagnosis validated by a cardiac investigation or a review of their medical records and previous investigations. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients had ICD-10 codes for HCM/HOCM, of whom 202 (84%, 202/240) underwent re-examination, while 38 (16%, 38/240) had their hospital notes reviewed. A total of 76 patients (32%, n = 76/240) did not fulfil diagnostic criteria, of whom 39 (51%, n = 39/76) had normal (10 mm) or modest LV wall thickness (11-14 mm). The remaining 37 patients (49%, n = 37/76) had LVH ≥15 mm, which was well explained by uncontrolled hypertension (32%, n = 24/76), aortic valve stenosis (19%, n = 7/76), or wild-type amyloidosis (16%, n = 6/76). CONCLUSION: One-third of patients with ICD-10 codes for HCM or HOCM did not fulfil recognized diagnostic criteria. Incorrect diagnosis of HCM may cause unnecessary family investigations, which may be associated with anxiety, and a waste of healthcare resources. This highlights the need for specialized cardiomyopathy services to ensure correct diagnosis and management of HCM.",

Accurate diagnosis is crucial for management and improving patient outcomes. The application of convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a type of AI modeling, to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, presents a promising and optimistic avenue for the detection of HCM. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of CNN models in diagnosing HCM through ECG. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane were searched up to August 12, 2024, focusing on CNN ECG-based HCM detection models. The outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and SROC. Pooled proportions were calculated using a random-effects model with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics. This study was registered on PROSPERO protocol CRD42024581925. RESULTS: Our analysis included 16 studies with ECG data from 513,972 patients. The AI algorithms employed CNNs for ECG interpretation. Sixteen studies contributed to the qualitative analysis, while seven studies for the pooled SROC with an 11 % false positive rate, with a sensitivity of 89 % (95 % CI 86-92 %) and a specificity of 88 % (95 % CI 81-93 %). CONCLUSION: AI-driven ECG interpretation shows high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting HCM, though the modest PPV suggests that AI should be integrated with clinical evaluation to enhance reliability, particularly in screening settings.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study evaluated 105 consecutive patients with HCM who had undergone phonocardiography and external pulse recording. Physical examinations included a visible jugular a-wave (Jug-a), audible 4th sound (S4), and double or sustained apex beat. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease. A total of 104 non-HCM subjects served as controls. The prevalence of visible Jug-a in the seated or supine position, audible S4, and a sustained or double apex beat in patients with HCM were 10%, 71%, 70%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, all of which were significantly higher than in the controls (0%, 20%, 11%, 17%, and 2%; P<0.001 for all comparisons). The combination of visible Jug-a in the supine position and audible S4 yielded a specificity of 94% and sensitivity of 57%. During a follow-up period of 6.6 years, 6 patients died and 10 were hospitalized. The absence of audible S4 was a predictor of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 3.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 10.8; P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of these findings has clinical importance in the diagnosis and risk stratification of HCM prior to the use of advanced imaging techniques.",

HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to estimate the association between LVGLS measured by echocardiography and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with HCM. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for evaluating the difference of LVGLS between MACE and non-MACE and the relevance of LVGLS and MACE in HCM patients, mean difference (MD), and pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Publication bias was detected by funnel plots and Egger's test, and trim-and-fill analysis was employed when publication bias existed. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies reporting 2441 HCM patients were included in this meta-analysis. Absolute value of LVGLS was lower in the group of HCM with MACE (MD = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.50-2.99, p < .001; I2  = 0, p = .48). In the pooled unadjusted model, LVGLS was related to MACE (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06-1.22, p < .05, I2  = 58.4%, p < .01) and there is a mild heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis showed stable results. In the pooled adjusted model, LVGLS was related to MACE (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.08-1.16, p < .05; I2  = 0%, p = .442). Egger's tests showed publication bias, and trim-and-fill analysis was applied, with final results similar to the previous and still statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggested that impaired LVGLS was associated with poor prognosis in HCM patients.",

However, the value of family screening in relatives of index patients with a normal genetic investigation of recognized HCM genes is largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to perform family screening among relatives of HCM index patients with a normal genetic investigation to establish the frequency of familial disease and the clinical characteristics of affected individuals. METHODS: Clinical and genetic investigations were performed in consecutive and unrelated HCM index patients. Relatives of index patients who did not carry pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in recognized HCM genes were invited for clinical investigations. RESULTS: In total, 60% (270 of 453) of HCM index patients had a normal genetic investigation. A total of 80% of their relatives (751 of 938, median age 44 years) participated in the study. Of these, 5% (34 of 751) were diagnosed with HCM at baseline, whereas 0.3% (2 of 717 [751-34]) developed the condition during 5 years of follow-up. Their median age at diagnosis was 57 years (IQR: 51-70 years). Two-thirds (22 of 36) were diagnosed following family screening, whereas one-third (14 of 36) had been diagnosed previously because of cardiac symptoms, a murmur, or an abnormal electrocardiogram. None of the affected relatives experienced adverse disease complications. The risk of SCD was low. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic family screening of index patients with HCM and normal genetic investigations was associated with a low frequency of affected relatives who appeared to have a favorable prognosis.",

Our goal was to identify modifiable risk factors to attenuate clinical expression of HCM, enabling management evolution from a mostly passive strategy of risk stratification to a proactive strategy of modifying disease expression. METHODS: Using nationwide population-based data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, 28,679,891 people who were free of prevalent HCM and who underwent health examinations between 2009 and 2015 were followed until 31 December 2016. The primary outcome was clinical HCM that was defined as incident diagnosis of HCM during the follow-up, after a blanking period of 12 months. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 0.027% (n = 7851) of the study participants were diagnosed as incident HCM. The incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 0.059. A significant association was found between body mass index (BMI) and the incidence of clinical HCM after multivariate adjustment, with a hazard ratio per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI of 1.063 (95% confidence interval 1.051-1.075). Metabolically unhealthy participants had a greater incidence of HCM than metabolically healthy participants, regardless of obesity status. The effect of BMI was more pronounced in several subgroups, including participants with no hypertension, those aged less than 65 years and men. CONCLUSION: We found that individuals with obesity and/or metabolic abnormalities had a significantly higher incidence of clinical HCM diagnosis than their counterparts. Efforts to manage obesity and metabolic abnormalities may be important in modifying clinical expression of HCM.",

However, since these models do not rely on discrete measurements as inputs, it is not apparent what drives their performance. We hypothesized that saliency maps could be used to visually identify ECG segments that contribute to a CNN's robust classification of HCM. METHODS: We derived a new one‑lead (lead I) CNN model based on median beats using the same methodology and cohort used for the original 12‑lead CNN model (3047 patients with HCM, and 63,926 sex- and age-matched non-HCM controls). One‑lead, median-beat saliency maps were generated and visually evaluated in an independent cohort of 100 patients with a diagnosis of HCM and a high artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG-HCM probability score to determine which ECG segments contributed to the model's detection of HCM. RESULTS: The one‑lead, median-beat CNN had an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.89-0.92) for HCM detection, similar to the original 12‑lead ECG model. In the independent HCM cohort (n = 100), saliency maps highlighted the ST-T segment in 92 ECGs, the atrial depolarization segment in 12 ECGs, and the QRS complex in 5 ECGs. CONCLUSIONS: Saliency maps of a one‑lead, median-beat-based CNN model identified perturbations in ventricular repolarization as the main region of interest in detecting HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "PURPOSE: To validate diagnostic codes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), analyze misclassfications, and estimate the prevalence of HCM in an unselected Swedish regional cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the hospitals' electronic medical records (used for the Swedish National Patient Register), we identified 136 patients from 2006 to 2016 with the HCM-related codes 142.1 and 142.2 (International Classification of Diseases). RESULTS: Of a total of 129 residents in the catchment area, 88 patients were correctly classified as HCM (positive predictive value 68.2%) and 41 patients (31.8%) were misclassified as HCM. Among the 88 HCM patients (52.2% males), 74 were alive and 14 were dead (15.9%). This yields an HCM prevalence of 74/183,337, that is, 4.0 diagnosed cases per 10,000 in the adult population aged ≥18 years. The underlying diagnoses of misclassified cases were mainly hypertension (31.7%) and aortic stenosis (22.0%). Other types of cardiomyopathies accounted for several cases of misclassification: dilated (nonischemic or ischemic), left ventricular noncompaction, and Takotsubo. Miscellaneous diagnoses were amyloidosis, pulmonary stenosis combined with ventricular septal defect, aortic insufficiency, athelete's heart, and atrioventricular conduction abnormality. The mean age was not significantly different between HCM and misclassified patients (65.8±15.8 vs 70.1±13.4 years; P=0.177). There were 47.8% females among HCM and 60.8% females among misclassified (P=0.118). CONCLUSION: One-third of patients diagnosed as HCM are misclassified, so registry data should be interpreted with caution. A correct diagnosis is important for decision-making and implementation of optimal HCM care; efforts should be made to increase awareness of HCM and diagnostic competence throughout the health care system.",

Data on the prognosis of this HCM subgroup appear conflicting. Our study aims to clarify the natural history of ApHCM and identify predictors of outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 856 patients with HCM were retrospectively examined. ApHCM was defined as asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy confined predominantly at the apex, either isolated (pure ApHCM type) or with co-existent hypertrophy of the interventricular septum (mixed ApHCM). Echocardiographic, clinical, and survival data were compared between individuals with ApHCM and non-ApHCM. RESULTS: A total of 143 (16.7%) patients were diagnosed with ApHCM. Compared with non-ApHCM, subjects with apical HCM were diagnosed at an older age and had better echocardiographic indices and more comorbidities at baseline. Apical aneurysms were more prevalent among the ApHCM phenotype (6.3% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.003). During a mean follow-up of 6 ± 3 years, ApHCM was characterized by lower all-cause, cardiovascular, heart failure-related mortality, and ventricular arrhythmic events compared with non-ApHCM. Multivariate analysis identified atrial fibrillation and HCM risk-sudden cardiac death (SCD) as independent predictors of the composite outcome of overall mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons (hazard ratio [HR] 4.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-9.5 for atrial fibrillation and HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.02-1.3 for HCM risk-SCD) in ApHCM. CONCLUSIONS: ApHCM exhibited a lower rate of all-cause mortality and arrhythmic events in the middle-aged population of patients with HCM. Atrial fibrillation and HCM risk-sudden cardiac death were independent predictors of a composite of overall mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations among those with ApHCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often associated with ischaemia despite lack of focal epicardial coronary stenosis. Our aim was to assess invasive coronary microvascular circulation and correlate findings with echocardiography. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with HCM and controls who were referred for diagnostic coronary angiography. A pressure-temperature sensor coronary guidewire was used with intracoronary injections of room-temperature saline to measure mean coronary transit time during rest and hyperaemia induced with intravenous adenosine. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) was calculated. Left ventricular mass was calculated during echocardiographic studies. RESULTS: Patients with HCM (n=12) and controls (n=7), had similar demographics. Left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in HCM (76.7%±11.0% vs 55.0%±15.9%, p=0.003). IMR was non-significantly higher in HCM (21.7±10.2 vs 15.3±4.8, p=0.16). Only patients with HCM had abnormal IMR (>25). Coronary flow reserve was non-significantly higher in HCM (2.7±1.6 vs 2.1±1.2, p=0.34). IMR correlated with left ventricular mass in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subjects (Pearson r=0.68, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular dysfunction as assessed by IMR may be abnormal in HCM and is correlated with left ventricular mass.",

        "Abstract Note": "IMPORTANCE: Diagnostic screening for Anderson-Fabry cardiomyopathy (AFC) is performed in the presence of specific clinical red flags in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) older than 25 years. However, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) has been traditionally considered an exclusion criteria for AFC. OBJECTIVE: To examine a series of patients diagnosed with HCM and severe basal LVOTO undergoing myectomy in whom the diagnosis of AFC was suspected by the cardiac surgeon intraoperatively and confirmed by histological and genetic examinations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective analysis of patients undergoing surgical septal reduction strategies was conducted in 3 European tertiary referral centers for HCM from July 2013 to December 2016. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of obstructive HCM referred for surgical management of LVOTO were observed for at least 18 months after the procedure (mean [SD] follow-up, 33 [14] months). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Etiology of patients with HCM who underwent surgical myectomy. RESULTS: From 2013, 235 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of HCM underwent septal myectomy. The cardiac surgeon suspected a storage disease in 3 patients (1.3%) while inspecting their heart samples extracted from myectomy. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for these 3 patients was 42 (4) years; all were male. None of the 3 patients presented with extracardiac features suggestive of AFC. All patients showed asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, with maximal left ventricular thickness in the basal septum (19-31 mm), severe basal LVOTO (70-120 mm Hg), and left atrial dilatation (44-57 mm). Only 1 patient presented with late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance at the right ventricle insertion site. The mean (SD) age at surgical procedure was 63 (5) years. On tactile sensation, the surgeon felt a spongy consistency of the surgical samples, different from the usual stony-elastic consistency typical of classic HCM, and this prompted histological examinations. Histology showed evidence of intracellular storage, and genetic analysis confirmed a GLA A gene mutation (p.Asn215Ser) in all 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening for AFC should be performed even in the absence of red flags in patients with HCM older than 25 years.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Contemporary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family screening includes clinical evaluation and genetic testing (GT). This screening strategy requires the identification of a pathogenic mutation in the proband. Our aim was to examine the results of this HCM screening strategy. METHODS: Between 1985 and 2016, 777 relatives of 209 probands were assessed in the context of HCM screening. Genotype-positive (G+) relatives and relatives without genetic testing (GT) underwent repeated clinical evaluations. In genotype-negative (G-) relatives mortality was assessed during follow-up. RESULTS: A pathogenic mutation was identified in 72% of probands. After counseling, GT was performed in 620 (80%) relatives: 264 (43%) were G+ (age 41±18 y) and 356 (57%) were G- (age 48±17 y). At first screening, HCM was diagnosed in 98 (37%) G+ relatives and 28 (17%) relatives without GT (p<0.001). During 9 years follow-up of relatives diagnosed with HCM, 8 (6%) underwent septal reduction therapy, 16 (16%) received primary prevention ICDs, and cardiac mortality was 0.3%/year. During 7 years follow-up of relatives without HCM, 29 (16%) developed HCM. Survival at 5/10 years was 99%/95% in G+ relatives, 97%/94% in G- relatives (p=0.8), and 100%/100% in relatives without GT. CONCLUSIONS: HCM was identified in 30% of relatives at first screening, and 16% developed HCM during 7 years of repeated evaluation. GT led to a discharge from clinical follow-up in 46% of the study population. Survival in the relatives was good.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend medications with rate control properties for symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) based on the rationale that lowering heart rate (HR) improves their symptoms. Whether sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with increased HR in HCM patients is not known. METHOD: We diagnosed uncontrolled SDB (oxygen desaturation index ≥5) in consecutive echocardiographically confirmed HCM patients seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, and analyzed their HR as recorded by a 24-h Holter monitor. We compared mean, minimum, maximum HR between those with vs without SDB. In a pilot subanalysis of HCM patients with SDB who also underwent subsequent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG), we analyzed RR interval changes coinciding with obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea episodes. RESULTS: Of the 230 HCM patients included in this study (age 54 ± 16 years; 138 male; LVOT pressure gradient at rest 45 ± 39 mmHg), 115 (50%) patients had SDB. HCM patients with SDB were recorded to have higher mean HR (71 vs. 67 bpm; p = .002, adjusted p = .001), and this difference was most pronounced during night hours of 10 PM to 5 AM (61 vs. 67 bpm; p < .001). In the pilot analysis of the available PSG data, the release of obstructive sleep apneas and hypopneas coincided with fluctuation of HR. CONCLUSIONS: SDB is independently associated with higher mean HR in patients with HCM, and this difference is most significant during sleep. Treatment of SDB, which is readily available, should be tested as a complementary modality to the currently recommended pharmacotherapy aimed at lowering HR in patients with symptomatic HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), documented in a significant portion of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, has been shown to adversely impact prognosis. In most HCM patients congestive symptoms are consistently elicited by exercise, thus suggesting the need for a provocative test to assess cardiac hemodynamics during effort. Combining cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with echocardiography, we aimed to evaluate the presence of exercise induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (EiPAH), its role in functional limitation and its prognostic significance in a cohort of patients with obstructive and non-obstructive HCM. Study population included 182 HCM patients evaluated combining CPET and stress echocardiography. Left-ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocities, trans-tricuspid gradient, and cardiopulmonary variables were continuously measured. Thirty-seven patients (20%) developed EiPAH, defined as systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) > 40 mmHg during exercise. EiPAH was associated with lower exercise performance, larger left atrial volumes, higher LVOT gradient and higher VE/VCO2 slope. At multivariable analysis baseline sPAP (p < 0.0001) and baseline LVOT obstruction (p = 0.028) were significantly associated with EiPAH. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed EiPAH was a significant predictor of HCM-related morbidity (Hazard Ratio 6.21, 95% CI 1.47-26.19; p = 0.05; 4.21, 95% CI 1.94-9.12; p < 0.001 for the primary and the secondary endpoint respectively). EiPAH was present in about one fifth of HCM patients without evidence of elevated pulmonary pressures at rest and was associated with adverse clinical outcome. Diagnosing EiPAH by exercise echocardiography/CPET may help physicians to detect early stage of PAH thus allowing a closer clinical monitoring and individualized therapies.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: ECG-derived vectorcardiography (VCG) has diagnostic and prognostic value in various diseases. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a genetic disease with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy, is one of the most common causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young persons. Genotype positive status is associated with increased risk of systolic dysfunction, heart failure, and (SCD). Herein, we aimed to determine the diagnostic utility of derived VCG parameters in a large cohort of genotyped HCM patients. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2007, genetic testing was performed on 1053 unrelated patients with HCM. Of these, 967 had 12-lead ECGs suitable for computerized derivation of VCG parameters, including the spatial mean and peaks QRS-T angles, spatial ventricular gradient (SVG), spatial QRS, QT, and Tpeak-Tend (TpTe) intervals. ECGs were also evaluated using Seattle ECG criteria. Differences between HCM patients and healthy controls as well as between genotype positive versus genotype negative HCM patients were assessed. RESULTS: Spatial peaks (129.3±26.4 vs.30.5±24.2 degrees) and spatial mean QRS-T angles (121.8±38.6 vs. 47.3±27.6 degrees) were significantly higher in patients with HCM than in controls (P<0.001). The spatial peaks and mean QRS-T angles identified 94% and 84% of HCM patients, respectively, while Seattle criteria identified 70.7% of patients (P<0.001). Genotype positive patients had higher spatial mean QRS-T angles, spatial TpTe (P<0.001 respectively), spatial peaks QRS-T angles (P=0.017) and lower SVG (P<0.001) than genotype negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: ECG-derived spatial QRS-T angles can differentiate patients with HCM from controls and could provide a better tool than traditional Seattle criteria. Clinical usefulness of VCG to differentiate genotype-negative from genotype-positive patients has yet to be established.",

        "Abstract Note": "PURPOSE: Although several studies have reported the morphological and electrical characteristics in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), comparison between asymmetric and apical HCM has not been investigated in a reasonably sized cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echocardiography and electrocardiography were quantitatively analyzed in patients with HCM in a Korean tertiary referral center. RESULTS: Of 864 patients (mean age 55.4±14.2 years, 68.9% men), 255 (29.5%) patients had apical HCM, 553 (64.0%) patients asymmetric HCM, and 56 (6.4%) patients mixed type HCM. In echocardiographic evaluations, about three quarters of patients (75.8%) had left atrial enlargement. Left ventricular (LV) dilatations and systolic dysfunction were observed in 6.1% and 2.4%, respectively. QRS widening, PR prolongation, and pathologic Q wave are frequent in patients with asymmetric HCM, while LV strain is frequent in patient with apical HCM. The prevalence of J-point elevations (9.4% in inferior, 2.2% in lateral leads) were substantially higher than that in general population. Giant negative T wave was observed in 15.0% of total patients (32.2% in apical, 6.2% in asymmetric, 25% in mixed type). There was no significant correlation between the thickness of the apical wall and the amplitude of T wave inversion (r=-0.005, p=0.71). CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of HCM including apical type, repolarization abnormalities, including early repolarization and QT prolongation as well as LV strain, were significantly observed. T wave inversion was not appropriate for screening of HCM and not correlated with apical wall thickness.",

METHODS: The 12-lead ECGs from Preparticipation screening in healthy athletes and patients with HCM were studied retrospectively. All 12 leads were measured using the same automated ECG analysis program. RESULTS: There were a total of 225 HCM patients and 1124 athletes with 12-lead electrocardiograms available for analysis. Athletes were on average 20 years of age, 65% were male and 24% were African-American. Patients with HCM were on average 51 years of age, 56% were male and 5.8% were African-American. Q waves by either amplitude, duration or area criteria were more prevalent in males than females, in lateral leads than inferior and in HCM patients than athletes. The most striking difference in Q waves between the groups was in Limb lead I and in the females. Tall, skinny Q waves were rare in athletes and had the highest prevalence of only 3.7% in male HCM patients. CONCLUSION: Q waves are more common in males compared to females and in patients with HCM compared to athletes. Q waves of 30 ms or more in limb lead I appear to offer the greatest discriminatory value for separating patients with HCM from athletes.",

This study aimed to assess ECG and echocardiographic parameters proposed for the differential diagnosis of HCM. The study included 75 men in three groups: control (n=30), \"gray zone\" athletes with interventricular septum (IVS) measuring 13-15mm (n=25) and HCM patients with IVS of 13-18mm (n=20). The most significant differences were found in relative septal thickness (RST), calculated as the ratio of 2 x IVS to left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LV-EDD) (0.37, 0.51, 0.71, respectively; p<0.01) and in spatial QRS-T angle as visually estimated (9.8, 33.6, 66.2, respectively; p<0.01). The capacity for differential HCM diagnosis of each of the 5 criteria was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), as follows: LV-EDD<54 (0.60), family history (0.61), T-wave inversion (TWI) (0.67), spatial QRS-T angle>45 (0.75) and RST>0.54 (0.92). Pearson correlation between spatial QRS-T angle>45 and TWI was 0.76 (p 0.01). The combination of spatial QRS-T angle>45 and RST>0.54 for diagnosis of HCM had an AUC of 0.79. The best diagnostic criteria for HCM was RST>0.54. The spatial QRS-T angle>45 did not add sensitivity if TWI was present. No additional improvement in differential diagnosis was obtained by combining parameters.",

We studied the diagnostic value of native T1 mapping to detect cardiac amyloidosis in patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five patients with increased LV wall thickness (≥ 12 mm end-diastole) who received clinical CMR in a 3 T scanner between 2017 and 2020 were included. 31 subjects without structural heart disease served as controls. Native T1 was measured as global mean value from 3 LV short axis slices. The study was registered at German clinical trial registry (DRKS00022048). RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 66 ± 14 years, 83% were males. CA was present in 24 patients, 21 patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 80 patients suffered from hypertensive heart disease (HHD). Native T1 times were higher in patients with CA (1409 ± 59 ms, p < 0.0001) compared to healthy controls (1225 ± 21 ms), HCM (1266 ± 44 ms) and HHD (1257 ± 41 ms). HCM and HHD patients did not differ in their native T1 times but were increased compared to control (p < 0.01). ROC analysis of native T1 demonstrated an area under the curve for the detection of CA vs. HCM and HHD of 0.9938 (p < 0.0001), which was higher than that of extracellular volume (0.9876) or quantitative late gadolinium enhancement (0.9406; both p < 0.0001). The optimal cut-off value of native T1 to diagnose CA was 1341 ms (sensitivity 100%, specificity 97%).

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in our understanding of the genetic causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a large portion of this patient population do not carry sarcomere gene mutations when screened. It remains largely unknown why patients without sarcomere mutations develop asymmetric myocardial hypertrophy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of probands with HCM who underwent genetic testing to determine if clinical phenotypes were different depending on sarcomere mutation status. A medical history, three generation family history and clinical phenotyping were performed on 127 probands with HCM. Genetic screening was performed using clinically available HCM genetic testing panels. RESULTS: We found that probands with HCM with pathogenic sarcomere mutations were over three times more likely to have a family history of HCM (66% vs 17%, p<0.0001) and were diagnosed with HCM at a much younger age (32 vs 51 years old, p<0.0001). In contrast, probands with HCM without sarcomere mutations were significantly more obese (body surface area p=0.003, body mass index p=0.04 adjusted for age) and were more likely to present with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (p=0.0483). CONCLUSION: Patients with sarcomere mutation negative HCM present at an older age and are more obese compared with patients with sarcomere mutation positive HCM. The role of ageing and obesity in asymmetric myocardial hypertrophy warrants further investigation.",

BACKGROUND: Although prenatal diagnosis is possible, there is a paucity of information about fetal CM. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 61 consecutive fetal cases with a diagnosis of CM at a single center between 2000 and 2012. RESULTS: Nonhypertrophic CM (NHCM) was diagnosed in 40 and hypertrophic CM (HCM) in 21 fetuses at 24.7 ± 5.7 gestational weeks. Etiologies included familial (13%), inflammatory (15%), and genetic-metabolic (28%) disorders, whereas 44% were idiopathic. The pregnancy was terminated in 13 of 61 cases (21%). Transplantation-free survival from diagnosis to 1 month and 1 year of life for actively managed patients was better in those with NHCM (n = 31; 58% and 58%, respectively) compared with those with HCM (n = 17; 35% and 18%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12 to 0.72; p = 0.007). Baseline echocardiographic variables associated with mortality in actively managed patients included ventricular septal thickness (HR: 1.21 per z-score increment; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.36; p = 0.002), cardiothoracic area ratio (HR: 1.06 per percent increment; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.10; p = 0.006), ≥3 abnormal diastolic Doppler flow indexes (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.95; p = 0.02), gestational age at CM diagnosis (HR: 0.91 per week increment; 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.99; p = 0.03), and, for fetuses in sinus rhythm, a lower cardiovascular profile score (HR: 1.45 per point decrease; 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.79; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal CM originates from a broad spectrum of etiologies and is associated with substantial mortality. Early echocardiographic findings appear useful in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that global longitudinal strain (GLS) is altered in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in comparison with athletes. Nevertheless, these results rely on studies comparing sedentary patients with HCM with healthy athletes. The aims of this study were to confirm these findings in an appropriate group of athletes with HCM and to study the additive value of novel parameters (i.e., mechanical dispersion and exercise GLS). METHODS: Thirty-six athletes with HCM were prospectively included and were compared with 36 sedentary patients with HCM, 36 healthy athletes, and 36 sedentary control subjects of similar age. Athlete groups had similar training duration and HCM groups similar maximal wall thickness. All underwent echocardiography at rest and during submaximal exercise. GLS was assessed; the SD of time to maximal myocardial shortening of longitudinal strain was calculated as a parameter of mechanical dispersion. RESULTS: The HCM sedentary group showed the lowest resting and exercise GLS. Resting GLS was not different between athletes with HCM and the two control groups, but exercise GLS enabled the differentiation of athletes with HCM from healthy athletes. Mechanical dispersion was higher in both HCM groups compared with both control groups at rest and during exercise. Receiver operating characteristic analysis in the athlete groups demonstrated that resting mechanical dispersion (area under the curve = 0.949 ± 0.023) had better ability to identify HCM compared with GLS at rest (area under the curve = 0.644 ± 0.069) (P < .001) or during exercise (area under the curve = 0.706 ± 0.066) (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: In athletes, normal resting GLS does not rule out the diagnosis of HCM. Mechanical dispersion of longitudinal strain seems to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of HCM in athletes.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: While patients with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis are easily diagnosed with bone scintigraphy, the detection of cardiac light chain (AL) amyloidosis is challenging. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) analyses play an essential role in the differential diagnosis of cardiomyopathies; however, limited data are available from cardiac AL-Amyloidosis. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to analyze the potential role of CMR in the detection of cardiac AL-amyloidosis. METHODS: We included 35 patients with proved cardiac AL-amyloidosis and two control groups constituted by 330 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 70 patients with arterial hypertension (HT), who underwent CMR examination. The phenotype and degree of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the amount and pattern of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) were evaluated. In addition, global and regional LV strain parameters were also analyzed using feature-tracking techniques. Sensitivity and specificity of several CMR parameters were analyzed in diagnosing cardiac AL-amyloidosis. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of diffuse septal subendocardial LGE in diagnosing cardiac AL-amyloidosis was 88% and 100%, respectively. Likewise, the sensitivity and specificity of septal myocardial nulling prior to blood pool was 71% and 100%, respectively. In addition, a LV end-diastolic septal wall thickness ≥ 15 mm had an optimal diagnostic performance to differentiate cardiac AL-amyloidosis from HT (sensitivity 91%, specificity 89%). On the other hand, a reduced global LV longitudinal strain (< 15%) plus apical sparing (apex-to-base longitudinal strain > 2) had a very low sensitivity (6%) in detecting AL-Amyloidosis, but with very high specificity (100%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that CMR could have an optimal diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of cardiac AL-amyloidosis. Hence, further larger studies are warranted to validate the findings from this study.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: In athletes, ECG changes from physiological cardiac remodelling are common but can overlap with findings from a pathological disorder. We compared ECG findings in a group of elite high school athletes to a cohort of adolescents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS/RESULTS: We prospectively performed 15-lead ECGs and echocardiograms in 147 elite high school athletes. Student-athlete ECGs were compared in blinded fashion to ECGs of 148 adolescents with HCM of similar age and ethnicity. Standard ECG hypertrophy criteria and established expert opinion guidelines (European Society of Cardiology, ESC and Seattle criteria) were analysed. All student-athletes had normal echocardiograms. Overall, 77/147 (52%) of student-athletes met standard ECG criteria for ventricular hypertrophy compared to 126/148 (85%) adolescents with HCM (p<0.0001). There were 112/148 (76%) adolescents with HCM who had pathological Q-waves, T-wave inversion and/or ST-segment depression compared to 1/147 (1%) athletes (p<0.0001). Most patients with HCM (84%, 124/148) had ≥1 abnormal ECG finding(s) according to Seattle criteria, compared to 1% of student-athletes (2/147). Similarly, 130/148 (88%) patients with HCM met group-2 ESC criteria (abnormal), compared to 36/147 (24%) student-athletes (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Over 50% of elite high school athletes with echocardiographically confirmed normal hearts satisfied standard voltage criteria for ventricular hypertrophy. Pathological Q-waves, T-wave inversion or ST-segment depression were most helpful in distinguishing adolescents with HCM from normals. Both ESC and Seattle criteria successfully stratified the student-athlete and HCM cohorts, however each had a false-negative rate >10% for the HCM cohort. The Seattle criteria demonstrated a significantly lower false-positive rate (1%) than the ESC criteria (24%).",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease characterized by substantial genetic, morphologic, and prognostic heterogeneity. Recently, sex-related differences in HCM were reported, with women being older at diagnosis and exhibiting greater left ventricular outflow tract obstruction than men. We sought to evaluate the influence of sex on the HCM phenotype in a large cohort of unrelated patients with genetically and morphologically classified HCM. METHODS: Comprehensive genotyping of 13 HCM-susceptibility genes encoding myofilament and Z-disc proteins of the cardiac sarcomere was performed previously on 382 unrelated patients with HCM. Blinded to the genotype, the septal morphology was graded as reverse-curvature, sigmoidal, apical, or neutral-contour HCM by echocardiography. RESULTS: Overall, women (a) were significantly older at diagnosis (45.1 +/- 20 vs 35.8 +/- 17 years, P < .001), (b) had greater left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (53.5 +/- 45 vs 41.7 +/- 42 mm Hg, P = .009), (c) were more likely to have concomitant hypertension (19% vs 11%, P = .02), and (d) had a higher rate of surgical myectomy (49% vs 36%, P = .01) than men. Interestingly, these sex-based differences were apparent only among patients with sigmoidal HCM (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this largest cohort of comprehensively genotyped and morphologically classified patients with clinically diagnosed HCM, we observed that the striking sex-related differences in the clinical phenotype are confined largely to the subset of mutation-negative sigmoidal HCM. Whereas mutations within the sarcomere appear to dominate the disease process, in their absence, sex has a significant modifying effect, specifically noted in cases of sigmoidal HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Conventional phonocardiography is useful for objective assessment of cardiac auscultation, but its availability is limited. More recently, an ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement system equipped with simple phonocardiography has become widely used for diagnosing peripheral artery disease, however, whether this simple phonocardiography can be an alternative to conventional phonocardiography remains unclear.This retrospective study consisted of 48 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 107 controls. The presence of the fourth sound (S4) was assessed by conventional phonocardiography, in addition to apexcardiography and auscultation, in all patients with HCM. S4 was also estimated by the ABI measurement system with the phonocardiographic microphone on the sternum (the standard method) or at the apex (the apex method) in HCM patients and controls.S4 on conventional phonocardiography was detected in 42 of 48 patients (88%) with HCM. Auscultation for the detection of S4 had a sensitivity of 0.78, specificity of 0.57, and accuracy of 0.75. These diagnostic values were generally superior to those of the standard method using the ABI measurement system, whereas the apex method using the ABI measurement system had better diagnostic values, with an excellent specificity of 1.0, sensitivity of 0.77, and accuracy of 0.80. No significant differences were observed in low ABI defined as < 0.9.Simple phonocardiography equipped with the ABI measurement system may be an alternative to conventional phonocardiography for the detection of S4 in patients with HCM when the phonocardiographic microphone is moved from the sternum to the apex.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Two-dimensional echocardiography is currently the standard test for the clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The present study was undertaken to determine whether cardiac MRI (CMR) affords greater accuracy than echocardiography in establishing the diagnosis and assessing the magnitude of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (age 34+/-16 years) suspected of having HCM (or with a confirmed diagnosis) were imaged by both echocardiography and CMR to assess LV wall thickness in 8 anatomic segments (total n=384 segments) and compared in a blinded fashion. Maximum LV thickness was similar by echocardiography (21.7+/-9.1 mm) and CMR (22.5+/-9.6 mm; P=0.21). However, in 3 (6%) of the 48 patients, echocardiography did not demonstrate LV hypertrophy, and CMR identified otherwise undetected areas of wall thickening in the anterolateral LV free wall (17 to 20 mm), which resulted in a new diagnosis of HCM. In the overall study group, compared with CMR, echocardiography also underestimated the magnitude of hypertrophy in the basal anterolateral free wall (by 20+/-6%; P=0.001), as well as the presence of extreme LV wall thickness (> or =30 mm) in 10% of patients (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CMR is capable of identifying regions of LV hypertrophy not readily recognized by echocardiography and was solely responsible for diagnosis of the HCM phenotype in an important minority of patients. CMR enhances the assessment of LV hypertrophy, particularly in the anterolateral LV free wall, and represents a powerful supplemental imaging test with distinct diagnostic advantages for selected HCM patients.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-six HCM mutation carriers from 32 families identified by predictive DNA testing underwent cardiac evaluation including history, examination, electrocardiography, Doppler echocardiography, exercise testing, and 24 h Holter monitoring. The published diagnostic criteria for HCM in adult members of affected families were used to diagnose HCM. Thirty-three (43%) men and 43 (57%) women with a mean age of 42 years (range 16-79) were examined; in 31 (41%) HCM was diagnosed. Disease penetrance was age related and men were more often affected than women (P = 0.04). Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3) mutation carriers were affected at higher age than Myosin Heavy Chain (MYH7) mutation carriers (P = 0.01). Risk factors for SCD were present in affected and unaffected carriers. CONCLUSION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 41% of carriers. Disease penetrance was age dependent, warranting repeated cardiologic evaluation. The MYBPC3 mutation carriers were affected at higher age than MYH7 mutation carriers. Risk factors for SCD were present in carriers with and without HCM. Follow-up studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of risk stratification for SCD in this population.",

This study aims to explore the association between cardiac-specific biomarkers, CMR myocardial strain, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and LGE in HCM patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF) and investigate the predictive values of these indexes for LGE. We recruited 33 healthy volunteers and 86 HCM patients with preserved EF to undergo contrast-enhanced CMR examinations. In total, 48 of 86 HCM patients had the presence of LGE. The LGE-positive patients had significant higher serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP) levels and lower global longitudinal (GLS) and circumferential (GCS) strains than the LGE-negative group. The LGE% was independently associated with the Nt-proBNP levels, GCS, LV end-diastolic maximum wall thickness (MWT) and beta-blocker treatment. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the combined parameters of Nt-proBNP ≥ 108.00 pg/mL and MWT ≥ 17.30 mm had good diagnostic performance for LGE, with a specificity of 81.25% and sensitivity of 70.00%. These data indicate that serum Nt-proBNP is a potential biomarker associated with LGE% and, combined with MWT, were useful for identifying myocardial fibrosis in HCM patients with preserved EF. Additionally, LV GCS may be a more sensitive indicator for reflecting the presence of myocardial fibrosis than GLS.",

        "Abstract Note": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia observed in hypertropic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is associated with an acute deterioration. Recently, P wave dispersion (PWD) reflecting inhomogeneous atrial conduction has been proposed as being useful for the estimation of paroxysmal AF. In this study, we aimed to define the clinical, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic predictors for AF occurrence in patients with HCM. Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with HCM and having a history of documented AF attack were compared with 53 age- and gender-matched patients who had no such history. LA diameter was significantly greater and gradient in the left ventricle outflow tract was lower in patients with AF than those without AF. Maximum P-wave duration (Pmax), PWD and PTF1 values were significantly higher in patients with AF. A Pmax>134.5 ms separated the patients with AF from controls with a sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 80%. APWD value>52.5 ms separated patients from controls with a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 91% and a positive predictive accuracy of 84%. An LA diameter>4.2 cm separated patients from controls with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 81%. We concluded that LA diameter and PWD values are the most significant predictors for AF occurrence in patients with HCM, and simply by measuring Pmax and PWD values, we could easily identify the patients with high risk, and prescribe the necessary treatment and follow-up protocols for such patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "PurposeHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is considered a hereditary autosomal dominant condition, but genetic testing is positive in only half of patients. In patients with negative genetic tests, the inheritance pattern and utility of family screening are unclear.MethodsSubjects with HCM were prospectively enrolled in a registry. A survey at a median follow-up of 4 years determined the yield of family screening.ResultsThe outcome of cardiac screening on 267 family members was reported by 120 survey respondents. Subjects with positive genetic test or family history (n=74, 62%) reported an HCM diagnosis in 34 of 203 first-degree relatives who were screened (17%). Affected family members were diagnosed at a mean age of 30-39 years, and 22 of 34 experienced HCM-related adverse events (65%). Gene test-negative subjects with no prior family history of HCM (n=46, 38%) reported an HCM diagnosis in only 2 of 64 first-degree relatives who were screened (3%, p<0.001). These two individuals were diagnosed at age >40 years without HCM-related adverse events.ConclusionHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disorder, only half of which tracks with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Negative genetic testing and family history indicates a more complex genetic basis corresponding to low risk for family members.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) apical aneurysm is a unique morphological entity and novel adverse risk marker existing within the broad phenotypic spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Its true prevalence in the HCM population is likely underestimated because of inherent limitations of conventional noncontrast echocardiography. The authors hypothesized that contrast echocardiography is a reliable imaging technique compared with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for the detection of apical aneurysms. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of contrast echocardiography in the detection of LV apical aneurysms in patients with HCM in comparison with the gold standard, CMR. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients with HCM identified from an institutional clinical database, who underwent echocardiographic and CMR examinations within 12 months and had LV apical aneurysms identified on either or both imaging modalities, were retrospectively analyzed. Discordant cases were reviewed by an expert panel, and a consensus was reached regarding the presence or absence of an apical aneurysm. The reason for any discrepancy was recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 59 ± 13 years, and 73% were men. Sixty-four (57%) underwent contrast echocardiography. The median interval between echocardiography and CMR was 118 days (interquartile range, 61-237 days). Thirty-nine patients (35%) had discordance between echocardiographic and CMR findings, of whom 20 had aneurysms reported on echocardiography but not CMR and 19 vice versa. Upon reanalysis by the expert panel, aneurysms were initially missed on CMR in 16 patients (80%), largely because of interpretation error secondary to small aneurysms, with a mean aneurysm size of 0.82 ± 0.38 cm in these cases. Before secondary review by the expert panel, contrast echocardiography had sensitivity of 97% compared with 85% for CMR (P = .0198) and 64% for noncontrast echocardiography (P = .0001). After secondary review, contrast echocardiography had sensitivity of 98% compared with 67% for noncontrast echocardiography (P = .0001) and 97% for CMR (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Contrast echocardiography has high sensitivity for detecting LV apical aneurysms and should be used routinely in the evaluation and risk stratification of patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction [LVOTO; pressure gradient (PG) ≥30 mmHg] is observed in some patients without hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and it may develop especially in older patients without HCM (non-HCM). The aim of this study is to investigate if the Valsalva or an upright sitting maneuver can unveil latent LVOTO in patients with non-HCM. METHODS: A total of 33 non-HCM patients with a late peaking or dagger-shaped pulsed Doppler waveform of the LVOT and PG <30 mmHg were included. The Doppler flow velocity of the LVOT was measured at rest, after the Valsalva and a sitting maneuver. Peak PG of ≥30 mmHg after either maneuver was defined as latent LVOTO. The angle between the left ventricular septum and the aorta in the parasternal long-axis view and the apical three-chamber view was measured. RESULTS: Twenty (61 %) of the 33 patients (mean age 74 ± 9 years) were diagnosed with latent LVOTO. Of these, five (25 %) patients were diagnosed after both the Valsalva and sitting maneuver, and 15 (75 %) were diagnosed only after the sitting maneuver. The latent LVOTO group had a significantly smaller angle than the no-LVOTO group between the ventricular septum and the aorta in the parasternal long axis views (107 ± 8° vs. 117 ± 8°, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The sitting maneuver is better than the Valsalva maneuver in unveiling latent LVOTO in older, non-HCM patients.",

METHODS: Fourteen patients with AFD (55.4 +/- 9.9 years, 9 men) and 14 patients with HCM (57.2 +/- 10.9 years, 9 men) were randomly selected from a dedicated patient database. Two-dimensional echo images were blindly reviewed by 2 experienced echocardiographers. RESULTS: Maximum left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, LV end-systolic dimension, fractional shortening, and left atrial size were similar in the 2 patient groups. The LV end-diastolic dimension was smaller in patients with HCM (p = 0.04). A binary sign was present in 8 of 28 patients (29%). The sensitivity and specificity of the binary sign as a discriminator of AFD from HCM were 35% and 79%, respectively. A binary sign was present in only 1 patient with LV wall thickness <15 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The binary endocardial appearance lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as an echocardiographic screening tool.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has a poor prognosis. For correct recognition of such patients, we compared the findings in cardiac delayed enhancement (DE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-five patients (HCM 39, DCM 26) underwent gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced MRI. The HCM patients were divided into those with preserved (HCM-P, n = 30) and those with impaired systolic function (HCM-I, n = 9). DE-MRI demonstrated focal or diffuse DE at the left ventricular (LV) wall in 60% of HCM-P and 100% of HCM-I, but in only 12% of DCM. The DE distributed mainly septal to the anterior wall of LV, but the DE volume against whole LV muscle volume was much larger in HCM-I than in HCM-P and DCM (4.1 +/- 6.1% in HCM-P, 14.6 +/- 11.9% in HCM-I, and 0.8 +/- 2.4% in DCM, means +/- SD, P < .05). In HCM, there were weak but significant correlations between DE volume, and LV end-diastolic volume and LV end-systolic volume. In HCM-P, the percent of length shortening in the segments with DE was lower than that without DE. CONCLUSIONS: The HCM patients had more DE than the DCM patients, and DE volume correlated to lower global and local LV function. DE-MRI may be useful to evaluate myocardial damage in HCM patients, and to differentiate the dilated phase of HCM from DCM.",

The prevalence of FD in patients with LVH of 13 mm or greater, screened using the leucocyte alpha-galactosidase A (α-gal A) activity test, a technique that is difficult to apply routinely, ranged from 0% to 6%. OBJECTIVE: To screen systematically for FD in patients with a diagnosis of HCM (LVH ≥15 mm) in primary cardiology practice, a validated, physician-friendly α-gal A assay was used on dried blood spots using a filter paper test. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A cohort of 392 adults (278 men) followed for HCM were screened for FD. A standard blood test was used for confirmation in nine men in whom the α-gal A result was 40% or less. RESULTS: Four men (1.5%; 1.8% of men ≥40 years vs 0% <40 years; all with α-gal A <30%), but no women, were diagnosed with FD. Index cases presented with diffuse but asymmetric LVH, with severe obstruction in one case and frequent high-grade atrioventricular conduction block necessitating a pacemaker in three cases. Family screening identified eight additional cases. Genotyping was performed successfully on DNA extracted from the filter papers. CONCLUSION: In male patients diagnosed as having HCM, pure FD cardiac variants are not exceptional and can be specifically identified using a simple filter-paper test. The sensitivity of this test is low in female patients.",

DESIGN: To examine the efficacy of systematic ECHO alongside the ECG, to identify sudden cardiac death (SCD) disease and to provide a cost-analysis of a government-funded pre-participation screening programme. METHODS: A total 1628 athletes presented for cardiological consultation, ECG, and ECHO as standard, with further cardiac examinations performed if necessary to confirm or exclude pathology. The efficacy of systematic ECHO was compared to an ECG-led programme, with ECHO reserved as a follow-up examination. RESULTS: To screen 1628 athletes with ECG and ECHO cost US$743,996. There were 54 24-h-blood pressure/ECG Holter recordings, 62 exercise tests, 25 CMRs, two electrophysiological studies, and two genetic tests, which cost US$67,734: total US$811,730. Eight athletes (0.5%) were identified with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and two (0.1%) with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The cost per identifed athlete was US$81,173. All 10 athletes presented an abnormal ECG. No athlete diagnosed with HCM was identified by ECHO in isolation. When adopting a ECG-led screening protocol, 15% of athletes required ECHO as a follow-up examination, resulting in a US$380,600 cost reduction (47% saving), with the cost per diagnosis reduced to US$43,113. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes diagnosed with a disease associated with SCD were identified via an abnormal ECG and/or physical examination, personal symptoms, or family history.

The aim of this study was to determine the most accurate diagnostic definition of abnormal Q waves for HCM based on a molecular genetic diagnosis, and also to apply abnormal Q waves to the identification of preclinical carriers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied three different criteria used in previous reports for abnormal Q waves in 148 genotyped subjects. Of the three criteria, Criterion 3 (Q wave >3mm in depth and/or >0.04s in duration in at least two leads except aVR) showed the highest sensitivity (50% in the young, 29% in adults) while retaining a high specificity (90% in the young, 97% in adults), resulting in the highest accuracy (69% in the young, 52% in adults). Using Criterion 3, abnormal Q waves were present 27.6% of preclinical carriers, and in 5.4% of non-carriers (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Criterion 3 may be the most accurate diagnostic definition for HCM. Understanding the diagnostic value of abnormal Q waves may be useful in screening preclinical carriers of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Differences in the diagnostic value of a variety of definitions of negative T waves for HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) have not yet been clarified, resulting in a number of definitions being applied in previous studies. The aim of the present study was to determine the most accurate diagnostic definition of negative T waves for HCM in genotyped populations. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings were analysed in 161 genotyped subjects (97 carriers and 64 non-carriers). We applied three different criteria that have been used in previous studies: Criterion 1, negative T wave >10 mm in depth in any leads; Criterion 2, negative T wave >3 mm in depth in at least two leads; and Criterion 3, negative T wave >1 mm in depth in at least two leads. Of the three criteria, Criterion 3 had the highest sensitivity (43% compared with 5 and 26% in Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 respectively; P<0.0001) and retained a specificity of 95%, resulting in the highest accuracy. In comparison with abnormal Q waves, negative T waves for Criterion 3 had a lower sensitivity in detecting carriers without LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) (12.9% for negative T waves compared with 22.6% for abnormal Q waves). On the other hand, in detecting carriers with LVH, the sensitivity of negative T waves increased in a stepwise direction with the increasing extent of LVH (P<0.001), whereas there was less association between the sensitivity of abnormal Q waves and the extent of LVH. In conclusion, Criterion 3 for negative T waves may be the most accurate definition of HCM based on genetic diagnoses. Negative T waves may show different diagnostic value according to the different criteria and phenotypes in genotyped populations with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is usually caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric or sarcomere-associated cardiac muscle proteins. The disease mainly affects adults, although young children with severe HCM have also been reported. We describe four unrelated neonates with lethal cardiomyopathy, and performed molecular studies to identify the genetic defect. We also present a literature overview of reported patients with compound heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic MYBPC3 mutations and describe their clinical characteristics. All four children presented with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and dyspnea. They died from cardiac failure before age 13 weeks. Features of left ventricular noncompaction were diagnosed in three patients. In the fourth, hypertrabeculation was not a clear feature, but could not be excluded. All of them had septal defects. Two patients were compound heterozygotes for the pathogenic c.2373dup p.(Trp792fs) and c.2827C>T p.(Arg943*) mutations, and two were homozygous for the c.2373dup and c.2827C>T mutations. All patients with biallelic truncating pathogenic mutations in MYBPC3 reported so far (n=21) were diagnosed with severe cardiomyopathy and/or died within the first few months of life. In 62% (13/21), septal defects or a patent ductus arteriosus accompanied cardiomyopathy. In contrast to heterozygous pathogenic mutations, homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating pathogenic MYBPC3 mutations cause severe neonatal cardiomyopathy with features of left ventricular noncompaction and septal defects in approximately 60% of patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in an estimated 0.8 to 6.2 per 100 000 children annually. Screening for cardiac disorders causing SCD in asymptomatic children has public appeal because of its apparent potential to avert tragedy; however, performance of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a screening tool is unknown. We estimated (1) phenotypic (ECG- or echocardiogram [ECHO]-based) prevalence of selected pediatric disorders associated with SCD, and (2) sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of ECG, alone or with ECHO. METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the 3 most common disorders associated with SCD and detectable by ECG. RESULTS: We identified and screened 6954 abstracts, yielding 396 articles, and extracted data from 30. Summary phenotypic prevalences per 100 000 asymptomatic children were 45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10-79) for HCM, 7 (95% CI: 0-14) for LQTS, and 136 (95% CI: 55-218) for Wolff-Parkinson-White. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for ECG were 0.91 for detecting HCM and 0.92 for LQTS. The negative predictive value of detecting either HCM or LQTS by using ECG was high; however, the positive predictive value varied by different sensitivity and specificity cut-points and the true prevalence of the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide an evidence base for evaluating pediatric screening for these disorders. ECG, alone or with ECHO, was a sensitive test for mass screening and negative predictive value was high, but positive predictive value and false-positive rates varied.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the discrimination performance of the 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk-prediction model for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, and China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc) databases for English and Chinese articles validating the risk model. The model's discrimination performance with cutoff points of 4% and 6% based on extracted information was calculated. The extracted C statistic and calculated area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all studies were weighted and summarized. Heterogeneity was quantified through I2 statistics; sensitivity analysis and publication bias were assessed with Egger's test. RESULTS: We included 13 studies validating the model's usefulness. We concluded that the model has excellent specificity, although it has poor sensitivity when setting a recommended cutoff value of 6% for identifying high-risk patients with HCM. In addition, there was moderate discrimination value (global C statistic = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.67-0.83; cutoff point of ≥ 4%; AUC = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.62-0.75; cutoff point of ≥ 6%; AUC = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.59-0.72). Subgroup analysis by region showed slightly weaker predictive ability for North America. There was no significant publication bias (all P > 0.05); sensitivity analysis did not change the results significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The 2014 ESC HCM SCD risk-prediction model has excellent specificity and poor sensitivity and has moderate discrimination performance. In addition, it may have lower prediction value for North America compared with other regions.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Phase-contrast cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) of the coronary sinus has emerged as a non-invasive method for measuring coronary sinus blood flow and coronary flow reserve (CFR). However, its clinical utility has not yet been established. Here we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the clinical value of CMR-derived CFR in various cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: An electronic database search was performed of PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Advanced Search, and EMBASE. We compared the CMR-derived CFR of various cardiovascular diseases (stable coronary artery disease [CAD], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM]) and control subjects. We assessed the prognostic value of CMR-derived CFR for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with stable CAD. RESULTS: A total of 47 eligible studies were identified. The pooled CFR from our meta-analysis was 3.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.98-3.98) in control subjects, 2.50 (95% CI, 2.38-2.61) in stable CAD, 2.01 (95% CI, 1.70-2.32) in cardiomyopathies (HCM and DCM). The meta-analysis showed that CFR was significantly reduced in stable CAD (mean difference [MD] = -1.48; 95% CI, -1.78 to -1.17; p < 0.001; I2 = 0%; p for heterogeneity = 0.33), HCM (MD = -1.20; 95% CI, -1.63 to -0.77; p < 0.001; I2 = 0%; p for heterogeneity = 0.49), and DCM (MD = -1.53; 95% CI, -1.93 to -1.13; p < 0.001; I2 = 0%; p for heterogeneity = 0.45). CMR-derived CFR was an independent predictor of MACE for patients with stable CAD (hazard ratio = 0.52 per unit increase; 95% CI, 0.37-0.73; p < 0.001; I2 = 84%, p for heterogeneity < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CMR-derived CFR was significantly decreased in cardiovascular diseases, and a decreased CFR was associated with a higher occurrence of MACE in patients with stable CAD. These results suggest that CMR-derived CFR has potential for the pathological evaluation of stable CAD, cardiomyopathy, and risk stratification in CAD.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is frequently detected via echocardiography in individuals with Fabry disease (FD), sometimes leading to confusion with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of other aetiologies. Considering this diagnosis challenge, FD should be included in the list of differential diagnosis for patients presenting with LVH. To address this concern, we conducted a prospective screening study in China, using dried blood spot (DBS) testing, to evaluate patients with unexplained LVH. METHODS: Our study was designed as a nationwide, multicentre prospective investigation. A total of 1015 patients from 55 different centres who were diagnosed with LVH by echocardiography were screened in the study from September 2022 to December 2023. Demographic information, biochemistry data, echocardiography parameters and clinical observations were meticulously collected from all participants. The DBS method was used to assess α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in males and both α-Gal A and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) levels in females. RESULTS: The final screening population included 906 patients (589 males, 65%) with LVH, characterized by a mean maximal myocardial thickness of 14.8 ± 4.6 mm and an average age of 56.9 ± 17.2 years. In total, 43 patients (38 males, 5 females) exhibited low α-Gal A activity measurement (<2.2 μmol/L), while 21 patients (10 males, 11 females) presented low α-Gal A activity or elevated lyso-Gb3 levels (>1.1 ng/mL). Among these patients, eight individuals (7 males and 1 female) were genetically confirmed to harbour pathogenic GLA mutations, resulting in a total prevalence of 0.88%. Compared with patients without FD, patients with FD tended to have proteinuria (75% vs. 21.2%, P = 0.001), family history of HCM (37.5% vs. 2.3%, P < 0.01) and neuropathic pain (37.5% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.01) but lower systolic blood pressure (118.5 ± 12.5 vs. 143.3 ± 29.3 mmHg, P = 0.017). Five mutations were previously recognized as associated with FD while the remaining two, p.Asp313Val (c.938A>T) and c.547+3A>G, were deemed potentially pathogenic. Subsequent familial validation post-diagnosis identified an additional 14 confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: This pioneering screening study for FD among Chinese patients with unexplained LVH using DBS measurement, revealed an FD detection rate of 0.88%. Our findings confirmed that the combined measurement of lyso-Gb3 and α-Gal A activity is beneficial for primary screening of FD in patients with LVH. Given the availability of efficacious therapies and the value of cascade screening in extended families, early detection of FD in LVH patients is clinically important.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Post-mortem cardiac magnetic resonance (PMCMR) is an emerging tool supporting forensic medicine for the identification of the causes of cardiac death, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We proposed a new method of PMCMR to diagnose HCM despite myocardial rigor mortis. METHODS: We performed CMR in 49 HCM patients, 30 non-HCM hypertrophy, and 32 healthy controls. In cine images, rigor mortis was simulated by the analysis of the cardiac phase corresponding to 25% of diastole. Left ventricular mass, mean, and standard deviation (SD) of WT, maximal WT, minimal WT, and their difference were compared for the identification of HCM. These parameters were validated at PMCMR, evaluating eight hearts with HCM, 10 with coronary artery disease, and 10 with non-cardiac death. RESULTS: The SD of WT with a cut-off of > 2.4 had the highest accuracy to identify HCM (AUC 0.95, 95% CI = 0.89-0.98). This was particularly evident in the female population of HCM (AUC=0.998), with 100% specificity (95% CI = 85-100%) and 96% sensitivity (95% CI = 79-99%). Using this parameter, at PMCMR, all of the eight patients with HCM were correctly identified with no false positives. CONCLUSIONS: PMCMR allows identification of HCM as the cause of sudden death using the SD of WT > 2.4 as the diagnostic parameter.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Fabry disease (FD) in Chinese patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of FD in Chinese patients with HCM. METHODS: Of 217 patients with HCM, FD probands were screened by next-generation sequencing at Fuwai Hospital. Medical data from α-galactosidase A activity, electrocardiography, echocardiography, coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, pathological examination, and follow up was analyzed. RESULTS: Two FD probands were observed (0.93% of patients with HCM), both of which were diagnosed with symptomatic obstructive HCM at 49 years of age. One proband had a GLA mutation (c.887T>C [p.M296T]) with a late-onset cardiac variant, which was characterized by dual ventricular hypertrophy and conduction disease with a permanent pacemaker. The other patient had a GLA mutation (c.758T>C [p.I253T]) with a classic phenotype and dual ventricular hypertrophy, atrioventricular block, renal failure, and recurrent cerebral infarction. Both probands had late gadolinium enhancement mainly in the basal segment of the inferolateral wall. Follow up revealed no exertional symptoms or outflow obstruction after surgical septal myectomy in the two probands, and stable renal function was observed after 6 months of migalastat therapy in the later one. A family study revealed six female carriers and three sudden cardiac deaths. CONCLUSIONS: FD is not uncommon in Chinese patients with HCM. Multiple organic involvement, dual ventricular hypertrophy, and conduction disease provide clinical clues for suspected FD, and early genetic screening is necessary. Surgical septal myectomy and migalastat improve the long-term prognosis of patients with FD.",

However, it is uncertain whether the use of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) represents a more effective approach for diagnosis of cases with HCM and DCM. In this study, we performed indirect comparisons of the coverage and diagnostic yield of WES on genes and variants related to HCM and DCM versus 4 different commercial gene panels using 40 HCM and DCM patients, assuming perfect coverage in those panels. We identified 6 pathogenic or likely pathogenic among 14 HCM patients (diagnostic yield 43%). 3 pathogenic or likely pathogenic were found among the 26 DCM patients (diagnostic yield 12%). The coverage was similar to that of four existing commercial gene panels due to the clustering of mutation within MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNT2, and TTN. Moreover, the coverage of WES appeared inadequate for TNNI3 and PLN. We conclude that most of the pathogenic variants for HCM and DCM can be found within a small number of genes which were covered by all the commercial gene panels, and the application of WES did not increase diagnostic yield.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is defined as LVH in the absence of myocyte disarray or secondary causes. It is unclear whether idiopathic LVH represents the phenotypic spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or whether it is a unique disease entity. We aimed to ascertain the prevalence of HCM in first-degree relatives of decedents from sudden death with idiopathic LVH at autopsy. Decedents also underwent molecular autopsy to identify the presence of pathogenic variants in genes implicated in HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Families of 46 decedents with idiopathic LVH (125 first-degree relatives) were investigated with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram exercise tolerance test, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, 24-h Holter, and ajmaline provocation test. Next-generation sequencing molecular autopsy was performed in 14 (30%) cases. Decedents with idiopathic LVH were aged 33 ± 14 years and 40 (87%) were male. Fourteen families (30%) comprising 16 individuals were diagnosed with cardiac disease, including Brugada syndrome (n = 8), long QT syndrome (n = 3), cardiomyopathy (n = 2), and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (n = 1). None of the family members were diagnosed with HCM. Molecular autopsy did not identify any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. Two decedents had pathogenic variants associated with long QT syndrome, which were confirmed in relatives with the clinical phenotype. One decedent had a pathogenic variant associated with Danon disease in the absence of any histopathological findings of the condition or clinical phenotype in the family. CONCLUSION: Idiopathic LVH appears to be a distinct disease entity from HCM and is associated with fatal arrhythmias in individuals with primary arrhythmia syndromes. Family screening in relatives of decedents with idiopathic LVH should be comprehensive and encompass the broader spectrum of inherited cardiac conditions, including channelopathies.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between a fragmented QRS complex (fQRS) on 12-lead ECG and fatal arrhythmic events in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether fQRS is associated with ventricular arrhythmic events (VAEs) in HCM patients. METHODS: Of an initial cohort of 273 patients (57% male, mean age 55 years) diagnosed with HCM, 167 patients were included and divided into 2 groups: those with fQRS (n = 67) and those without fQRS (n = 100). fQRS was defined as notching of the R or S wave in 2 contiguous leads. VAEs were defined as nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Major arrhythmic events (MAEs) were sustained VT or SCD. RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 6.3 years, univariate analysis showed that fQRS was significantly associated with increased VAEs (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 6.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.46-15.49, P < .001) and MAEs (unadjusted HR 5.12, 95% CI 1.38-19.01, P = .014). Multivariate analysis revealed that fQRS was a strong independent predictor of VAEs (adjusted HR 6.28, 95% CI 2.49-15.84, P < .001) and MAEs (adjusted HR 6.04, 95% CI 1.49-24.39, P = .011). fQRS in the inferior leads was most closely related to MAEs compared to fQRS in other myocardial territories, and its inclusion in a risk calculator for mortality in HCM patients increased the positive predictive value from 8% to 25% in low-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Presence of an fQRS may be a good candidate marker for prediction of VAE in patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death among young athletes. Differentiating between physiologically adaptive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy observed in athletes' hearts and pathological HCM remains challenging. By quantifying the diffusion of water molecules, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI allows voxelwise characterization of myocardial microstructure. PURPOSE: To explore microstructural differences between healthy volunteers, athletes, and HCM patients using DTI. STUDY TYPE: Prospective cohort. POPULATION: Twenty healthy volunteers, 20 athletes, and 20 HCM patients. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T/DTI spin echo. ASSESSMENT: In-house MatLab software was used to derive mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) as markers of amplitude and anisotropy of the diffusion of water molecules, and secondary eigenvector angles (E2A)-reflecting the orientations of laminar sheetlets. STATISTICAL TESTS: Independent samples t-tests were used to detect statistical significance between any two cohorts. Analysis of variance was utilized for detecting the statistical difference between the three cohorts. Statistical tests were two-tailed. A result was considered statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: DTI markers were significantly different between HCM, athletes, and volunteers. HCM patients had significantly higher global MD and E2A, and significantly lower FA than athletes and volunteers. (MDHCM = 1.52 ± 0.06 × 10-3 mm2 /s, MDAthletes = 1.49 ± 0.03 × 10-3 mm2 /s, MDvolunteers = 1.47 ± 0.02 × 10-3 mm2 /s, P < 0.05; E2AHCM = 58.8 ± 4°, E2Aathletes = 47 ± 5°, E2Avolunteers = 38.5 ± 7°, P < 0.05; FAHCM = 0.30 ± 0.02, FAAthletes = 0.35 ± 0.02, FAvolunteers = 0.36 ± 0.03, P < 0.05). HCM patients had significantly higher E2A in their thickest segments compared to the remote (E2Athickest = 66.8 ± 7, E2Aremote = 51.2 ± 9, P < 0.05). DATA CONCLUSION: DTI depicts an increase in amplitude and isotropy of diffusion in the myocardium of HCM compared to athletes and volunteers as reflected by increased MD and decreased FA values. While significantly higher E2A values in HCM and athletes reflect steeper configurations of the myocardial sheetlets than in volunteers, HCM patients demonstrated an eccentric rise in E2A in their thickest segments, while athletes demonstrated a concentric rise. Further studies are required to determine the diagnostic capabilities of DTI. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) sometimes develop subendocardial ischemia (SEI) in the left ventricle (LV). In the present study it was examined whether volumetric variables obtained by gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are useful in detecting exercise-induced SEI in patients with HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Exercise 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 26 HCM patients having non-obstruction and mild hypertrophy with a ventricular septal thickness < or = 20 mm. SEI was quantified using software developed previously, and the results were correlated with volumetric variables obtained using Quantitative Gated SPECT software. Exercise-induced percentage change in LV end-systolic volume was higher in 9 HCM patients with SEI (25.8+/-3.1%) than in 17 patients without (10.0+/-2.5%, p=0.009), although the percentage change in LV end-diastolic volume was similar in the 2 groups. The receiver-operator characteristics curve of the percentage changes in LV end-systolic volume for the detection of SEI showed that the optimal cutoff was 17%. This cutoff point yielded a good diagnostic value for the presence of SEI with a sensitivity of 89%, specificity 82%, and likelihood ratio 5.04. CONCLUSIONS: Gated SPECT technique is useful in detecting SEI during exercise in a select population of HCM patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "In this study, we investigated the association between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and tissue Doppler imaging measurements and also screening for deadly mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We enrolled 20 patients diagnosed with HCM (age:10.7±5 years (1-17), 85% male, weight:42.25±23.10 kg, height:141.80±32.45 cm) and 20 age, gender and body weight-matched control subjects. We performed electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and tissue Doppler echocardiography in each group, as well as genetic tests (for Arg403Gln, Arg453Cys, Arg719Trp and Arg719Gln mutations in MYH7 Exons 13, 14, 19) and BNP in the patients. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (Group 1) or absence (Group 2) of left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction. QTc dispersion and the LV ejection fraction and left atrial (LA) volume index were increased in Group 1. The LA volume index and the mitral and septal E/Ea ratio and septum Z-score were increased while the mitral lateral annulus and septal annulus Ea wave velocities and the mitral and tricuspid E/A ratio were decreased in patients with high levels of BNP compared to those with normal BNP levels. There were no mutations that are associated with increased risk of sudden death found in patients included in this study. In the light of our data, we conclude that such parameters BNP levels above the 98 pg/mL, septal thickness Z-score ˃6, and higher mitral and septal E/Ea ratios can be used for management of patients with HCM according to life-threatening conditions.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent myocardial ischemia has been recognized as playing an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), with or without gadolinium, is a promising method of evaluating fibrosis, edema and hypoperfusion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interrelationship between late enhancement (LE) and other signs of ischemia, such as edema and perfusion defects, and to relate them to clinical data in order to describe the stage of the disease. METHODS: Forty-four patients were evaluated by CMR cine images, T2-weighted sequences for edema and LE sequences. First-pass perfusion study was obtained in 37 patients. Acute-subacute ischemic events were clinically defined as the presence of chest pain or new onset of ST-segment depression, end-stage phase by left ventricular ejection fraction <50% and maximal left ventricular wall thickness <25 mm. RESULTS: Intramural patchy LE was found in 35/44 (80%) patients; extensive LE in 4/44 (9%). Edema was present in 24/44 (54%) patients and perfusion defects in 17/37 (46%). Simultaneous presence of patchy LE, edema and hypoperfusion in corresponding segments, was significantly associated to acute-subacute ischemic-phase parameters (p=0.02; RR 1.99, 95% C.I. 0.77-5.02). Extensive LE and perfusion defects in the absence of edema were significantly related to end-stage HCM (p<0.001; RR 13.7, 95% C.I. 1.83-102.05). CONCLUSIONS: Using CMR in patients with HCM, we found focal tissue abnormalities consistent with regional ischemia at various stages. CMR provides important, clinically relevant information on the acuity, extent and functional relevance of ischemic injuries in HCM.",

The present study aims to analyze proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, DNA content and apoptosis, in several types of myocardial hypertrophy in order to define the biological characteristics of this process. METHODS: The biological parameters were investigated in normal hearts (n=4) and in 21 cases of left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy related to pressure overload (n=7), post-infarction remodeling (n=8) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (n=8). RESULTS: The analyzed biomarkers were similar in hypertension and in remodeling, with a very high apoptotic index (mean values: 8.1 and 8.5%, respectively), a low PCNA positivity (mean values: 1.8 and 1.6%) and a prevalent diploid DNA content (DNA index: 1.2). Conversely, HCM showed a high mean PCNA index (21.2%) associated with a prevalence of hyperdiploid myocytes (DNA index: 1.8) and a low number of apoptotic cells (mean value: 1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant biological differences between hypertrophy in HCM and that related to arterial hypertension and post-infarction remodeling. Therefore, the combined evaluation of DNA content, PCNA and apoptotic indices could provide a powerful diagnostic tool in doubtful cases of myocardial primary or secondary hypertrophy and open new avenues in the clinical treatment of these entities.",

        "Abstract Note": "Objective: Given the psychosocial and ethical burden, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMs) could benefit from the establishment of genetic probability prior to the test. This study aimed to develop a simple tool to provide genotype prediction for HCMs.Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was built with the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) of 124 HCMs who underwent genetic testing (GT), externally tested by predicting the genotype on another HCMs cohort (n = 54), and compared with the conventional methods (the Mayo and Toronto score). Using a third cohort of HCMs (n = 76), the role of the network in risk stratification was explored by calculating the sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk scorers (HCM risk-SCD) across the predicted genotypes. Score-CAM was employed to provide a visual explanation of the network.Results: Overall, 80 of 178 HCMs (45%) were genotype-positive. Using the 12-lead ECG as input, the network showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96) on the test set, outperforming the Mayo score (0.69 [95% CI, 0.65-0.78], p < 0.001) and the Toronto score (0.69 [95% CI, 0.64-0.75], p < 0.001). The network classified the third cohort into two groups (predicted genotype-negative vs. predicted genotype-positive). Compared with the former, patients predicted genotype-positive had a significantly higher HCM risk-SCD (0.04 ± 0.03 vs. 0.03 ± 0.02, p <0.01). Visualization indicated that the prediction was heavily influenced by the limb lead.Conclusions: The network demonstrated a promising ability in genotype prediction and risk assessment in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Diastolic dysfunction plays a major role in precipitating congestive heart failure in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In many such patients, symptoms are unmasked only during exercise because left ventricular (LV) filling pressure is normal at rest but increase with exercise. We sought to establish whether abnormal postexercise diastolic parameters are associated with reduced exercise capacity in patients with HCM. We examined 590 patients with asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic HCM (age 54 ± 14 years, 57% men, body mass index 30 ± 6 kg/m2, 84% on β blockers) with HCM by 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography at rest and after maximal treadmill exercise echocardiography (TSE). A complete echocardiogram (including LV ejection fraction, LV thickness, LV outflow tract [LVOT] gradient, degree of mitral regurgitation) was recorded. Diastolic parameters (septal and lateral [e'] velocities of the mitral annulus, peak early [E] and late [A] mitral inflow velocity, E/A ratio, E/e', right ventricular systolic pressure [RVSP], and left atrial volume index) were recorded at rest and after TSE. Exercise functional capacity was recorded and divided into <85% or >85% of age-gender predicted metabolic equivalents (AGP-METs). After maximal exercise, 32% patients had at least moderate mitral regurgitation, mean LVOT gradient was 61 ± 59 mm Hg, E/A ratio was 1.2 ± 1.0, average E/e' ratio 12.9 ± 1.0, and peak RVSP was 36 ± 15 mm Hg. Only 42% of patients achieved >85% of AGP-METs; the mean METs was 7 ± 3. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.05), β-blocker use (OR 2.58), higher left atrial volume index (OR 1.02), higher peak stress LVOT gradient (LVOTG) (OR 1.06), peak stress E/e' (OR 1.04), and higher RVSP (OR 1.03) were independently associated with <85% AGP-METs achieved (all p <0.05). In conclusion, in patients with asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic HCM who underwent TSE, there is a significant and independent association between abnormal diastolic response to exercise and reduced exercise capacity in HCM. Incorporating diastolic parameters during stress echocardiography could provide incremental diagnostic utility in deciphering the exact etiology of dyspnea in such patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined clinically by pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. We have previously developed a plasma proteomics biomarker panel that correlates with clinical markers of disease severity and sudden cardiac death risk in adult patients with HCM. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of adult biomarkers and perform new discoveries in proteomics for childhood-onset HCM. METHODS: Fifty-nine protein biomarkers were identified from an exploratory plasma proteomics screen in children with HCM and augmented into our existing multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography-tandem/mass spectrometry-based assay. The association of these biomarkers with clinical phenotypes and outcomes was prospectively tested in plasma collected from 148 children with HCM and 50 healthy controls. Machine learning techniques were used to develop novel pediatric plasma proteomic biomarker panels. RESULTS: Four previously identified adult HCM markers (aldolase fructose-bisphosphate A, complement C3a, talin-1, and thrombospondin 1) and 3 new markers (glycogen phosphorylase B, lipoprotein a and profilin 1) were elevated in pediatric HCM. Using supervised machine learning applied to training (n=137) and validation cohorts (n=61), this 7-biomarker panel differentiated HCM from healthy controls with an area under the curve of 1.0 in the training data set (sensitivity 100% [95% CI, 95-100]; specificity 100% [95% CI, 96-100]) and 0.82 in the validation data set (sensitivity 75% [95% CI, 59-86]; specificity 88% [95% CI, 75-94]). Reduced circulating levels of 4 other peptides (apolipoprotein L1, complement 5b, immunoglobulin heavy constant epsilon, and serum amyloid A4) found in children with high sudden cardiac death risk provided complete separation from the low and intermediate risk groups and predicted mortality and adverse arrhythmic outcomes (hazard ratio, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.0-4.2]; P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: In children, a 7-biomarker proteomics panel can distinguish HCM from controls with high sensitivity and specificity, and another 4-biomarker panel identifies those at high risk of adverse arrhythmic outcomes, including sudden cardiac death.",

It is characterized by apical obliteration and persistent diastolic contraction, often resulting in microvascular ischaemia. We report five cases of ApHCM, with evidence of intramyocardial calcification on echocardiogram. On cardiac magnetic imaging (MRI), a hypointense component at early gadolinium enhancement (EGE) sequences, compatible with calcium, and a deep layer, with hyperintensity at late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences, referable to fibrosis, suggest an endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) diagnosis. EMF pathologic hallmark is endocardium and myocardium scarring, evolving to dystrophic calcification. It is found only in few ApHCM patients. Our series is the largest one described until now. Analysing patients' history, coexistent inflammatory triggers were evident in all of them, so their co-morbidities could represent a further cause of small vessel disease, in the context of ischaemic microvascular stress due to hypertrophy, leading to fibrosis and dystrophic calcification. This series could demonstrate the relation between apical fibrosis/calcification and microvascular ischaemia due to hypertrophy and inflammatory triggers.",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of new HCM diagnosis in SP mutation carriers. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of adult and pediatric SP mutation carriers identified during family screening who did not fulfill diagnostic criteria for HCM at first evaluation. RESULTS: The authors evaluated 285 individuals from 156 families (median age 14.2 years [interquartile range: 6.8 to 31.6 years], 141 [49.5%] male individuals); 145 (50.9%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Frequency of causal genes was as follows: MYBPC3 n = 123 (43.2%), MYH7 n = 69 (24.2%), TNNI3 n = 39 (13.7%), TNNT2 n = 34 (11.9%), TPM1 n = 9 (3.2%), MYL2 n = 6 (2.1%), ACTC1 n = 1 (0.4%), multiple mutations n = 4 (1.4%). Median follow-up was 8.0 years (interquartile range: 4.0 to 13.3 years) and 86 (30.2%) patients developed HCM; 16 of 50 (32.0%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria on CMR but not echocardiography. Estimated HCM penetrance at 15 years of follow-up was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38% to 54%). In a multivariable model adjusted for age and stratified for CMR, independent predictors of HCM development were male sex (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.82 to 4.65) and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) (HR: 4.02; 95% CI: 2.51 to 6.44); TNNI3 variants had the lowest risk (HR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.55, compared to MYBPC3). CONCLUSIONS: Following a first negative screening, approximately 50% of SP mutation carriers develop HCM over 15 years of follow-up. Male sex and an abnormal ECG are associated with a higher risk of developing HCM. Regular CMR should be considered in long-term screening.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a genetically and clinically heterogeneous cardiomyopathy, is commonly caused by mutations in the MYBPC3 gene or other various sarcomeric genes. HCM patients carrying sarcomeric gene mutations may experience an asymptomatic period at early stage but still possess an escalating risk of developing adverse cardiac events including sudden cardiac death. It is crucial to determine the phenotypic and pathogenic effects of mutations in sarcomeric genes. In this study, a 65-year-old male was admitted with a history of chest pain, dyspnoea, and syncope and with a family history of HCM and sudden cardiac death. On admission, electrocardiogram indicated atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction (48%), which were ascertained by cardiovascular magnetic resonance. With late gadolinium-enhancement imaging, cardiovascular magnetic resonance found myocardial fibrosis on left ventricular wall. The exercise stress echocardiography test showed non-obstructive myocardial changes. Whole-exome sequencing analysis identified a MYBPC3 gene heterozygous nonsense variant (c.1522C>T) in the patient and one of his healthy grandnieces (18-year-old). The patient was diagnosed with non-obstructive HCM, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and so on. Medications, ICD implantation, and catheter ablation were chosen to maintain heart function. Our study provides the clinical evidence regarding the HCM pathogenicity of MYBPC3 c.1522C>T variant and highlights the significance of family genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The right ventricle (RV) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) tends to be neglected, as previous efforts have predominantly focused on examining the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) abnormalities. The objectives of this study were to assess RV function in HCM, changes over time, and association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety HCM patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 55%) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). All patients were followed up for clinical events for a median duration of 4.4 years. Sixty-three patients had a follow-up CMR undertaken at a median interval of 5.4 years. Main study measures and outcomes were RV function (RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and RV strain) at baseline, temporal changes in RV function over time and prognostic value of RV dysfunction for predicting cardiovascular outcomes in HCM. RESULTS: When compared to controls, HCM patients exhibited lower RV and LV peak global longitudinal systolic strains on feature-tracking analysis of cine images, while RVEF and LVEF were within the normal range. On follow-up CMR, both RV and LV strain parameters decreased over time. RVEF decreased at follow-up (65 ± 7% to 62 ± 7%, P < 0.001) but the change in LVEF was not significant (68 ± 10% to 66 ± 8%, P = 0.30). On clinical follow up, reduced RVEF was an independent predictor of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) [HR 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.15), P < 0.001] and composite cardiovascular events (NSVT, stroke, heart failure hospitalisation and cardiovascular death) [HR 1.07 (95% CI 1.03-1.10), P < 0.001]. RV longitudinal strain was an independent predictor of NSVT [HR 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09), P = 0.029]. Patients with RVEF < 55% showed an increased risk of NSVT and composite cardiovascular events. In contrast, LVEF and LV global longitudinal strain were not predictive of such events on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, RV function, including RV strain, and LV strain decrease over time despite preserved LVEF. Reduction in RV but not LV function is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Assessing RV function in early HCM disease might have a role in risk stratification to prevent future cardiovascular events.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients are at risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). We aimed to explore whether systolic function by strain echocardiography is related to VAs and to the extent of fibrosis by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 150 HCM patients and 50 healthy individuals. VAs were defined as non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia and aborted cardiac arrest. Left ventricular function was assessed by ejection fraction (EF) and by global longitudinal strain (GLS) assessed by speckle tracking echocardiography. Mechanical dispersion was calculated as standard deviation (SD) of time from Q/R on ECG to peak longitudinal strain in 16 left ventricular segments. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was assessed by CMR. HCM patients had similar EF (61 ± 5% vs. 61 ± 8%, P = 0.77), but worse GLS (-15.7 ± 3.6% vs. -21.1 ± 1.9%, P < 0.001) and more pronounced mechanical dispersion (64 ± 22 vs. 36 ± 13 ms, P < 0.001) compared with healthy individuals. VAs were documented in 37 (25%) HCM patients. Patients with VAs had worse GLS (-14.1 ± 3.6% vs. -16.3 ± 3.4%, P < 0.01), more pronounced mechanical dispersion (79 ± 27 vs. 59 ± 16 ms, P < 0.001), and higher %LGE (6.1 ± 7.8% vs. 0.5 ± 1.4%, P < 0.001) than patients without VAs. Mechanical dispersion correlated with %LGE (R = 0.52, P < 0.001) and was independently associated with VAs (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3, P = 0.02) and improved risk stratification for VAs. CONCLUSION: GLS, mechanical dispersion, and LGE were markers of VAs in HCM patients. Mechanical dispersion was a strong independent predictor of VAs and related to the extent of fibrosis. Strain echocardiography may improve risk stratification of VAs in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients often develop left--ventricular subendocardial ischaemia, a cause of chest symptoms, despite normal epicardial coronary arteries. The aim of this study was to examine whether ultrasonic tissue characterization or late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can detect subendocardial ischaemia in patients with HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subendocardial ischaemia was quantified on exercise Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy in 29 non-obstructive HCM patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy. Ultrasonic tissue characterization using cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (CV-IB) and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were analysed separately in the right halves and the left halves of the ventricular septum in relation to subendocardial ischaemia. Subendocardial ischaemia was identified in 17 (59%) patients. The ratio of CV-IB in the right-to-left halves of the ventricular septum was significantly higher in patients with subendocardial ischaemia (1.19 ± 0.10) than those without (0.84 ± 0.10, P = 0.04). The optimal cutoff for the detection of subendocardial ischaemia was the ratio of CV-IB >1.0, with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 71%, and accuracy of 76%. On the other hand, late gadolinium enhancement was not associated with subendocardial ischaemia in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonic tissue characterization using CV-IB separately in the right and left halves of the ventricular septum, but not late gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging, provided useful information in detecting subendocardial ischaemia in patients with HCM. Ultrasonic tissue characterization may be useful in selecting patients who will benefit from medications to relieve chest symptoms.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a comprehensive genetic testing approach that reports most types of nucleotide variants. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess WGS for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in which prior genetic testing did not establish a molecular diagnosis, and as a first-line genetic test. METHODS: WGS was performed on 58 unrelated patients with HCM, 14 affected family members, and 2 unaffected parents of a severely affected proband. The authors searched for nucleotide variants in coding regions of 184 candidate cardiac hypertrophy genes. They also searched for nucleotide variants in deep intronic regions that alter RNA splicing, large genomic rearrangements, and mitochondrial genome variants. RNA analysis was performed to validate splice-altering variants. RESULTS: The authors found a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 9 of 46 families (20%) for which prior genetic testing was inconclusive. Three families had variants in genes not included in prior genetic testing. One family had a pathogenic variant that was filtered out with prior exome sequencing. Five families had pathogenic variants in noncoding regions, including 4 with deep intronic variants that activate novel splicing, and 1 mitochondrial genome variant. As a first-line genetic test, WGS identified a pathogenic variant in 5 of 12 families (42%) that had never received prior genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: WGS identified additional genetic causes of HCM over targeted gene sequencing approaches. Extending genetic screening to deep intronic regions identified pathogenic variants in 9% of gene-elusive HCM. These findings translate to more accurate diagnosis and management in HCM families.",

The aim of this study was to assess diastolic LV unstrain and untwist. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one consecutive genotyped family members of HCM patients (mean age 37 ± 11 years, 16 men) and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure untwist and unstrain. No significant differences between G+/LVH- and control subjects were seen in maximal systolic twist and global longitudinal strain. In diastole, the early peak untwist rate was significantly lower in G+/LVH- subjects compared with control subjects (62 ± 19°s - 1 vs. 76 ± 30°s - 1, P <0.05), whereas the late peak untwist rate tended to be higher. Untwist from maximal twist until the first 20% of diastole was delayed in G+/LVH- subjects (39.3 ± 12.9% vs. 51.3 ± 15.6%, P <0.005). Late diastolic unstrain rate was significantly higher in G+/LVH- subjects in the inferoseptal wall (111 ± 33 s - 1 vs. 94 ± 32 s - 1, P = 0.024), the inferolateral wall (105 ± 42 vs. 75 ± 35 s - 1, P = 0.007) and the anteroseptal wall (97 ± 26 vs. 80 ± 23 s - 1, P = 0.010). Unstrain from maximal twist until the first 20% of diastole was delayed in G+/LVH- subjects in the inferoseptal (18.9 ± 14.0% vs. 30.1 ± 17.7%, P = 0.005), inferolateral (27.1 ± 16.3% vs. 39.2 ± 18.0%, P = 0.015) and anteroseptal (19.1 ± 14.7% vs. 35.8 ± 18.5%, P = 0.0003) segments.

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Standard-of-care (SoC) medications for the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) are recommended as first-line therapy despite the lack of evidence from controlled clinical trials and well known off-target side effects. OBJECTIVES: We describe the impact of SoC therapy downtitration and withdrawal in patients already receiving aficamten in FOREST-HCM (Follow-Up, Open-Label, Research Evaluation of Sustained Treatment with Aficamten in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; NCT04848506). METHODS: Patients receiving SoC therapy (beta-blocker, nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, and/or disopyramide) were eligible for protocol-guided SoC downtitration and withdrawal at the discretion of the investigator and after achieving a stable dose of aficamten for ≥4 weeks. Successful SoC withdrawal was defined as at least a 50% dose-reduction in ≥1 medication. Adverse events (AEs) were prospectively evaluated 1 to 2 weeks after any SoC withdrawal. RESULTS: Of 145 patients with oHCM who were followed for at least 24 weeks (mean age 60.5 ± 13.2 years; 44.8% female; 42% NYHA functional class III), 136 (93.8%) were receiving ≥1 SoC therapy; of those, 64 (47%) had an attempt at withdrawal, with 59 (92.2%) successful. Thirty-eight (64.4%) patients completely discontinued ≥1 medication, and 27 (45.8%) achieved aficamten monotherapy with 2 later restarting a SoC medication. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics on day 1 in FOREST-HCM in those with a SoC-withdrawal vs no-withdrawal attempt. In patients who underwent successful SoC therapy withdrawal, NYHA functional class improved by ≥1 class in 79.2% from baseline, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score improved to 83.0 ± 15.8 points, and resting and Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract gradient improved to 14.3 ± 10.9 and 32.9 ± 21.4 mm Hg, respectively. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels improved to a median of 220.0 pg/mL (Q1-Q3: 102.0-554.0.0 pg/mL) and high-sensitivity troponin I improved to a median of 6.0 ng/L (Q1-Q3:3.5-10.7 ng/L). Downtitration and withdrawal of SoC therapy did not impact these results (all P values for change were >0.05), and these changes were similar in patients who did not undergo SoC therapy withdrawal. There were no serious AEs attributed to SoC withdrawal and treatment emergent AEs were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In FOREST-HCM, one-half of the patients with oHCM attempted downtitration and withdrawal of SoC medications while receiving aficamten treatment, with infrequent instances of resumption of SoC. Stopping and dose reduction of SoC medications were well tolerated with no adverse consequences in clinical measures of efficacy (Follow-Up, Open-Label, Research Evaluation of Sustained Treatment with Aficamten in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [FOREST-HCM]; NCT04848506).",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: End-stage (ES) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been considered a particularly grim and unfavorable disease complication, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, frequently requiring heart transplant. Previous reports have included small numbers of patients with relatively short follow-up, predominantly in prior treatment eras. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate clinical profile and prognosis for end-stage heart failure in a large HCM cohort with contemporary management strategies. METHODS: Patients at Tufts HCM Institute, from 2004 to 2017, were identified with ES and systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] <50%), followed for 5.8 ± 4.7 years (up to 18 years). RESULTS: Of the 2,447 patients, 118 (4.8%) had ES-HCM (EF 39 ± 9%; range 12% to 49%) at age 48 ± 15 years. Notably, over follow-up, 57 patients (48%) achieved clinical stability in New York Heart Association functional classes I/II with medical treatment (or cardiac resynchronization therapy), including 6 patients ≥10 years from ES diagnosis (up to 14 years). In total, 61 other patients (52%) developed refractory heart failure to disabling New York Heart Association functional classes III/IV (5.2%/year); 67% have survived, including 31 with heart transplant. Of the 118 ES patients, 21 had appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy terminating potentially lethal tachyarrhythmias, with no difference in frequency of events in patients with EF 35% to 49% versus EF <35% (17% vs. 19%; p = 0.80). With all available treatment modalities, ES-related mortality was 1.9%/year, with 10-year survival of 85% (95% confidence interval: 77% to 94%). Mortality was 4-fold lower than previously reported for ES (8.0%/year), but exceeded 10-fold HCM with preserved EF (0.2%/year; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although ES remains an important complication of HCM, contemporary treatment strategies, including ICDs and heart transplant, are associated with significantly lower mortality than previously considered. Primary prevention ICDs should be considered when EF is <50% in HCM. Rapid heart failure progression is not an inevitable consequence of ES, and some patients experience extended periods of clinical stability.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare long-term outcomes after myectomy and alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: Surgical myectomy and ASA are both accepted treatment options for medical therapy-resistant obstructive HCM. Previous meta-analyses only evaluated short-term outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted for eligible studies with a follow-up of at least 3 years. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and (aborted) sudden cardiac death (SCD). Secondary outcomes were periprocedural complications, left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and New York Heart Association functional class after ≥3 months, and reintervention. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Sixteen myectomy cohorts (n = 2,791; mean follow-up, 7.4 years) and 11 ASA cohorts (n = 2,013; mean follow-up, 6.2 years) were included. Long-term mortality was found to be similarly low after ASA (1.5% per year) compared with myectomy (1.4% per year, p = 0.78). The rate of (aborted) SCD, including appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks, was 0.4% per year after ASA and 0.5% per year after myectomy (p = 0.47). Permanent pacemaker implantation was performed after ASA in 10% of the patients compared with 4.4% after myectomy (p < 0.001). Reintervention was performed in 7.7% of the patients who underwent ASA compared with 1.6% after myectomy (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term mortality and (aborted) SCD rates after ASA and myectomy are similarly low. Patients who undergo ASA have more than twice the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation and a 5 times higher risk of the need for additional septal reduction therapy compared with those who undergo myectomy.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: High-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are identified by contemporary risk stratification and effectively treated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). However, long-term HCM clinical course after ICD therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias is incompletely understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cohort of 486 high-risk HCM patients with ICDs was assembled from 8 international centers. Clinical course and device interventions were addressed, and survey questionnaires assessed patient anxiety level and psychological well-being related to ICD therapy. Of 486 patients, 94 (19%) experienced appropriate ICD interventions terminating ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, 3.7% per year for primary prevention, over 6.4±4.7 years. Of 94 patients, 87 were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic at the time of appropriate ICD interventions; 74 of these 87 (85%) remained in classes I/II without significant change in clinical status over the subsequent 5.9±4.9 years (up to 22). Among the 94 patients, there was one sudden death (caused by device failure; 1.1%); 3 patients died from other HCM-related processes unrelated to arrhythmic risk (eg, end-stage heart failure). Post-ICD intervention, freedom from HCM mortality was 100%, 97%, and 92% at 1, 5, and 10 years, distinctly lower than in ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy ICD trials. HCM patients with ICD interventions reported heightened anxiety in expectation of future shocks, but with intact general psychological well-being and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, unlike ischemic heart disease, prevention of sudden death with ICD therapy is unassociated with significant increase in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality, or transformation to heart failure deterioration. ICD therapy does not substantially impair overall psychological and physical well-being.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the characteristics and results of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and left ventricular apical aneurysm (AA). BACKGROUND: Monomorphic VT in patients with HCM and left ventricular AA has been reported. However, outcome data of RFCA are insufficient. METHODS: Fifteen patients with HCM and AA who underwent RFCA for VT at 5 different institutions were included in this study. The data were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Endocardial voltage mapping showed a low-voltage area (LVA), and late potential in the AA was recorded in 12 patients (80%). Although epicardial or intramural origin of VT was suspected in 7 patients, endocardial RFCA successfully suppressed the VT at the LVA border (n = 10) or within the LVA (n = 2). In 2 of 3 patients without LVA at the endocardial site, linear RFCA at the anterior wall of the aneurysmal neck side was successful. In the remaining patient, endocardial RFCA of AA was not effective, and epicardial RFCA site was needed. In all patients, clinical VT became noninducible after RFCA. VT recurrence was observed in 2 patients (13.3%) during the 12-month follow-up period. One patient underwent a second endocardial RFCA, and no VT recurrence was noted. In the other patient, VT recurred 3 months after RFCA and was successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM and AA, endocardial RFCA of AA effectively suppressed monomorphic VT which was related to AA and resulted in satisfactory outcomes.",

In this study, we aimed to synthesize all available evidence on the effectiveness of ablation of AF in patients with HCM compared to those without HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically reviewed bibliographic databases to identify studies published through February 2023. We included cohort studies with available quantitative information on rates of recurrent atrial arrhythmias, anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy, and repeat ablation procedures after initial AF ablation in patients with vs without HCM. Estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analysis models and reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eight studies were included in quantitative synthesis (262 HCM and 642 non-HCM patients). During median follow-up 13-54 months across studies, AF recurrence rates ranged from 13.3% to 92.9% in HCM and 7.6% to 58.8% in non-HCM patients. The pooled RR for recurrent atrial arrhythmia after the first AF ablation in HCM patients compared to non-HCM controls was 1.498 (95% CI = 1.305-1.720; P < 0.001). During follow-up, HCM patients more often required AAD therapy (RR = 2.844; 95% CI = 1.713-4.856; P < 0.001) and repeat AF ablation (RR = 1.544; 95% CI = 1.070-2.228; P = 0.02). The pooled RR for recurrent atrial arrhythmias after the last AF ablation was higher in patients with HCM than those without HCM (RR = 1.607; 95% CI = 1.235-2.090; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-HCM patients, those with HCM had higher rates of recurrent atrial arrhythmias, AAD use, and need for repeat AF ablation after initial ablation of AF.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Over the past decade, catheter ablation (CA) has become an established therapy for symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, and restoring sinus rhythm is of great clinical benefit to them. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CA for AF in patients with HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six databases were searched to identify studies describing outcomes of CA of AF in HCM patients with a mean follow-up of ≥12 months after the index procedure. The following data were extracted: (i) single-procedure success, (ii) multiple-procedure success, and (iii) drug-free success. Fifteen studies involving 531 patients were included. Single-procedure freedom from atrial arrhythmia at the latest follow-up was 45.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 34.8-56.2%]. With multiple procedures, the final success rate was 66.1% (95% CI: 55.3-76.9%) overall, 71.8% (95% CI: 61.6-82.0%) in paroxysmal AF, and 47.5% (95% CI: 36.0-59.0%) in non-paroxysmal AF. Without anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs), single-procedure success rate at latest follow-up was 32.9% (95% CI: 21.7-41.1%); after multiple procedures, this raised to 50.4% (95% CI: 39.2-61.6%). The incidence of serious periprocedural complications was acceptable [5.1% (95% CI: 2.8-9.6%)]. Substantial heterogeneity (I(2)> 50%) was noted in the above groups. CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of AF in patients with HCM is feasible, although more repeat procedures and AAD are needed to prevent AF recurrence.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: A dilated/end-stage phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is rare but well-recognized. The role for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in this subset of patients remains unexplored. We aimed to clarify the impact of bi-ventricular pacing CRT in dilated/end-stage HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Mayo Clinic HCM database was interrogated to identify patients with ejection fraction (EF) <50% and CRT. Control subjects were identified in 1:1 manner. Clinical outcomes were determined. Of 2073 patients with HCM, 9 (8 male) had EF <50% and received CRT. The average age at CRT-D implant was 44.8 ± 14.8 years, an average of 17.3 ± 10.3 years after HCM diagnosis. The indication for CRT was based on New York Heart Association class ≥II symptoms (mean 2.7 ± 0.4) and EF <50% in all patients (EF 34.7 ± 7.1% at implant), with electrocardiographic evidence of abnormal ventricular conduction. At 6-month, 12-month, and long-term follow-up, EF was 39.9 ± 8.4%, 37.9 ± 9.8%, and 33.3 ± 7.6%, respectively (P > 0.05 for all). There was no difference in the combined end-point of left ventricular assist device (LVAD), cardiac transplant, or death between groups (P = 0.90). At last follow-up [mean duration 12.9 ± 8.3 (median 10.7) years], 8 (89%) in the CRT group were alive. Three and 2 patients underwent LVAD implantation and cardiac heart transplantation, respectively, 15.0 ± 10.1 years from HCM diagnosis and 2.6 ± 0.9 years from CRT implant. In the control group, 4 (44.4%) patients were alive at last follow-up [mean duration 12.0 ± 7.1 (median 12.7) years]. One patient each had LVAD and cardiac transplant. CONCLUSIONS: CRT in patients with dilated/end-stage HCM does not appear to confer a salutary effect on ventricular function. In medium-term follow-up, however, left ventricular function did not appear to deteriorate further, yet advanced heart failure therapy was common in this group.",

We aimed to investigate the use and real-world safety of catheter ablation for AF in patients with HCM. Methods and Results We drew data from the US National Inpatient Sample to identify cases of AF ablation in HCM patients between 2003 and 2015. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, and incidence of catheter ablation complications, mortality, and length of stay were analyzed, including trends between the early (2003-2008) and later (2009-2015) study years. Among a weighted total of 1563 catheter ablation cases in patients with HCM, the median age was 62 (interquartile range, 52-72), 832 (53.2%) were male, and 1150 (73.6%) were white. The average annual volume of AF ablations in patients with HCM doubled between the early and the later study period (79-156). At least 1 complication occurred in 16.1% of cases, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1%. Cardiac and pericardial complications declined from 8.8% to 2.3% and from 2.8% to 0.9%, respectively, between the early and the later study years (P<0.01). Independent predictors of complications included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.81; 95% CI, 2.72-8.51), diabetes mellitus (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 2.68-16.09) and obesity (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.61-9.06). Conclusions Despite some decline in procedural complications over the years, catheter ablation for AF is still associated with a relatively high periprocedural morbidity and even mortality in patients with HCM. This emphasizes the importance of careful clinical consideration, by an experienced electrophysiologist, in referring patients with HCM for an AF ablation.",

This nationwide population-based study extracted 14,542 HCM patients from the National Health Insurance Service database between 2015-2016, and investigated their ED utilization during a one-year period. The reason for ED utilization was defined as the primary diagnosis upon discharge from EDs. The clinical outcome was defined as hospitalization or all-cause mortality within 90 days after the ED visits. A total of 3209 (22.1%) HCM patients visited EDs within a one-year period (mean age, 66.8 ± 13.8 years; male, 57.4%). The majority (71.1%) of HCM patients who visited the EDs were aged ≥ 60 years. The ED utilization rate was higher in women than in men (26.3% versus 19.7%, P < 0.001). Cardiovascular diseases were the most common reason for ED visits (n = 1333, 41.5%). Among HCM patients who visited EDs, 1195 (37.2%) were hospitalized, and 231 (7.2%) died within 90 days. ED visits for cardiovascular disease was associated with a higher 90-day all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.72; 95% confidence interval 1.79-4.12). These findings would serve as a basis for future research to establish medical policies on ED utilization in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Prior studies have suggested causal relationships between obesity and acute cardiovascular events. It has been also known that the risk of acute cardiovascular events is reduced by bariatric surgery. However, little is known about whether bariatric surgery lowers the risk of acute cardiovascular events in patients with obesity and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this context, we aimed to investigate whether bariatric surgery is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular-related acute care use in patients with HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this population-based study, the bariatric surgery group consisted of patients with HCM who underwent bariatric surgery from January 2004 to December 2014. The control group included those who have obesity and HCM and received non-bariatric elective intra-abdominal surgery during the same period. The outcome was cardiovascular-related acute care use (i.e. emergency department (ED) visits or unplanned hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease) during a 1-year post-surgery period. We used the SPARCS database, a population-based ED and inpatient database in New York State. We constructed logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations to compare the risk of the outcome events during sequential 6-month post-surgery periods. We adjusted for age, sex, number of ED visits and hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease within 2 years before the index surgery, and the Elixhauser co-morbidity measures. We also performed propensity score (PS)-matching and inverse probability treatment weighting analyses using these variables. The analytic cohort consisted of 207 adults with obesity and HCM, including 147 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and 60 in the control group. The risk was not significantly different in the 1-6 months post-surgery period. By contrast, in the 7-12 months post-surgery period, the risk of cardiovascular-related acute care use was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery group (adjusted odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.068-0.71; P = 0.01) compared with the control group. In the PS-matched cohort, there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics. The PS-matched analysis demonstrated lower risk of the outcome event in the bariatric surgery group in the 7-12 months post-surgery period. The inverse probability treatment weighting analysis replicated the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular-related acute care use in the 7-12 months post-surgery period in this population-based study.",

Contemporary outcomes and care processes after STEMI are extensively examined; however, there are limited data on outcomes, and revascularization strategies of HCM patients with STEMI. The National Inpatient Sample 2004-2018 was queried to identify adult patients presenting with a primary diagnosis of STEMI, of whom a subset of patients with concomitant diagnosis of HCM were identified. Complex samples multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to determine the association of HCM with in-hospital outcomes. HCM patients with STEMI who were revascularized were compared with their counterparts who were not revascularized. Of 3,049,068 primary STEMI hospitalizations, 2583 (0.8%) had an associated diagnosis of HCM. HCM patients were more likely to be elderly and female with less traditional cardiovascular risk factors compared to those without HCM. HCM patients were less likely to receive revascularization compared to those without HCM. STEMI with HCM was associated with similar in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.44; P = 0.561) compared to those without HCM. Notably, HCM patients who were revascularized had similar in-hospital mortality (aOR 0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.33; P = 0.266) compared to HCM patients who did not receive revascularization.

We conducted a meta-analysis to update the current clinical evidence on the efficacy of CA for AF in patients with HCM. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Clinicaltrials.gov for interventional and observational studies assessing single and multiple procedure success rate of CA in HCM patients. Our meta-analysis included 25 studies involving 1817 patients. Success rate following single procedure was 40.4% (95% CI 33.1 to 48.0%) at latest follow-up. The pooled success rate following multiple procedures was 51.4% (95% CI 42.9% to 60.0%) at latest follow-up. In the subgroup analysis for AF subtype, TCA was more successful for paroxysmal AF compared to non-paroxysmal AF. For the subset of studies reporting drug-free success rate, single and multiple procedures had a success rate of 33.4% (95% CI 19.3 to 49.1%) and 51.8% (95% CI 41.3 to 62.2%) at latest follow-up, respectively. CA is a suitable option for AF in patients with HCM. Success rate is greater in paroxysmal AF, after multiple procedures and with antiarrhythmic drugs.",

        "Abstract Note": "Pulmonary vein isolation has become a cornerstone treatment for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent reports show that additional ablation targeting low-voltage zones reduces AF recurrence. However, the pre-procedural predictors of low-voltage zones remain elusive. We retrospectively enrolled 359 patients (mean age 63.7 ± 10.8 years; 73 females; and 149 had persistent atrial fibrillation) who underwent catheter ablation for AF and left atrial (LA) voltage mapping during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing. Low-voltage zones were defined as area of > 5 cm2 with a bipolar electrogram amplitude of < 0.50 mV. Overall, 51 (14.2%) patients had low-voltage zones. Patients with low-voltage zones were older (67.9 ± 9.9 vs. 63.0 ± 10.8 years; P = 0.003), predominantly female (33.3% vs. 18.2%; P = 0.013), had higher prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (11.8% vs. 1.6%; P = 0.002) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (9.8% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.025), and had larger LA volumes (153.6 ± 46.4 vs. 117.7 ± 67.8 mL; P < 0.001) than those without low-voltage zones. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (OR 1.060; 95% CI 1.022-1.101, P = 0.002), female sex (OR 2.978; 95% CI 1.340-6.615, P = 0.007), DCM (OR 8.341; 95% CI 1.381-50.372, P = 0.021), HCM (OR 5.044; 95% CI 1.314-19.363, P = 0.018), persistent AF (OR 4.188; 95% CI 1.928-9.100, P < 0.001), and larger LA volume (OR 3.215; 95% CI 1.378-7.502, P = 0.007) were independently associated with the presence of low-voltage zones. Patient age, female sex, DCM, HCM, persistent AF and larger LA volume may predict the presence of low-voltage zones and could be useful in selecting the appropriate ablation strategy for AF.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with left ventricular (LV) mid-cavity obstruction (LVMCO) often experience severe drug-refractory symptoms thought to be related to intraventricular obstruction. We tested whether ventricular pacing, guided by invasive haemodynamic assessment, reduced LVMCO and improved refractory symptoms. METHODS: Between December 2008 and December 2017, 16 HCM patients with severe refractory symptoms and LVMCO underwent device implantation with haemodynamic pacing study to assess the effect on invasively defined LVMCO gradients. The effect on the gradient of atrioventricular (AV) synchronous pacing from sites including right ventricular (RV) apex and middle cardiac vein (MCV) was retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Invasive haemodynamic data were available in 14 of 16 patients. Mean pre-treatment intracavitary gradient was 77 ± 22 mmHg (in sinus rhythm) versus 21 ± 21 mmHg during pacing from optimal ventricular site (95% CI: -70.86 to -40.57, p < 0.0001). Optimal pacing site was distal MCV in 12/16 (86%), RV apex in 1/16 and via epicardial LV lead in 1/16. Pre-pacing Doppler-derived gradients were significantly higher than at follow-up (47 ± 15 versus 24 ± 16 mmHg, 95% CI: -37.19 to -13.73, p < 0.001). Median baseline NYHA class was 3, which had improved by ⩾1 NYHA class in 13 of 16 patients at 1-year post-procedure (p < 0.001). The mean follow-up duration was 4.6 ± 2.7 years with the following outcomes: 8/16 (50%) had continued symptomatic improvement, 4/16 had symptomatic decline and 4/16 died. Contributors to symptomatic decline included chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) (n = 5), phrenic nerve stimulation (n = 3) and ventricular ectopy (n = 1). CONCLUSION: In drug-refractory symptomatic LVMCO, distal ventricular pacing can reduce intracavitary obstruction and may provide long-term symptomatic relief in patients with limited treatment options. A haemodynamic pacing study is an effective strategy for identifying optimal pacing site and configuration.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is rare in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), management of which is challenging. Limited data exists on the utility of catheter ablation for the treatment of VT in this population. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess clinical outcomes of catheter ablation for VT in HCM patients. METHODS: A systematic search, without language restriction, using PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. The meta-analysis was performed using a meta-package for R version 4.0/RStudio version 1.2 and Freeman Tukey double arcsine method to establish the variance of raw proportions. Outcomes measured included (1) acute procedure success (defined as noninducible for clinical VT), (2) freedom from VT at follow-up, (3) mortality. RESULTS: This systematic review of six studies (three from the United States and three from Japan) incorporated a total of 68 drug-refractory HCM patients who underwent VT radiofrequency catheter ablation (mean age 57.6 ± 13.3 years, mean LVEF 45.8 ± 15.4%, 85% men, maximum septal wall thickness 17.4 ± 4.6 mm, and 32.3% with an apical aneurysm). Acute procedural success was achieved in 84.5% patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 70.6%-95.2%) with 27.9% patients had recurrent VT requiring multiple ablations (median 1, IQR 1-3). During the follow-up period (18.3 ± 11.7 months), the pooled incidence of freedom from recurrent VT after index procedure was 70.2% (95% CI: 51.9%-86.2%), while after the last ablation was 82.8% (95% CI: 57%-99.2%). There were two deaths during follow-up, one from heart failure and one from SCD 0.8% (95% CI: 0%-5.8%). CONCLUSION: The results of our pooled analysis demonstrated that catheter ablation for VT in HCM patients was associated with high acute procedural success, and reduced VT recurrence-findings comparable to previously published reports in other disease substrates.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency transcatheter ablation (RFCA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been proven feasible. However, the long-term results of RFCA and its impact on clinical course of HCM are unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse clinical outcomes and long-term efficacy of RFCA in a multicentre cohort of patients with HCM and concomitant AF. METHODS: Patients with HCM and AF consecutively undergoing RFCA were included. Ablation failure was defined as recurrence of AF, atrial tachycardia, or flutter lasting more than 3 min and occurring after the blanking period. RESULTS: Overall, 116 patients with symptomatic AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs were included. Over a median follow-up of 6.0 years (interquartile range: 3.0-8.9 years) recurrence rate after a single RFCA was 32.3 per 100 patient/years with 26% of patients free from AF relapses at 6-year follow-up. Among patients experiencing AF recurrence, 51 (66%) underwent at least one redo-procedure. The overall recurrence rate considering redo-procedures was 12.6 per 100 patients/years with 53% of patients free from AF relapses at 6 years. At last follow-up, with an average of 1.6 procedures, 67 (61%) patients were in sinus rhythm (SR). Patients remaining in SR showed better functional status compared with those experiencing arrhythmic recurrences (NYHA Class 1.6 ± 0.1 vs. 2.0 ± 0.1, p = .009). CONCLUSIONS: RFCA of AF in HCM patients is an effective and safe strategy favoring long-term SR maintenance, reduction of atrial arrhythmic events, and improved functional status. However, most patients need repeat procedures and continuation of antiarrhythmic drugs.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) require chronic anticoagulation due to high thromboembolic risk. Evidence supporting the use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with HCM remains sparse, and there are no data regarding the use of NOACs in patients with HCM undergoing catheter ablation of AF. METHODS: Observational nonrandomized study in four European centers. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of NOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with HCM undergoing catheter ablation for AF. RESULTS: A total of 137 patients with HCM (mean age: 55.0 ± 13.4, 29.1% female) underwent 230 catheter ablations for AF (1.7 ± 1.0 per patient). A total of 55 patients (39.4%) underwent 70 procedures (30.4%) on NOAC, while the remaining were on VKA. Warfarin (97.6%) and rivaroxaban (56.4%) were the most frequently used agents in the respective groups. No procedure-related deaths were reported. We observed no significant difference in the rate of thromboembolism (VKA: 0.6%; NOAC: 0%; p = 1.0) or minor bleeding (VKA: 0.6%; NOAC: 1.4%; p = .54). There was a nonsignificant trend towards a lower incidence of major bleeding (VKA: 6.9%; NOAC: 1.4%; p = .09). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that NOACs are at least as safe and effective as VKAs in patients with HCM undergoing catheter ablation for AF.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: This study characterizes left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient variability in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) during cardiac catheterization. BACKGROUND: Management of HCM is directed by the presence and magnitude of LVOT obstruction. The magnitude and clinical impact of spontaneous variability during a single cardiac catheterization has not been described. METHODS: Fifty symptomatic patients with HCM (mean age 55 ± 15 years; 48% men) underwent cardiac catheterization with high-fidelity, micromanometer-tip catheters and transseptal measurement of left ventricular pressures. Obstruction was defined as resting LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mm Hg and severe obstruction as ≥ 50 mm Hg. Variability in LVOT gradient was calculated as the difference of the largest and smallest LVOT gradients in the absence of provocative maneuvers or interventions. RESULTS: The largest LVOT gradient was 54.6 ± 56.4 mm Hg. The spontaneous variability in LVOT gradient was 49.0 ± 53.1 mm Hg (range 0 to 210.8 mm Hg, median 15 mm Hg). Discrepant classification of resting LVOT gradient severity was possible in 25 patients (50%). Twenty patients (40%) with severe obstruction could have been misclassified with regard to obstruction severity. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, the LVOT gradient fluctuates significantly during a single hemodynamic assessment. Spontaneous variability could lead to misclassification of obstruction severity in one-half of studied patients. The dynamic nature of LVOT obstruction must be considered when assessing resting hemodynamics or the success of a given intervention during cardiac catheterization.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of septal ablation on diastolic function with the use of invasive hemodynamics. BACKGROUND: Septal ablation is an alternative therapy for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, its beneficial effect on diastolic function, by relieving the systolic contraction load, may be countered by adverse effects from the infarction on left ventricular mechanics. METHODS: Using high-fidelity, micromanometer-tipped catheters, we examined 40 HCM patients by taking direct measurements of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient, time constant of myocardial relaxation (tau), and left atrial pressure (LAP) before and after septal ablation. RESULTS: Although there was an overall reduction in LVOT gradient, septal ablation resulted in variable changes in myocardial relaxation and left atrial pressure. In 20 patients (50%), LAP increased. The magnitude of LVOT gradient reduction directly correlated with the effects of septal ablation on LAP (R = 0.58; p < 0.0001). Those patients with a greater decrease in the LVOT gradient had better improvement in direct LAP. Furthermore, those patients with a larger decrease in left ventricular outflow tract gradient had a beneficial enhancement of ventricular relaxation, as measured by tau (R = 0.43; p = 0.006). Thus, the beneficial enhancement of relaxation was directly related to improvement in LAP (R = 0.75; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Septal ablation results in variable effects on left ventricular filling pressure, which are dependent upon the magnitude of reduction in the LVOT gradient. These effects are mediated in part by effects of ablation on myocardial relaxation. These findings shed insight into the pathophysiologic effects of septal reduction therapy in patients with HCM.",

The aim of this study was to validate the HCM Risk-SCD model in patients undergoing alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and to compare its performance to previous models. METHODS AND RESULT: A total of 844 ASA patients without prior SCD event were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of SCD and appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, identical to the HCM Risk-SCD endpoint. A distinction between periprocedural (≤30 days) and long-term (>30 days) SCD was made to discern procedure-related adverse arrhythmic events caused by the ASA-induced myocardial infarction from long-term SCD risk. Twenty patients reached the SCD endpoint within the first 30 days. During a follow-up of 6.5 ± 4.2 years, another 46 patients reached the SCD endpoint. The predicted 5-year SCD risk according to the HCM Risk-SCD model was 5.1%, and the observed 5-year SCD risk was 4.0%. The C-statistics for the use of the HCM Risk-SCD model was 0.61 (P = 0.02), the C-statistics for the use of the 2003 American College of Cardiology/ESC guidelines was 0.59 (P = 0.051), and the C-statistic for the use of the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines was 0.58 (P = 0.054). Maximal left ventricular wall thickness, syncope after ASA, and fulfilling the 2014 ESC recommendations for primary ICD implantation according to the HCM Risk-SCD model, respectively, predicted SCD during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The HCM Risk-SCD model can be used for SCD prediction in patients undergoing ASA.",

However, the predictors of RFCA efficacy remain largely unknown. We assessed the outcome of a multicentre HCM cohort following RFCA for symptomatic AF refractory to medical therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (age 54 +/- 13 years; time from AF onset 5.7 +/- 5.5 years) with paroxysmal (n = 35; 57%), recent persistent (n = 15; 25%), or long-standing persistent AF (n = 11; 18%) were enrolled. A scheme with pulmonary vein isolation plus linear lesions was employed. Of the 61 patients, 32 (52%) required redo procedures. Antiarrhythmic therapy was maintained in 22 (54%). At the end of a 29 +/- 16 months follow-up, 41 patients (67%) were in sinus rhythm, including 17 of the 19 patients aged < or = 50 years, with marked improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (1.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.7 at baseline; P < 0.001). In the remaining 20 patients (33%), with AF recurrence, there was less marked, but still significant, improvement following RFCA (NYHA class 1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.7 at baseline; P = 0.002). Independent predictors of AF recurrence were increased left atrium volume [hazard ratio (HR) per unit increase 1.009, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001-1.018; P = 0.037] and NYHA functional class (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.16-4.35; P = 0.016). Among 11 genotyped HCM patients (6 with MYBPC3, 2 with MYH7, 1 with MYL2 and 2 with multiple mutations), RFCA success rate was comparable with that of the overall cohort (n = 8; 73%). CONCLUSION: RFCA was successful in restoring long-term sinus rhythm and improving symptomatic status in most HCM patients with refractory AF, including the subset with proven sarcomere gene mutations, although redo procedures were often necessary. Younger HCM patients with small atrial size and mild symptoms proved to be the best RFCA candidates, likely due to lesser degrees of atrial remodelling.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) has been developed to avert risks associated with transvenous defibrillator leads. The technology is attractive for younger patients, such as those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are limited data on S-ICD use in HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: HCM patients identified at risk for sudden death were considered for S-ICD implantation. Patients were screened for potential oversensing by surface electrocardiography (ECG). At implant, defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing was performed at 65, 50, and 35 joules (J). Twenty-seven patients were considered for S-ICD implantation, and after screening, 23 (85%) remained eligible. The presence of a bundle branch block was associated with screening failure, whereas elevated body mass index (BMI) showed a trend toward association. One patient passed screening at rest, but failed with an ECG obtained after exercise. At implant, the S-ICD terminated ventricular fibrillation (VF) with a 65J shock in all 15 implanted patients and a 50J shock was successful in 12 of 15. A 35J shock terminated VF in 10 of 12 patients. DFT failure at 50 J was associated with a higher BMI. There were no appropriate shocks after a median follow-up of 17.5 (3-35) months, and 1 patient received an inappropriate shock attributable to a temporary reduction in QRS amplitude while bending forward, resulting in oversensing, despite successful screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk HCM cohort without a pacing indication referred for consideration of an ICD, the majority were eligible for S-ICD. The S-ICD is effective at recognizing and terminating VF at implant with a wide safety margin.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Biventricular (BiV) pacing is an established therapy for heart failure in ischaemic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Its effects in end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are unknown. AIMS: To assess the potential benefits of BiV pacing in patients with symptomatic end-stage HCM. METHODS: Twenty patients with non-obstructive HCM (12 male, mean age 57+/-13 years), left bundle branch block and symptoms of heart failure refractory to medical therapy underwent implantation of a BiV device. NYHA class, echocardiographic parameters and exercise capacity were assessed before and after implantation. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 13+/-6 months, an improvement of at least one NYHA class was reported in 8 (40%) patients. A clinical response was associated with an increase in ejection fraction (from 41+/-14% to 50+/-12%, p=0.009), and reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (from 57+/-6 mm to 52+/-7 mm, p=0.031) and left atrial diameter (from 65+/-8 mm to 57+/-6 mm, p=0.005). Percentage predicted peak oxygen consumption was unchanged in responders but significantly declined in non-responders (p=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: BiV pacing improved heart failure symptoms in a significant proportion of patients with end-stage HCM. Symptomatic improvement was associated with reverse remodelling of the left atrium and ventricle.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is more common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is often highly symptomatic. The impact of catheter ablation (CA) may be under-reported when evaluated by long-term freedom from any atrial arrhythmia. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate whether CA of AF in patients with HCM would significantly reduce AF burden and improve symptoms. METHODS: A multicenter registry was established to enroll HCM patients with pre-existing cardiac implantable electronic devices undergoing CA of AF between 2017 and 2021. The first AF recurrence and burden 12 months before and after CA were determined. RESULTS: A total of 81 HCM patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices underwent CA of AF. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 1-year (35 [Q1-Q3: 23-50] months). AF was paroxysmal in 38 of 81 (46.9%) patients and burden pre-CA was 27.0% (Q1-Q3: 3.0% to 99.0%). A total of 35 (43.2%) patients had AF/atrial tachycardia recurrence within 12 months. AF burden reduced after CA to 0.5% (Q1-Q3 range: 0.0% to 11.1%) (P = 0.001); a 95% CI (13.8% to 100%) relative reduction. European Hearth Rhythm Association class improved by 1.8 ± 1.3 classes (P < 0.001). Of those with AF/atrial tachycardia recurrence, the reduction in AF burden was -33.7% (Q1-Q3: -88.9% to -13.8%) (P < 0.001) and 20 (57.1%) patients reported symptomatic improvement by ≥1 European Hearth Rhythm Association class. AF burden reduction was associated with symptomatic improvement. (r = -0.67; P < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: AF recurrence is common after CA in HCM patients, but this may under-represent the impact of CA in this cohort. CA significantly reduced AF burden and improved symptoms. A comprehensive evaluation of AF burden, symptoms, and hard endpoints is needed to determine the utility of CA in this context.",

OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate interim results from the EXPLORER-Long Term Extension (LTE) cohort of MAVA-LTE (A Long-Term Safety Extension Study of Mavacamten in Adults Who Have Completed EXPLORER-HCM; NCT03723655). METHODS: After mavacamten or placebo withdrawal at the end of the parent EXPLORER-HCM (Clinical Study to Evaluate Mavacamten [MYK-461] in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; NCT03470545), patients could enroll in MAVA-LTE. Patients received mavacamten 5 mg once daily; adjustments were made based on site-read echocardiograms. RESULTS: Between April 9, 2019, and March 5, 2021, 231 of 244 eligible patients (94.7%) enrolled in MAVA-LTE (mean age: 60 years; 39% female). At data cutoff (August 31, 2021) 217 (93.9%) remained on treatment (median time in study: 62.3 weeks; range: 0.3-123.9 weeks). At 48 weeks, patients showed improvements in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients (mean change ± SD from baseline: resting: -35.6 ± 32.6 mm Hg; Valsalva: -45.3 ± 35.9 mm Hg), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (median: -480 ng/L; Q1-Q3: -1,104 to -179 ng/L), and NYHA functional class (67.5% improved by ≥1 class). LVOT gradients and NT-proBNP reductions were sustained through 84 weeks in patients who reached this timepoint. Over 315 patient-years of exposure, 8 patients experienced an adverse event of cardiac failure, and 21 patients had an adverse event of atrial fibrillation, including 11 with no prior history of atrial fibrillation. Twelve patients (5.2%) developed transient reductions in site-read echocardiogram left ventricular ejection fraction of <50%, resulting in temporary treatment interruption; all recovered. Ten patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-emergent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Mavacamten treatment showed clinically important and durable improvements in LVOT gradients, NT-proBNP levels, and NYHA functional class, consistent with EXPLORER-HCM. Mavacamten treatment was well tolerated over a median 62-week follow-up.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Data on the efficacy of catheter ablation of AF in HCM patients are sparse. METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational multicentre study in 137 HCM patients (mean age 55.0 ± 13.4, 29.1% female; 225 ablation procedures). We investigated (i) the efficacy of catheter ablation for AF beyond the initial 12 months; (ii) the available risk scores, stratification schemes and genotype as potential predictors of arrhythmia relapse, and (iii) the impact of cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency in procedural outcomes. Mean follow-up was 43.8 ± 37.0 months. Recurrences after the initial 12-month period post-ablation were frequent, and 24 months after the index procedure, nearly all patients with persistent AF had relapsed, and only 40% of those with paroxysmal AF remained free from arrhythmia recurrence. The APPLE score demonstrated a modest discriminative capacity for AF relapse post-ablation (c-statistic 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75; P = 0.022), while the risk stratification schemes for sudden death did not. On multivariable analysis, left atrium diameter and LV apical aneurysm were independent predictors of recurrence. Fifty-eight patients were genotyped; arrhythmia-free survival was similar among subjects with different gene mutations. Rate of procedural complications was high (9.3%), although reducing over time. Outcome for cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation was comparable. CONCLUSION: Very late AF relapses post-ablation is common in HCM patients, especially in those with persistent AF. Left atrium size, LV apical aneurysm, and the APPLE score might contribute to identify subjects at higher risk of arrhythmia recurrence. First-time cryoballoon is comparable with radiofrequency ablation.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several medications and recommend better drug treatments for adults with HCM. METHODS: A review of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov and CNKI databases was conducted for studies on the efficacy and safety of drugs for adults with HCM. A frequentist random effects model was used in this network analysis. RESULTS: This network meta-analysis included 7 studies assessing seven medications, 6 studies evaluating monotherapy and 1 study evaluating combination therapy. Based on the network meta-analysis results, xiaoxinbi formula plus metoprolol (MD -56.50% [-72.43%, -40.57%]), metoprolol (MD -47.00% [-59.07%, -34.93%]) and mavacamten (MD -34.50% [-44.75%, -24.25%]) significantly reduced the resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOTG) in comparison with placebo. Resting LVOTG could also be reduced with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The incidence of adverse drug reactions was not significantly different between the placebo group and the treatment group. CONCLUSION: For adults with HCM, the top 4 treatments included xiaoxinbi formula plus metoprolol, metoprolol, mavacamten and NAC.Systematic Review Registration: [https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=374222], identifier [CRD42022374222].",

The clinical efficacy of aficamten across multiple outcome domains in oHCM has not been fully defined. OBJECTIVES: This responder analysis from the SEQUOIA-HCM (Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults With Symptomatic oHCM) trial characterizes the clinical impact of aficamten. METHODS: Patients who were symptomatic of oHCM were randomized to aficamten (n = 142) or placebo (n = 140) daily for 24 weeks. Outcomes assessed included the proportion of patients with complete hemodynamic response (rest and Valsalva gradient <30 mm Hg and <50 mm Hg, respectively), relief in limiting symptoms (≥1 improvement in NYHA functional class and/or ≥10-point change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score), enhanced exercise capacity (≥1.5 mL/kg/min change in peak oxygen uptake), and ≥50% reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Eligibility for septal reduction therapy was also evaluated. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, patients treated with aficamten vs placebo showed significant improvement in limiting symptoms (71% vs 42%), were more likely to have complete hemodynamic response (68% vs 7%), demonstrated enhanced exercise capacity (47% vs 24%), and showed a decrease ≥50% in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (84% vs 8%) (P ≤ 0.002 for all). An improvement in ≥1 of these outcome measures was achieved in 97% of patients treated with aficamten (vs 59% placebo), including 23% on aficamten who achieved all 4 outcomes compared with none in placebo. Among 32 patients receiving aficamten and 29 patients receiving placebo who were eligible for septal reduction therapy, 28 (88%) from the aficamten group were no longer eligible at 24 weeks compared with 15 (52%) from the placebo group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with aficamten was associated with substantial improvements across a broad range of clinically relevant efficacy measures. These results underscore the wide-ranging potential of aficamten for treatment of patients with symptomatic oHCM (Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults with oHCM [SEQUOIA-HCM]; NCT05186818).",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the atrial substrate of patients with MYBPC3- or MYH7-mediated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and its impact on catheter ablation outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of patients with HCM who underwent genetic testing and catheter ablation for AF was performed. Patients with MYBPC3- or MYH7-mediated HCM formed the gene-positive cohort; those without disease-causative genetic variants formed the control cohort. High-density electroanatomical mapping was performed using a 3-dimensional mapping system, followed by radiofrequency ablation. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in the gene-positive cohort (mean age 55.6 ± 9.9 years, 83% men, 50% MYBPC3, 50% MYH7, mean ejection fraction 59.3% ± 13.7%, mean left atrial [LA] volume index 51.7 ± 13.1 mL/m2, mean LA pressure 20.2 ± 5.4 mm Hg) and 15 patients in the control arm (mean age 61.5 ± 12.6 years, 60% men, mean ejection fraction 64.9% ± 5.1%, mean LA volume index 54.1 ± 12.8 mL/m2, mean LA pressure 19.6 ± 5.41 mm Hg). Electroanatomical mapping demonstrated normal voltage in 87.7% ± 5.03% of the LA in the gene-positive cohort and 94.3% ± 3.58% of the LA in the control cohort (P < 0.001). Of the abnormal regions, intermediate scar (0.1-0.5 mV) accounted for 6.33% ± 1.97% in the gene-positive cohort and 3.07% ± 2.46% in the control cohort (P < 0.01). Dense scar (<0.1 mV) accounted for 5.93% ± 3.20% in the gene-positive cohort and 2.61% ± 2.19% in the control cohort (P < 0.01). Freedom from AF at 12 months was similar between the gene-positive (75%) and control (73%) cohorts (P = 0.92), though a greater number of procedures were required in the gene-positive cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MYBPC3- or MYH7-mediated HCM undergoing AF ablation have appreciably more low-amplitude LA signals, suggestive of fibrosis. However, catheter ablation remains an effective rhythm-control strategy.",

The health status benefits of aficamten, a novel cardiac myosin inhibitor, have not been comprehensively described. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of aficamten on patient-reported health status, including symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, physical and social limitations, and quality of life. METHODS: SEQUOIA-HCM (Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults With Symptomatic oHCM) randomized symptomatic adults with oHCM to 24 weeks of aficamten (n = 142) or placebo (n = 140), followed by a 4-week washout. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire 7-item (SAQ7) were serially administered. Changes in mean KCCQ-Overall Summary Score (KCCQ-OSS) and SAQ7-Summary Score (SAQ7-SS) from baseline to 24 weeks and following treatment withdrawal were compared using linear regression adjusted for baseline scores and randomization strata. Proportions of patients with clinically important changes were compared. RESULTS: Among 282 participants, the mean age was 59 ± 13 years, 115 (41%) were female, and 223 (79%) were White. Baseline KCCQ-OSS (69.3 ± 20.1 vs 67.3 ± 18.8) and SAQ7-SS (72.0 ± 21.0 vs 72.4 ± 18.3) were similar between aficamten and placebo groups. Treatment with aficamten, compared with placebo, improved both the mean KCCQ-OSS (13.3 ± 16.3 vs 6.1 ± 12.6; mean difference: 7.9; 95% CI: 4.8-11.0; P < 0.001) and SAQ7-SS (11.6 ± 17.4 vs 3.8 ± 14.4; mean difference: 7.8; 95% CI: 4.7-11.0; P < 0.001) at 24 weeks, with benefits emerging within 4 weeks. No heterogeneity in treatment effect was found across subgroups. A much larger proportion of participants experienced a very large health status improvement (≥20 points) with aficamten vs placebo (KCCQ-OSS: 29.7% vs 12.4%, number needed to treat: 5.8; SAQ7-SS: 31.2% vs 13.9%, number needed to treat: 5.8). Participants' health status worsened significantly more after withdrawal from aficamten than placebo (KCCQ-OSS: -16.2 ± 19.0 vs -3.0 ± 9.6; P < 0.001; SAQ7-SS: -17.4 ± 21.4 vs -2.5 ± 13.3), further confirming a causal effect of aficamten. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic oHCM, treatment with aficamten resulted in markedly improved health status, including significant improvement in chest pain-related health status, than placebo.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the long-term outcomes (all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death [SCD]) after medical therapy, alcohol septal ablation (ASA), and myectomy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: Therapy-resistant obstructive HCM can be treated both surgically and percutaneously. But there is no consensus on the long-term effects of ASA, especially on SCD. METHODS: This study included 1,047 consecutive patients with HCM (mean age 52 ± 16 years, 61% men) from 3 tertiary referral centers. A total of 690 patients (66%) had left ventricular outflow tract gradients ≥ 30 mm Hg, of whom 124 (12%) were treated medically, 316 (30%) underwent ASA, and 250 (24%) underwent myectomy. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and SCD. Kaplan-Meier graphs and Cox regression models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 7.6 ± 5.3 years. Ten-year survival was similar in medically treated patients (84%), ASA patients (82%), myectomy patients (85%), and patients with nonobstructive HCM (85%) (log-rank p = 0.50). The annual rate of SCD was low after invasive therapy: 1.0%/year in the ASA group and 0.8%/year in the myectomy group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the risk for SCD was lower after myectomy compared with the ASA group (hazard ratio: 2.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 4.4; p = 0.04) and the medical group (hazard ratio: 2.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 5.2; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obstructive HCM who are treated at referral centers for HCM care have good survival and low SCD risk, similar to that of patients with nonobstructive HCM. The SCD risk of patients after myectomy was lower than after ASA or in the medical group.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is present in 1/3 of children with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). Disopyramide improves symptoms associated with LVOTO and delays surgical intervention in adults, but it is not licensed in children. AIM: To describe a single-centre thirty-year experience of using disopyramide to treat LVOTO-related symptoms in a paediatric HCM cohort. METHODS: Clinical data were collected for all patients meeting diagnostic criteria for HCM (<18 years) at the time of initiation, 6 months after, and last follow-up or end of disopyramide treatment. It included demographics, clinical history, 12‑lead electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Comparisons between baseline and 6 month follow up, and end of follow up respectively were performed. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with HCM were started on disopyramide at a mean age 10.2±5.3 years. At 6 months, of those previously symptomatic, 33(86.8%) reported an improvement of symptoms and 12(31.6%) were asymptomatic. PR interval, corrected QT interval and maximal LVOT gradient had not significantly changed, but fewer participants were noted to have systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve 31 (72.1%) vs. 26 (57.80%). Patients were followed up for a median of 1.9 years (IQR 0.83-4.5). Nine patients (17.6%) reported side effects, and eleven patients (33.3%) with initial improvement in symptoms reported a return or worsening of symptoms requiring a change in medication (n = 4, 12.1%) or left ventricular septal myomectomy (n = 7, 21.2%) during follow up. CONCLUSION: Disopyramide is a safe and effective treatment for LVOTO-related symptoms in childhood obstructive HCM. Any delay in the need for invasive intervention, particularly during childhood, is of clear clinical benefit.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable cardiomyopathy, yet pharmacological therapy has been unchanged for decades until the recent introduction of mavacamten, a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor. We assessed the efficacy and safety of mavacamten in HCM. To date, only 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared the outcomes of mavacamten vs placebo for HCM. We used a fixed effects model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary composite endpoint (PCE) was defined as either ≥1.5 mL/kg/min increase in peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) with ≥1 New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA-FC) improvement or ≥3.0 mL/kg/min increase in pVO2 without worsening of NYHA-FC. Secondary outcomes included ≥1 NYHA-FC improvement, septal reduction therapy (SRT) or guideline eligible for SRT, ≥1 serious adverse event (SAE), ≥1 treatment emergency adverse event (TEAE), atrial fibrillation (AF), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Three RCTs (n = 422, mean follow-up 24 weeks) were included. Compared to placebo, mavacamten achieved higher rates of PCE (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.28-2.88; P = 0.002) and ≥1 NYHA-FC improvement (RR 2.10; 95% CI 1.66-2.67; P < 0.00001) and lower rates of SRT or guideline eligible for SRT (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.22-0.39; P < 0.00001). There were no differences between both groups in ≥1 SAE, AF, and NSVT, however mavacamten had higher rates of ≥1 TEAE. In patients with HCM, mavacamten helps improve pVO2 and NYHA-FC and reduces SRT but may be associated with TEAE. Further research is warranted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of mavacamten.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between exercise hemodynamics, loading conditions, and medical treatment in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effect of metoprolol on invasive hemodynamic parameters at rest and during exercise in patients with obstructive HCM. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial enrolled 28 patients with obstructive HCM and New York Heart Association functional class ≥II. Patients were randomized to initiate either metoprolol 150 mg or placebo for 2 consecutive 2-week periods. Right-heart catheterization and echocardiography were performed at rest and during exercise at the end of each treatment period. The primary outcome was the difference in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (ΔPCWP) between peak exercise and rest. RESULTS: No treatment effect on ΔPCWP was observed between metoprolol and placebo treatment (21 ± 9 mm Hg vs 23 ± 9 mm Hg; P = 0.12). At rest, metoprolol lowered heart rate (P < 0.0001), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (P = 0.01), and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (P = 0.02) and stroke volume (SV) (+6.4; 95% CI: 0.02-17.7; P = 0.049). During peak exercise, metoprolol was associated with a lower heart rate (P < 0.0001), a lower LVOT gradient (P = 0.0005), lesser degree of mitral regurgitation (P = 0.004), and increased SV (+9 mL; 95% CI: 2-15 mL; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with obstructive HCM, exercise was associated with an abnormal rise in PCWP, which was unaffected by metoprolol. However, metoprolol increased SV at rest and peak exercise following changes in end-diastolic volume, LVOT gradient, and degree of mitral regurgitation.

BACKGROUND: The identification of patients at high risk for sudden death and the prevention of recurrence of sudden death in HCM represents a difficult problem. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of cardiac events during follow-up of 13 patients with HCM who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) because of aborted sudden death (n = 10) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 3) (group I). Findings were compared with those in 215 patients with an ICD and other structural heart disease or idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (group II). RESULTS: After a mean (+/-SD) follow-up period of 26+/-18 months, 2 of 13 patients in group I received appropriate shocks. The calculated cumulative incidence of shocks was 21% in group I and 66% in group II after 40 months (p < 0.05). We observed a low incidence of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation during follow-up in patients with HCM. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ventricular tachyarrhythmias may not always be the primary mechanism of syncope and sudden death in patients with HCM. The ICD seems to have a less important impact on prognosis in patients with HCM than in patients with other etiologies of aborted sudden death.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a phase II, randomized, open-label multicentre study that enrolled adult patients with symptomatic non-obstructive HCM (New York Heart Association class I-III) who were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive sacubitril/valsartan (target dose 97/103 mg) or control for 16 weeks.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess the safety, feasibility, and effect of diltiazem as disease-modifying therapy for at-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutation carriers. BACKGROUND: HCM is caused by sarcomere mutations and characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with increased risk of heart failure and sudden death. HCM typically cannot be diagnosed early in life, although subtle phenotypes are present. Animal studies indicate that intracellular calcium handling is altered before LVH develops. Furthermore, early treatment with diltiazem appeared to attenuate disease emergence. METHODS: In a pilot, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 38 sarcomere mutation carriers without LVH (mean 15.8 years of age) to therapy with diltiazem 360 mg/day (or 5 mg/kg/day) or placebo. Treatment duration ranged from 12 to 42 months (median 25 months). Study procedures included electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and serum biomarker measurement. RESULTS: Diltiazem was not associated with serious adverse events. Heart rate and blood pressure did not differ significantly between groups. However, mean left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter improved toward normal in the diltiazem group but decreased further in controls (change in z-scores, +0.6 vs. -0.5; p < 0.001). Mean LV thickness-to-dimension ratio was stable in the diltiazem group but increased in controls (-0.02 vs. +0.15; p = 0.04). Among MYBPC3 mutation carriers, LV wall thickness and mass, diastolic filling, and cardiac troponin I levels improved in those taking diltiazem compared with controls. Four participants developed overt HCM, 2 in each treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-clinical administration of diltiazem is safe and may improve early LV remodeling in HCM. This novel strategy merits further exploration. (Treatment of Preclinical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy With Diltiazem; NCT00319982).",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is being increasingly used in patients with end-stage dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy. There have been no clinical trials addressing the use of LVAD therapy in patients with end-stage heart failure caused by restrictive (RCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The purpose of this study was therefore to analyze the outcome of LVAD therapy in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-three patients received continuous axial flow LVAD (Heart mate II, Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) from February 2007 to May 2010 at our institution. We analyzed the baseline characteristics and surgical and long-term impact of LVAD therapy in 8 patients with RCM or HCM and compared their outcomes with the 75 patients with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Compared with patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, patients with RCM and HCM have significantly smaller left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (52.5±6 mm versus 68.6±8 mm; P<0.0001) and increased thickness of septal (16 [12, 19] mm versus 10[8.5, 11] mm, P=0.0003) and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (21 [20, 36]% versus 17 [15, 22]%; P=0.0009). We found no difference in early mortality (12.5% versus 9.3%, P=0.57) or length of hospital stay (11 [8, 45] days versus 18.5 [12.2, 27.7] days; P=0.51) between the 2 groups. The right atrial pressure was higher (18 [15, 20] mm Hg versus 12 [9, 15] mm Hg, P=0.03), and pump flow was lower (4.3 [3.8, 4.5] L versus 5.2 [4.7, 5.5] L, P=0.001) after LVAD implantation in patients with RCM and HCM. Central venous catheter related infections were more common in patients with RCM and HCM (87.5% versus 44.5%, P=0.006). There was no difference in the total number of blood units transfused. Median (min, max) follow-up duration after LVAD implantation was 166 [1, 1044] days. The 1-year actuarial survival rate was not different between the 2 groups (87.5% [95% confidence interval, 52.9% to 97.8%] versus 73.2 [95% confidence interval, 60% to 85%]; P=0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data show that patients with end-stage heart failure caused by RCM or HCM may benefit from continuous axial flow LVAD therapy. This small study suggests that mortality is comparable with those patients who have dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy, but right heart failure, prolonged inotropic use, and central venous catheter infections are more common in patients with RCM and HCM who were treated with LVAD. Because of the small numbers the differences should be interpreted cautiously, and prospective clinical trials would be required to recommend this therapy for these patients as bridge to transplantation or destination treatment.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: About 25% of patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remain symptomatic despite optimal medical treatment. Some may benefit from pacemaker implantation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of pacemaker implantation on the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient, the maximum thickness of the left ventricle, and functional capacity. METHODS: In total, 72 patients with obstructive HCM and incapacitating symptoms underwent pacemaker implantation. Clinical examination, echocardiography (in 61 patients) and treadmill testing (in 34 patients) were performed before and after implantation. RESULTS: Subjective functional capacity, as assessed using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, improved in 43.1% of patients, but treadmill testing showed no change. There were significant reductions in subaortic gradient, from a median of 87.0 mmHg (interquartile range [IQR] 61.5-115.2 mmHg) to 30.0 mmHg (IQR 18.0-54.5 mmHg; P< .001), and maximum left ventricular thickness, from 22.1+/-4.5 mm to 19.8+/-3.6 mm (P=.001). Univariate analysis identified two factors associated with clinical improvement: female sex (odds ratio [OR]=3.43; P=.020) and functional class III/IV (OR=4.17; P=.009). On multivariate analysis, only functional class III/IV remained a significant predictor (OR=3.12; P=.048). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with obstructive HCM and incapacitating symptoms, pacemaker implantation reduced the LVOT gradient and the maximum left ventricular thickness, but only 43.1% of patients experienced clinical improvement. The only factor predictive of improvement was advanced NYHA functional class.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The phase 2 PIONEER-HCM (Phase 2 Open-label Pilot Study Evaluating Mavacamten in Subjects With Symptomatic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction) study showed that mavacamten improved left ventricular outflow tract gradients, exercise capacity, and symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but the results of longer-term treatment are less well described. We report interim results from the PIONEER-OLE (PIONEER Open-Label Extension) study, the longest-term study of mavacamten in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who previously completed PIONEER-HCM (n=20) were eligible to enroll in PIONEER-OLE. Patients received oral mavacamten, 5 mg once daily (starting dose), with individualized dose titration at week 6. Evaluations included serial monitoring of safety, echocardiography, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary Score, and serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels. Thirteen patients enrolled and received mavacamten (median study duration at data cutoff, 201 weeks). Most patients (92.3%) received β-blockers concomitantly. Treatment-emergent adverse events were predominantly mild/moderate. One patient had an isolated reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction to 47%, which recovered and remained normal with continued treatment at a reduced dose. At week 180, mavacamten was associated with New York Heart Association class improvements from baseline (class II to I, n=9; class III to II, n=1; and unchanged, n=2), sustained reductions in left ventricular outflow tract gradients (mean [SD] change from baseline: resting, -50 [55] mm Hg; Valsalva, -70 [41] mm Hg), and serum NT-proBNP levels (median [interquartile range] change from baseline: -498 [-2184 to -76] ng/L), and improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary Score (mean [SD] change from baseline: +17 [16]). CONCLUSIONS: This long-term analysis supports the continued safety and effectiveness of mavacamten for >3 years in obstructive HCM.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in children and adolescents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: HCM is the most common cause of sudden death in the young. The availability of ICDs over the past decade for HCM has demonstrated the potential for sudden death prevention, predominantly in adult patients. METHODS: A multicenter international registry of ICDs implanted (1987 to 2011) in 224 unrelated children and adolescents with HCM judged at high risk for sudden death was assembled. Patients received ICDs for primary (n = 188) or secondary (n = 36) prevention after undergoing evaluation at 22 referral and nonreferral institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. RESULTS: Defibrillators were activated appropriately to terminate ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in 43 of 224 patients (19%) over a mean of 4.3 ± 3.3 years. ICD intervention rates were 4.5% per year overall, 14.0% per year for secondary prevention after cardiac arrest, and 3.1% per year for primary prevention on the basis of risk factors (5-year cumulative probability 17%). The mean time from implantation to first appropriate discharge was 2.9 ± 2.7 years (range to 8.6 years). The primary prevention discharge rate terminating ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was the same in patients who underwent implantation for 1, 2, or ≥3 risk factors (12 of 88 [14%], 10 of 71 [14%], and 4 of 29 [14%], respectively, p = 1.00). Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was the most common risk factor present (alone or in combination with other markers) in patients experiencing primary prevention interventions (17 of 26 [65%]). ICD-related complications, particularly inappropriate shocks and lead malfunction, occurred in 91 patients (41%) at 17 ± 5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk pediatric HCM cohort, ICD interventions terminating life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias were frequent. Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was most frequently associated with appropriate interventions. The rate of device complications adds a measure of complexity to ICD decisions in this age group.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV outflow tract obstruction, and left atrial dilation, which can be associated with progressive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Aficamten is a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor that reduces outflow tract obstruction by modulating cardiac contractility, with the potential to reverse pathological remodeling and, in turn, reduce cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the effect of aficamten on cardiac remodeling compared with placebo using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and its association with key clinical endpoints in the SEQUOIA-HCM (Safety, Efficacy, and Quantitative Understanding of Obstruction Impact of Aficamten in HCM) CMR substudy. METHODS: SEQUOIA-HCM was a phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for adults with symptomatic oHCM who were randomized 1:1 to 24 weeks of aficamten (dose range: 5-20 mg) or placebo. Eligible participants were offered enrollment in the CMR substudy with studies performed at baseline and week 24. Image analysis was performed in a blinded fashion by a core laboratory. RESULTS: Of the 282 randomized patients, 57 (20%) participated in the substudy, and of those, 50 (88%) completed both baseline and week 24 CMR. Baseline characteristics of the CMR cohort were similar to the overall study population. Of these 50 patients, 21 received aficamten and 29 received placebo. Relative to placebo, patients receiving aficamten demonstrated significant reductions (Δ least-squares mean) in LV mass index (-15 g/m2; 95% CI: -25 to -6 g/m2; P = 0.001), maximal LV wall thickness (-2.1 mm; 95% CI: -3.1 to -1.1 mm; P < 0.001), left atrial volume index (-13 mL/m2; 95% CI: -19 to -7 mL/m2; P < 0.001), native T1 relaxation time (-37 ms; 95% CI: -69 to -5 ms; P = 0.026), indexed extracellular volume fraction (-3.9 g/m2; 95% CI: -7.0 to -0.9 g/m2; P = 0.014), and indexed myocyte mass (-14 g/m2; 95% CI: -23 to -4 g/m2; P = 0.004), while there were no significant changes in LV chamber volumes, LV replacement fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement mass -0.7 g; 95% CI: -2.9 to 1.6 g; P = 0.54), or extracellular volume (0.7%; 95% CI: -2.2% to 3.6%; P = 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The CMR substudy of SEQUOIA-HCM demonstrated that treatment with aficamten relative to placebo for 24 weeks resulted in favorable cardiac remodeling. These changes, particularly with regard to LV mass, wall thickness, and left atrial size, could potentially lead to reduced cardiovascular events including heart failure and atrial fibrillation with longer follow-up.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine factors predicting appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in a large cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in those age ≤35 years. ICD therapy is offered to select patients at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. Currently, there are no clinical predictors of appropriate ICD therapy in HCM. METHODS: Patients attending the HCM clinic in Sydney, Australia, and who had undergone ICD insertion were included. Baseline data on clinical and ICD characteristics were collected. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 appropriate therapy from the ICD. RESULTS: Of 164 HCM patients included (62% male; mean follow-up, 6 ± 4 years [range, 0 to 19 years]), 21 patients (13%) had at least 1 appropriate therapy. Corrected QT (QTc) interval was the strongest clinical predictor of appropriate ICD therapy (458 ± 30 ms vs. 430 ± 35 ms; p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a 1.2-fold increased likelihood of appropriate therapy per 10-ms increase in QTc, independent of left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) (odds ratio: 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 1.39; p = 0.02) and sex (odds ratio: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.42; p = 0.003). On analysis of cumulative event-free survival from appropriate ICD therapy, the risk for an appropriate ICD therapy in the subgroup with prolonged QT was >3-fold that in the subgroup without prolonged QT, after adjustment for LVWT (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.02 to 9.88; p = 0.047) and sex (hazard ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.22 to 11.41; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that QTc interval prolongation is a novel clinical predictor of appropriate ICD therapy in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The late sodium current inhibitor ranolazine reverses the main electrophysiological and mechanical abnormalities of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cardiomyocytes in vitro, suggesting potential clinical benefit. We aimed to assess the effect of ranolazine on functional capacity, symptomatic status, diastolic function, and arrhythmias in HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 study, 80 adult patients with nonobstructive HCM (age 53±14 years, 34 women) were randomly assigned to placebo (n=40) or ranolazine 1000 mg bid (n=40) for 5 months. The primary end point was change in peak VO2 compared with baseline using cardiopulmonary exercise test. Echocardiographic lateral and septal E/E' ratio, prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, 24-hour Holter arrhythmic profile, and quality of life were assessed. Ranolazine was safe and well tolerated. Overall, there was no significant difference in VO2 peak change at 5 months in the ranolazine versus placebo group (delta 0.15±3.96 versus -0.02±4.25 mL/kg per minute; P=0.832). Ranolazine treatment was associated with a reduction in 24-hour burden of premature ventricular complexes compared with placebo (>50% reduction versus baseline in 61% versus 31%, respectively; P=0.042). However, changes in prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels did not differ in the ranolazine compared with the placebo group (geometric mean median [interquartile range], -3 pg/mL [-107, 142 pg/mL] versus 78 pg/mL [-71, 242 pg/mL]; P=0.251). Furthermore, E/E' ratio and quality of life scores showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nonobstructive HCM, ranolazine showed no overall effect on exercise performance, plasma prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, diastolic function, or quality of life. The drug showed an excellent safety profile and was associated with reduced premature ventricular complex burden. Late sodium current inhibition does not seem to improve functional capacity in HCM.

Limited data exists about the efficacy and clinical outcomes of AF ablation in HCM. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the role of catheter-based ablation for treatment of AF in patients with HCM. METHODS: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies discussing outcomes of catheter-based ablation for AF in patients with HCM. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted relevant data. Incidence rate estimates from individual studies underwent logit transformation to calculate the weighted summary proportion under the random effect model. RESULTS: A total of 19 reports met the inclusion criteria (1183 patients). The single ablation procedure was successful in 39% patients. Up to 34% patients underwent a repeat ablation. About 41% patients in normal sinus rhythm after successful AF ablation received postprocedure antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Patients undergoing successful AF ablation experienced a significant improvement in the New York Heart Association functional class (standardized mean difference -1.03; 95% confidence interval -1.23 to -0.83; P < .00001). CONCLUSION: AF ablation appears to be safe and feasible in patients with HCM. Freedom from AF after undergoing successful ablation is associated with significant improvement in heart failure symptoms.",

        "Abstract Note": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease that can cause left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This study analyzed the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RA) in improving clinical and hemodynamic factors in patients receiving obstructive HCM refractory treatment. This evaluation was necessary because of the small number of studies on the effectiveness of this technique for obstructive HCM in the existing literature. DESIGN: We used the PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct databases to identify randomized clinical trials and observational studies addressing the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes before and after RA in patients with HCM. PARTICIPANTS: We selected six articles published between 2011 and 2022, comprising 304 patients (mean age: 45 years). INTERVENTIONS: We performed a bias assessment using the ROBINS I tool, and meta-analysis processing was performed using the STATA program (v.16.0). RESULTS: The left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient at rest and with stimulation decreased by 58.78 mmHg (p = 0.001) and 70.38 mmHg (total effect Z = 21.62; p < 0.0001), respectively. Additionally, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class decreased by 0.43 (p = 0.001), indicating symptomatic and hemodynamic improvements. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in septal thickness (by 4 mm; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RA improved the NYHA functional class and LVOT gradient at rest and with stimulation and reduced septal thickness. These results suggest that RA is effective in patients refractory to pharmacological therapy and unsuitable for alcohol septal ablation or myectomy. However, more studies, including randomized clinical trials, should be conducted to define the role of RA in interventional therapies.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, improved peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) and lowered resting and Valsalva left ventricular outflow (LVOT) gradients in adults with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) in SEQUOIA-HCM (Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults With Symptomatic oHCM), a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate the effect of aficamten on echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function in SEQUOIA-HCM. METHODS: Serial echocardiograms were performed over 28 weeks in patients randomized to receive placebo or aficamten in up to 4 individually titrated escalating doses (5-20 mg daily) over 24 weeks based on Valsalva LVOT gradients and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). RESULTS: Among 282 patients (mean age 59 ± 13 years; 41% female, 79% White, 19% Asian), mean LVEF was 75% ± 6% with resting and Valsalva LVOT gradients of 55 ± 30 mm Hg and 83 ± 32 mm Hg, respectively. Over 24 weeks, aficamten significantly lowered resting and Valsalva LVOT gradients, and improved left atrial volume index, lateral and septal e' velocities, and lateral and septal E/e' (all P ≤ 0.001). LV end-systolic volume increased and wall thickness decreased (all P ≤ 0.003). Aficamten resulted in a mild reversible decrease in LVEF (-4.8% [95% CI: -6.4% to -3.3%]; P < 0.001) and absolute LV global circumferential strain (-3.7% [95% CI: 1.8%-5.6%]; P < 0.0010), whereas LV global longitudinal strain was unchanged. Several measures, including LVEF, LVOT gradients, and E/e' returned to baseline following washout. Among those treated with aficamten, improved pVO2 and reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were associated with improvement in lateral e' velocity and septal and lateral E/e' (all P < 0.03), whereas improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Scores (KCCQ-CSS) was associated with a decrease in both LVOT gradients (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, patients receiving aficamten demonstrated significant improvement in LVOT gradients and measures of LV diastolic function, and several of these measures were associated with improvements in pVO2, KCCQ-CSS, and NT-proBNP. A modest decrease in LVEF occurred yet remained within normal range. These findings suggest aficamten improved multiple structural and physiological parameters in oHCM without significant adverse changes in LV systolic function.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the impact of surgical myectomy on long-term survival in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction in HCM increases the likelihood of heart failure and cardiovascular death. Although surgical myectomy is the primary treatment for amelioration of outflow obstruction and advanced drug-refractory heart failure symptoms, its impact on long-term survival remains unresolved. METHODS: Total and HCM-related mortality were compared in three subgroups comprised of 1,337 consecutive HCM patients evaluated from 1983 to 2001: 1) surgical myectomy (n = 289); 2) LV outflow obstruction without operation (n = 228); and 3) nonobstructive (n = 820). Mean follow-up duration was 6 +/- 6 years. RESULTS: Including two operative deaths (procedural mortality, 0.8%), 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival after myectomy was 98%, 96%, and 83%, respectively, and did not differ from that of the general U.S. population matched for age and gender (p = 0.2) nor from patients with nonobstructive HCM (p = 0.8). Compared to nonoperated obstructive HCM patients, myectomy patients experienced superior survival free from all-cause mortality (98%, 96%, and 83% vs. 90%, 79%, and 61%, respectively; p < 0.001), HCM-related mortality (99%, 98%, and 95% vs. 94%, 89%, and 73%, respectively; p < 0.001), and sudden cardiac death (100%, 99%, and 99% vs. 97%, 93%, and 89%, respectively; p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed myectomy to have a strong, independent association with survival (hazard ratio 0.43; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical myectomy performed to relieve outflow obstruction and severe symptoms in HCM was associated with long-term survival equivalent to that of the general population, and superior to obstructive HCM without operation. In this retrospective study, septal myectomy seems to reduce mortality risk in severely symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, mavacamten improved exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Mavacamten effects on the primary endpoint, a composite of peak oxygen consumption (VO2 ) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, were greater in patients not receiving background beta-blockers than in those receiving beta-blockers. We sought to determine if the effect of background treatment was consistent across other clinically meaningful parameters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subgroup analyses by beta-blocker use were performed in patients with oHCM from the EXPLORER-HCM and mavacamten long-term extension (MAVA-LTE) studies. In EXPLORER-HCM, 189 patients (75.3%) were receiving beta-blockers, and 62 (24.7%) were receiving non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or no background HCM medication; 170 patients (90.4%) receiving beta-blockers had chronotropic incompetence. Improvements in peak VO2 at week 30 with mavacamten versus placebo were lower with beta-blockers (mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.04 [0.12, 1.95] ml/kg/min) than without beta-blockers (mean difference [95% CI]: 2.69 [1.29, 4.09] ml/kg/min); improvements in non-heart rate-dependent parameters (VE /VCO2 slope) appeared unaffected by beta-blockers. Improvements in functional capacity parameters at week 30 with mavacamten versus placebo were independent of beta-blockade for post-exercise left ventricular outflow tract gradient (mean difference [95% CI]: -37.9 [-48.0, -27.9] mmHg with beta-blockers; -33.5 [-53.6, -13.3] mmHg without beta-blockers), proportion of patients with reduction of ≥1 NYHA class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary scores and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Mavacamten benefits were reproduced and maintained in MAVA-LTE regardless of beta-blockade. CONCLUSION: Mavacamten improved measures of functional capacity, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, symptom burden and biomarkers in patients with HCM regardless of beta-blocker use. Beta-blocker use was often associated with chronotropic incompetence, affecting peak VO2 and other heart rate-dependent measures, but had minimal impact on heart rate-independent measures.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: There is little information regarding long-term mortality comparing the 2 most common procedures for septal reduction for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), alcohol septal ablation (ASA), and septal myectomy. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare the long-term mortality of patients with obstructive HCM following septal myectomy or ASA. METHODS: We evaluated outcomes of 3,859 patients who underwent ASA or septal myectomy in 3 specialized HCM centers. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint of the study. RESULTS: In the study cohort, 585 (15.2%) patients underwent ASA, and 3,274 (84.8%) underwent septal myectomy. Patients undergoing ASA were significantly older (median age: 63.0 years [IQR: 52.7-72.8 years] vs 53.7 years [IQR: 44.9-62.8 years]; P < 0.001) and had smaller septal thickness (19.0 mm [IQR: 17.0-22.0 mm] vs 20.0 mm [IQR: 17.0-23.0 mm]; P = 0.007). Patients undergoing ASA also had more comorbidities, including renal failure, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. There were 4 (0.7%) early deaths in the ASA group and 9 (0.3%) in the myectomy group. Over a median follow-up of 6.4 years (IQR: 3.6-10.2 years), the 10-year all-cause mortality rate was 26.1% in the ASA group and 8.2% in the myectomy group. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, the mortality remained greater in patients having septal reduction by ASA (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.29-2.19; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ASA is associated with increased long-term all-cause mortality compared with septal myectomy. This impact on survival is independent of other known factors but may be influenced by unmeasured confounding patient characteristics.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who warrant a primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is crucial. ICDs are effective in terminating life-threatening arrhythmias; however, ICDs carry risks of complications. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and predictors of appropriate ICD therapies, inappropriate shocks, and device-related complications in patients with HCM and primary prevention ICDs. METHODS: All patients with HCM who underwent primary prevention ICD implantation at Toronto General Hospital between September 2000 and December 2017 were identified. Therapies (shocks or antitachycardia pacing) for ventricular tachycardia >180 beats/min or ventricular fibrillation were considered appropriate. RESULTS: Three hundred two patients were followed for a mean 6.1 ± 4.3 years (1801 patient-years of follow-up). Thirty-eight patients (12.6%) received at least 1 appropriate ICD therapy (2.3%/y); the 5-year cumulative probability of receiving appropriate ICD therapy was 9.6%. None of the conventional risk factors nor the European Society of Cardiology risk score was associated with appropriate ICD therapy. In multivariable analysis, age < 40 years at implantation and atrial fibrillation were independent predictors of appropriate ICD therapy. In a subgroup of patients who had undergone cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before ICD implantation, severe late gadolinium enhancement was the strongest predictor of appropriate ICD therapies. ICD-related complications or inappropriate shocks occurred in 87 patients (28.8%), with an inappropriate shock rate of 2.1%/y; the 5-year cumulative probability was 10.7%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of appropriate ICD therapies in patients with HCM and primary prevention ICDs is lower than previously reported; a high proportion of patients suffer from an ICD-related complication. Traditional risk factors have low predictive utility. Severe late gadolinium enhancement, atrial fibrillation, and young age are important predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Professional society practice guidelines conflict regarding their recommendations of dofetilide (DOF) and sotalol (STL) for treatment of arrhythmias in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and supporting data is sparse. We aim to assess safety and efficacy of DOF and STL on arrhythmias in HCM. METHODS: This was an observational study of HCM patients treated with DOF or STL for atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Outcomes of drug discontinuation and arrhythmia recurrence were compared at 1 year and latest follow-up by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Predictors of drug failure were studied using uni- and multi-variable analyses. Drug-related adverse events were quantitated. RESULTS: Here we show that of our cohort of 72 patients (54 ± 14 years old, 75% male), 21 were prescribed DOF for AF, 52 STL for AF, and 18 STL for VA. At 1 year, discontinuation and recurrence rates were similar for DOF-AF (38% and 43%) and STL-AF (29% and 44%) groups. Efficacy data was similar at long-term follow-up of 1603 (IQR 994-4131) days, and for STL-VA. Drug inefficacy was the most common reason for discontinuation (28%) followed by side-effects (13%). Incidences of heart failure hospitalization (5%) and mortality (3%) were low. One STL-AF patient developed non-sustained torsades de pointes in the setting of severe pneumonia and acute kidney injury, but there were no other drug-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: DOF and STL demonstrate modest efficacy and satisfactory safety when used for AF and VA in HCM patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of \"malignant\" mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: Previous genotype-phenotype studies have implicated four mutations (R403Q, R453C, G716R and R719W) as highly malignant defects in the beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7). In the cardiac troponin T gene (TNNT2), a specific mutation (R92W) has been associated with high risk of sudden death. Routine clinical screening for these malignant mutations has been suggested to identify high-risk individuals. METHODS: We screened 293 unrelated individuals with HCM seen at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between April 1997 and October 2000. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was obtained after informed consent; amplification of MYH7 exons 13 (R403Q), 14 (R453C) and 19 (G716R and R719W), and TNNT2 exon 9 (R92W) was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The mutations were detected using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automated DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 42 years with 53 patients diagnosed before age 25. The mean maximal left ventricular wall thickness was 21 mm. Nearly one-third of cases were familial and one-fourth had a family history of sudden cardiac death. Only 3 of the 293 patients possessed one of the five \"malignant\" mutations, and all 3 patients were <25 years of age at presentation (p < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This finding underscores the profound genetic heterogeneity in HCM. Only 1% of unrelated individuals seen at a tertiary referral center for HCM possessed one of the five \"malignant\" mutations that were examined. Routine clinical testing for these specific mutations is of low yield.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Troponin (TNN)-encoded cardiac troponins (Tn) are critical for sensing calcium and triggering myofilament contraction. TNN variants are associated with development of cardiomyopathy; however, recent advances in genetic analysis have identified rare population variants. It is unclear how certain variants are associated with disease while others are tolerated. OBJECTIVE: To compare probands with TNNT2, TNNI3, and TNNC1 variants and utilize high-resolution variant comparison mapping of pathologic and rare population variants to identify loci associated with disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Cardiomyopathy-associated TNN variants were identified in the literature and topology mapping conducted. Clinical features were compiled and compared. Rare population variants were obtained from the gnomAD database. Signal-to-noise (S:N) normalized pathologic variant frequency against population variant frequency. Abstract review of clinical phenotypes was applied to \"significant\" hot spots. RESULTS: Probands were compiled (N = 70 studies, 224 probands) as were rare variants (N = 125,748 exomes; 15,708 genomes, MAF <0.001). TNNC1-positive probands demonstrated the youngest age of presentation (20.0 years; P = .016 vs TNNT2; P = .004 vs TNNI3) and the highest death, transplant, or ventricular fibrillation events (P = .093 vs TNNT2; P = .024 vs TNNI3; Kaplan Meir: P = .025). S:N analysis yielded hot spots of diagnostic significance within the tropomyosin-binding domains, α-helix 1, and the N-Terminus in TNNT2 with increased sudden cardiac death and ventricular fibrillation (P = .004). The inhibitory region and C-terminal region in TNNI3 exhibited increased restrictive cardiomyopathy (P =.008). HCM and RCM models tended to have increased calcium sensitivity and DCM decreased sensitivity (P < .001). DCM and HCM studies typically showed no differences in Hill coefficient which was decreased in RCM models (P < .001). CM models typically demonstrated no changes to Fmax (P = .239). CONCLUSION: TNNC1-positive probands had younger ages of diagnosis and poorer clinical outcomes. Mapping of TNN variants identified locations in TNNT2 and TNNI3 associated with heightened pathogenicity, RCM diagnosis, and increased risk of sudden death.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited disease, with a prevalence of 1:200 worldwide. The cause of HCM usually presents with an autosomal dominant mutation in the genes encoding one of more than 20 sarcomeric proteins, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity. HCM classically manifests as an unexplained thickness of the interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricular (LV) walls, with or without the obstruction of the LV outflow tract (LVOT), and variable cardiac arrhythmias. Here, we present a rare case of mixed cardiomyopathy (cardiac hypertrophy and dilation) and erythrocytosis in a young patient. A 27-year-old man was admitted to the clinic due to biventricular heart failure (HF) NYHA class III. Personal medical records included a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) since the age of 4 years and were, at the time, considered an outcome of myocarditis. Severe respiratory infection led to circulatory decompensation and acute femoral thrombosis. The combination of non-obstructive LV hypertrophy (LV walls up to 15 mm), LV dilatation, decreased contractility (LV EF 24%), and LV apical thrombosis were seen. Cardiac MRI showed a complex pattern of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) revealed primary cardiomyopathy with intravascular coagulation and an inflammatory response. No viral genome was detected in the plasma or EMB samples. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygous in-frame deletion p.2711_2737del in the MyBPC3 gene. The clinically unaffected mother was a heterozygous carrier of this deletion, and the father was unavailable for clinical and genetic testing. Essential erythrocytosis remains unexplained. No significant improvement was achieved by conventional treatment, including prednisolone 40 mg therapy. ICD was implanted due to sustained VT and high risk of SCD. Orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx) was considered optimal. Early manifestation combined hypertrophic and dilated phenotype, and progression may reflect a complex genotype with more than one pathogenic allele and/or a combination of genetic diseases in one patient.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited heart disease, is frequently caused by mutations in the β-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7). Abnormal calcium handling and diastolic dysfunction are archetypical features of HCM caused by MYH7 gene mutations. However, the mechanism of how MYH7 mutations leads to these features remains unclear, which inhibits the development of effective therapies. Initially, cardiomyocytes were generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from an eight-year-old girl diagnosed with HCM carrying a MYH7(C.1063 G>A) heterozygous mutation(mutant-iPSC-CMs) and mutation-corrected isogenic iPSCs(control-iPSC-CMs) in the present study. Next, we compared phenotype of mutant-iPSC-CMs to that of control-iPSC-CMs, by assessing their morphology, hypertrophy-related genes expression, calcium handling, diastolic function and myofilament calcium sensitivity at days 15 and 40 respectively. Finally, to better understand increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity as a central mechanism of central pathogenicity in HCM, inhibition of calcium sensitivity with mavacamten can improveed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mutant-iPSC-CMs exhibited enlarged areas, increased sarcomere disarray, enhanced expression of hypertrophy-related genes proteins, abnormal calcium handling, diastolic dysfunction and increased myofilament calcium sensitivity at day 40, but only significant increase in calcium sensitivity and mild diastolic dysfunction at day 15. Increased calcium sensitivity by levosimendan aggravates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy phenotypes such as expression of hypertrophy-related genes, abnormal calcium handling and diastolic dysfunction, while inhibition of calcium sensitivity significantly improves cardiomyocyte hypertrophy phenotypes in mutant-iPSC-CMs, suggesting increased myofilament calcium sensitivity is the primary mechanisms for MYH7 mutations pathogenesis. Our studies have uncovered a pathogenic mechanism of HCM caused by MYH7 gene mutations through which enhanced myofilament calcium sensitivity aggravates abnormal calcium handling and diastolic dysfunction. Correction of the myofilament calcium sensitivity was found to be an effective method for treating the development of HCM phenotype in vitro.",

        "Abstract Note": "Although several genes or genetic loci that are either responsible for or confer susceptibility to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have been identified, genetic defects that underlie nonfamilial HCM or DCM remain to be characterized. An allelic association study for the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen genes has now been performed with 71 patients with nonfamilial HCM, 88 patients with nonfamilial DCM, and 122 healthy control subjects in the Japanese population. The distribution of ACE genotypes for an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16 did not differ significantly among control subjects and patients with HCM or DCM. Similarly, the distributions of angiotensinogen genotypes for methionine-235-threonine (M235T) and threonine-174-methionine (T174M) polymorphisms did not differ significantly among the three groups. Echocardiographic parameters that are indicators of the severity or progression of disease did not differ significantly among ACE I/D or angiotensinogen M235T and T174M genotypes in the two patient groups. Finally, no additive or synergistic effect of any combined genotypes or haplotypes of the ACE and angiotensinogen polymorphisms on the association with HCM or DCM was detected. Results indicate that the ACE I/D and angiotensinogen M235T and T174M polymorphisms are not related to HCM or DCM in the Japanese population, and that variants of these polymorphisms do not contribute to the genesis or progression of these cardiomyopathies.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. However, other genetic and possibly also environmental factors modify the phenotypic expression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The present study investigated whether cardiac adrenergic activity affects the severity of LV hypertrophy in genetically identical patients with HCM. METHODS: The study population consisted of 21 patients with HCM caused by the Asp175Asn substitution of the alpha-tropomyosin gene (TPM1-Asp175Asn) and 9 healthy volunteers. LV mass and segmental wall thickness were measured with MRI. Presynaptic cardiac adrenergic activity was measured with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) SPECT. Global and segmental washouts of (123)I-MIBG were calculated. RESULTS: Global myocardial (123)I-MIBG washout was faster in patients with TPM1-Asp175Asn than in healthy volunteers (50% +/- 9% vs. 37% +/- 8%, P = 0.001). In linear regression analysis, global (123)I-MIBG washout was associated with the LV mass index and LV maximal wall thickness index in HCM patients (r = 0.512, P = 0.018, and r = 0.478, P = 0.028, respectively). The mean (123)I-MIBG washout was higher in LV segments >/= 15 mm thick than in LV segments < 15 mm thick (56 +/- 10 vs. 49% +/- 10%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In patients with HCM sharing the same causal gene defect, the degree of LV hypertrophy is related to (123)I-MIBG washout, suggesting that cardiac adrenergic activity modifies phenotypic expression in HCM.",

Genetic diagnosis is challenging in these complex diseases but exome sequencing as a genetic diagnostic tool provides explainable results. METHODS: In a familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with multigenerational inheritance with apparent phenotype, had a history of sudden death and severe arrhythmia followed by implantation of Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Exome sequencing (100×) trailed by effective filtering steps for exome variants on the basis of different parameters, segregated variants are prioritized for the disease and further clinical relevance are evaluated for the variants. RESULTS: A rare causal variant in troponin-T gene (TNNT2, NM_000364.3;c.274C > T;p.Arg92Trp) is identified, shared by only affected members, absent in unaffected members and also in 200 unrelated control chromosomes. TNNT2 mutation act as a driver mutation but mutations in other disease-related genes, KCNMB1, LPL, APOE and other biochemical factors provides risk stratification within affected family members. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the role of \"rare variants\" in complex disease phenotypes and heterogeneity within family and the necessity of whole exome targeted approaches in complex cardiomyopathy, which are known to harbor private mutations.",

        "Abstract Note": "There is an overlap between the physiological cardiac remodeling associated with training in athletes, the so-called athlete's heart, and mild forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common hereditary cardiac disease. HCM is often accompanied by unfavorable outcomes including a sudden cardiac death in the adolescents. Because one of the initial signs of HCM is abnormality in electrocardiogram (ECG), athletes may need to monitor for ECG findings to prevent any unfavorable outcomes. HCM is caused by mutations in genes for sarcomere proteins, but there is no report on the systematic screening of gene mutations in athletes. One hundred and two genetically unrelated young Japanese athletes with abnormal ECG findings were the subjects for the analysis of four sarcomere genes, MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2 and TNNI3. We found that 5 out of 102 (4.9%) athletes carried mutations: a heterozygous MYH7 Glu935Lys mutation, a heterozygous MYBPC3 Arg160Trp mutation and another heterozygous MYBPC3 Thr1046Met mutation, all of which had been reported as HCM-associated mutations, in 1, 2 and 2 subjects, respectively. This is the first study of systematic screening of sarcomere gene mutations in a cohort of athletes with abnormal ECG, demonstrating the presence of sarcomere gene mutations in the athlete's heart.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and spectrum of mutations in both genes in German HCM and DCM patients and to establish novel genotype-to-phenotype correlations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Coding exons and intron flanks of the two genes MYH7 and MYBPC3 of 236 patients with HCM and 652 patients with DCM were sequenced by conventional and array-based means. Clinical records were established following standard protocols. Mutations were detected in 41 and 11% of the patients with HCM and DCM, respectively. Differences were observed in the frequency of splice site and frame-shift mutations in the gene MYBPC3, which occurred more frequently (P< 0.02, P< 0.001, respectively) in HCM than in DCM, suggesting that cardiac myosin-binding protein C haploinsufficiency predisposes to hypertrophy rather than to dilation. Additional novel genotype-to-phenotype correlations were found in HCM, among these a link between MYBPC3 mutations and a particularly large thickness of the interventricular septum (P= 0.04 vs. carriers of a mutation in MYH7). Interestingly, this correlation and a link between MYH7 mutations and a higher degree of mitral valve regurgitation held true for both HCM and DCM, indicating that the gene affected by a mutation may determine the magnitude of structural and functional alterations in both HCM and DCM. CONCLUSION: A large clinical-genetic study has unravelled novel genotype-to-phenotype correlations in HCM and DCM which warrant future investigation of both the underlying mechanisms and the prognostic use.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The correlations between genotype and phenotype in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been established. Mutation of α-actin gene (ACTC1) is a rare cause of HCM. This study aimed to explore novel genotype-phenotype correlations in HCM patients with the variants in ACTC1 and myosin-binding protein (MYBPC3) genes in three unrelated Chinese families. METHODS: Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic examinations were performed in three Han pedigrees. Exon and boarding intron analysis of 96 cardio-disease-related genes was performed using second-generation sequencing on three probands. The candidate variants were validated in 14 available family members and 300 unrelated healthy controls by bi-directional Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity and conservation were calculated using MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and Clustal X. Pathogenicity classification of the variants was based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. RESULTS: Nine members fulfilled diagnostic criteria for HCM with clinical characteristics, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic findings. Two candidate variants in ACTC1 p.Asp26Asn (ACTC1-D26N) and MYBPC3 p.Arg215Cys (MYBPC3-R215C) were identified in patients. Only ACTC1-D26N strongly co-segregated with the HCM phenotype. Seven patients who harbored variant ACTC-D26N only were diagnosed with non-obstructive HCM, and four of these patients exhibited a triphasic left ventricular (LV) filling pattern. Two patients carrying both ACTC1-D26N and MYBPC3-R215C variants showed a higher LV outflow tract pressure gradient. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the two variants were deleterious and highly conserved across species. According to ACMG guidelines, ACTC1-D26N is classified as a likely pathogenic mutation. The second variation MYBPC3-R215C may function as a genetic modifier, which remains uncertain here. CONCLUSIONS: Novel p.(Asp26Asn) mutation of ACTC1 was associated with HCM phenotype, and the penetrance is extremely high (∼81.8%) in adults. The second variation, MYBPC3-R215C may function as a genetic modifier, which remains uncertain here.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heart disorder caused by autosomal dominant alterations affecting both sarcomeric genes and other nonsarcomeric loci in a minority of cases. However, in some patients, the occurrence of the causal pathogenic variant or variants in homozygosity, compound heterozygosity, or double heterozygosity has also been described. Most of the HCM pathogenic variants are missense and unique, but truncating mutations of the MYBPC3 gene have been reported as founder pathogenic variants in populations from Finland, France, Japan, Iceland, Italy, and the Netherlands. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the genetic background of HCM in a cohort of Polish patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty‑nine Polish patients were analyzed by a next generation sequencing panel including 404 cardiovascular genes. RESULTS: Pathogenic variants were found in 41% of the patients, with ultra‑ rare MYBPC3 c.2541C>G (p.Tyr847Ter) mutation standing for a variant hotspot and correlating with a lower age at HCM diagnosis. Among the nonsarcomeric genes, the CSRP3 mutation was found in a single case carrying the novel c.364C>T (p.Arg122Ter) variant in homozygosity. With this finding, the total number of known HCM cases with human CSRP3 knockout cases has reached 3. CONCLUSIONS: This report expands the mutational spectrum and the inheritance pattern of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Although the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can affect the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, few data exist regarding the relationships between RAS polymorphisms and alteration of LV function. The effect of RAS polymorphisms on LV function in genotyped hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was examined in the present study. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group comprised 126 carriers with sarcomere gene mutations from 49 HCM families (64 males, mean age 51±21 years). LV morphology and function were evaluated by echocardiography. In angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D), the D allele (n=81) exhibited significantly larger LV end-systolic dimension (LVDs) (32±11mm) and lower ejection fraction (56±15%) than those with the II genotype (28±7mm and 62±12%, respectively, P<0.05; n=45). Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) A/C(1166) polymorphism did not affect echocardiographic parameters, the presence of the ACE D allele with the AT(1)-R C(1166) allele (n=9) was associated with larger LVDs (37±17mm) and lower ejection fraction (48±20%) compared with other genotypes (30±9mm and 58±14%, respectively, P<0.05; n=117). Under these conditions, severe LV hypertrophy was frequently associated with LV wall thinning. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of both the ACE D and AT(1)-R C(1166) allele is associated with LV dilation with systolic dysfunction in genotyped HCM. In addition to the severity of LV hypertrophy, screening for these RAS polymorphisms could contribute to further risk stratification of patients with HCM, although other genetic polymorphisms should be further examined.",

The anterior walls and interventricular septa of their hearts were replaced with extensive fibrosis and showed thinning. Myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, and thickened medial walls of the intramural coronary arteries were found.

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the deletion/insertion (D/I) polymorphism in the ACE-encoded angiotensin-converting enzyme or the pooled gene effect of five renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) polymorphisms were disease modifiers in a large cohort of unrelated patients with genotyped hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Five different RAAS polymorphism genotypes were established by PCR amplification of the surrounding polymorphic regions of genomic DNA in a cohort of 389 unrelated patients comprehensively genotyped for HCM-causing mutations in eight sarcomeric/myofilament genes. Patient clinical data were archived in a database blinded both to the primary myofilament defect and the polymorphism genotype. Each patient was assessed with respect to ACE genotype as well as composite pro-left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) RAAS polymorphism score (0-5). Overall, no clinical parameter correlated independently with ACE genotype. Subset analysis of the two most common genetic subtypes of HCM, MYBPC3 (myosin binding protein C) and MYH7 (beta myosin heavy chain), demonstrated a significant pro-LVH effect of DD-ACE only in patients with MYBPC3-HCM. In MYBPC3-HCM, left ventricular wall thickness was greater in patients with DD genotype (25.8+/-5 mm) compared with DI (21.8+/-4) or II genotype (20.8+/-5, P=0.01). Moreover, extreme hypertrophy (>30 mm) was only seen in MYBPC3-HCM patients who also hosted DD-ACE. An effect of RAAS pro-LVH score was evident only in the subgroup of patients with no previously identified myofilament mutation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that RAAS genotypes may modify the clinical phenotype of HCM in a disease gene-specific fashion rather than indiscriminately.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease of the cardiac sarcomere, caused by numerous mutations in genes encoding protein components of this structure. Mutation carriers are at risk of sudden cardiac death, mostly as adolescents or young adults. The reproductive disadvantage incurred may explain both the global occurrence of diverse independent HCM-associated mutations and the rare reports of founder effects within populations. We have investigated whether this holds true for two South African subpopulations, one of mixed ancestry and one of northern-European descent. Previously, we had detected three novel mutations-Ala797Thr in the beta-myosin heavy-chain gene (betaMHC), Arg92Trp in the cardiac troponin T gene (cTnT), and Arg645His in the myosin-binding protein C gene (MyBPC)-and two documented betaMHC mutations (Arg403Trp and Arg249Gln). Here we report three additional novel mutations-Gln499Lys in betaMHC and Val896Met and Deltac756 in MyBPC-and the documented betaMHC Arg719Gln mutation. Seven of the nine HCM-causing mutations arose independently; no conclusions can be drawn for the remaining two. However, the betaMHC Arg403Trp and Ala797Thr and cTnT Arg92Trp mutations were detected in another one, eight, and four probands, respectively, and haplotype analysis in families carrying these recurring mutations inferred their origin from three common ancestors. The milder phenotype of the betaMHC mutations may account for the presence of these founder effects, whereas population dynamics alone may have overridden the reproductive disadvantage incurred by the more lethal, cTnT Arg92Trp mutation.",

        "Abstract Note": "MYPBC3 and MYH7 are the most frequently mutated genes in patients with hereditary HCM. Homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes generate the most severe phenotypes. A 35-year-old woman who was a homozygous carrier of the p.(Pro1066Arg) variant in the MYBPC3 gene, developed HCM phenocopy associated with left ventricular noncompaction and various degrees of conduction disease. Her father, a double heterozygote for this variant in MYBPC3 combined with the variant p.(Gly1931Cys) in the MYH7 gene, was affected by HCM. The variant in MYBPC3 in the heterozygosis-produced phenotype was neither in the mother nor in her only sister. Familial segregation analysis showed that the homozygous genotype p.(Pro1066Arg) was located in a region of 26 Mb loss of heterozygosity due to some consanguinity in the parents. These findings describe the pathogenicity of this variant, supporting the hypothesis of cumulative variants in cardiomyopathies, as well as the modulatory effect of the phenotype by other genes such as MYH7. Advancing HPO phenotyping promoted by the Human Phenotype Ontology, the gene-disease correlation, and vice versa, is evidence for the phenotypic heterogeneity of familial heart disease. The progressive establishment of phenotypic characteristics over time also complicates the clinical description.",

Three mis-sense mutations of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene, MYH7, were found: valine (Val) 606 methionine (Met), arginine (Arg) 694 leucine (Leu), and Arg 723 glycine (Gly). All are reported here for the first time in Chinese subjects. The results showed that: Val606Met is an intermediate malignancy mutation; Arg694Leu is a novel mutation with a benign phenotype; and the Arg723Gly mutation is linked to malignancy - it can lead not only to HCM but also to dilated cardiomyopathy at various ages. The clinical symptoms associated with Arg723Gly emerged early and caused more severe clinical manifestation and poorer prognosis in females than in males. Mis-sense mutations were not detected in the myosin binding protein C, cardiac, cardiac troponin T type 2, or cardiac troponin I type 3 genes. The MYH7 gene may be an HCM mutation hotspot in the Chinese and have unique features in this study population.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be demonstrated during adulthood in genetically affected relatives with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous cardiac disease caused by mutations in nine genes that encode proteins of the sarcomere. Mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) gene have been associated with age-related penetrance. METHODS: To further analyze dormancy of LVH in patients with HCM, we studied, using echocardiography and 12-lead electrocardiography, the phenotypic expression caused by MyBPC mutations in seven genotyped pedigrees. RESULTS: Of 119 family members studied, 61 were identified with a MyBPC mutation, including 21 genetically affected relatives (34%) who did not express the HCM morphologic phenotype (by virtue of showing normal left ventricular wall thickness). Of these 21 phenotype-negative individuals, 9 were children, presumably in the prehypertrophic phase, and 12 were adults. Of the 12 adults with normal wall thickness < or = 12 mm (7 also with normal electrocardiograms), 5 subsequently underwent serial echocardiography prospectively over four to six years. Of note, three of these five adults showed development of LVH in mid-life, appearing for the first time at 33, 34 and 42 years of age, respectively, not associated with outflow obstruction or significant symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with HCM, disease-causing MyBPC mutations are not uncommonly associated with absence of LVH on echocardiogram. Delayed remodeling with the development of LVH appearing de novo in adulthood, demonstrated here for the first time in individual patients with prospectively obtained serial echocardiograms, substantiates the principle of age-related penetrance for MyBPC mutations in HCM. These observations alter prevailing perceptions regarding the HCM clinical spectrum and family screening strategies and further characterize the evolution of LVH in this disease.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mainly results from autosomal-dominant inherited single heterozygous mutations in cardiac sarcomere genes. Contributions of multiple gene mutations to disease heterogeneity in a three-generation family were investigated. METHODS: Clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG), and echocardiographic examination in members of a three-generation Chinese family was followed by exon and boarding intron analysis of 96 genes in the proband using second-generation sequencing. The identified mutations were confirmed by bi-directional Sanger sequencing in all family members and 300 healthy controls. RESULTS: Four missense mutations were detected in the family. These were two novel MYH7-H1717Q and MYLK2-K324E mutations accompanied by the KCNQ1-R190W and TMEM70-I147T mutations. The proband carried all four mutations and showed overlapping HCM and LQT1 phenotypes. Five family members each carried two mutations. Subject II-2 only carried TMEM70-I147T. MYH7-H1717Q and TMEM70-I147T came from the paternal side, whereas KCNQ1-R190W and MYLK2-K324E came from the maternal side. Left ventricle mass indices in MYH7-H1717Q carriers were significantly higher than in non-H1717Q carriers (90.05 ± 7.33 g/m(2), 63.20 ± 4.53 g/m(2), respectively, P < 0.01). Four KCNQ1-R190W carriers showed QTc intervals that were significantly more prolonged than those in non-R190W carriers (472.25 ± 16.18 and 408.50 ± 7.66 ms, respectively, P < 0.05). All MYLK2-K324E carriers showed inverted ECG T waves. The subject with only a TMEM70-I147T mutation showed normal ECG and echocardiographs, suggesting that this had less pathological effects at least in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate dual LQT1 and HCM phenotypes in this multiple LQT1- and HCM-related gene mutation carrier family for the first time and suggest that LQT-related gene mutations associate with QT interval prolongation and/or arrhythmia in HCM patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disease of the sarcomere characterised clinically by myocardial hypertrophy and its consequences. Phenotypic expression is heterogeneous even within families with the same aetiological mutation and may be influenced by additional genetic factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on ECG and two dimensional echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in genetically identical patients with HCM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polymorphisms of five RAAS components were determined in 26 gene carriers from a single family with HCM caused by a previously identified myosin binding protein C mutation. Genotypes associated with a higher activation status of the RAAS were labelled \"pro-LVH genotypes\". RESULTS: There was a non-biased distribution of pro-LVH genotypes in the gene carriers. Those without pro-LVH genotypes did not manifest cardiac hypertrophy whereas gene carriers with pro-LVH genotypes did (mean (SD) left ventricular muscle mass 190 (48) v 320 (113), p = 0.002; interventricular septal thickness 11.5 (2.0) v 16.4 (6.7), p = 0.01; pathological ECG 0% (0 of 10) v 63% (10 of 16), respectively). Multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, and hypertension confirmed an independent association between the presence of pro-LVH polymorphisms and left ventricular mass. When each polymorphism was assessed individually, carriers of each pro-LVH genotype had a significantly greater left ventricular mass than those with no pro-LVH mutation; these associations, with the exception of cardiac chymase A AA polymorphism (p = 0.06), remained significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms of the RAAS influence penetrance and degree of LVH in 26 gene carriers from one family with HCM caused by a myosin binding protein C mutation.",

        "Abstract Note": "The clinical course and prognosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are different according to the type of mutation in the genes for sarcomere proteins. It has been disputed that a mutation, which occurs at a functionally important region in the sarcomere proteins, may increase the penetrance and expressivity of the disease. We searched for a causative mutation in an HCM family, which is characterized by early expression of clinical phenotype, high incidence of sudden death at young ages, and progressive heart failure in adults. Among the 32 family members in 4 generations, 13 were affected; 4 died suddenly before age 16, 2 children have already had full expression of the cardiac hypertrophy, and other adults have either progressive heart failure or poor left ventricular systolic functions. PCR-SSCP (polymerase chain reaction-single strand confirmation polymorphism) analysis of genomic DNAs isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of the family members identified a Gly716Arg mutation in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene, which was cosegregated with the clinical phenotype. The mutation is localized near a functionally important site of the myosin heavy chain, the 2 active thiols, which contribute to the adenosine triphosphatase activity of myosin S1. This family provides further evidence that the mutation, which occurs at a functionally important site of the myosin heavy chain, is associated with the high penetrance and early expression of HCM.",

However, two prevalent founder mutations for HCM in the alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1-D175N) and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3-Q1061X) genes have previously been identified in eastern Finland. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of these founder mutations in a large population of patients with HCM from all over Finland. Patients and methods. We screened for two founder mutations (TPM1-D175N and MYBPC3-Q1061X) in 306 unrelated Finnish patients with HCM from the regions covering a population of ∼4,000,000. RESULTS: The TPM1-D175N mutation was found in 20 patients (6.5%) and the MYBPC3-Q1061X in 35 patients (11.4%). Altogether, the two mutations accounted for 17.9% of the HCM cases. In addition, 61 and 59 relatives of the probands were found to be carriers of TPM1-D175N and MYBPC3-Q1061X, respectively. The mutations showed regional clustering. TPM1-D175N was prevalent in central and western Finland, and MYBPC3-Q1061X in central and eastern Finland. CONCLUSION: The TPM1-D175N and MYBPC3-Q1061X mutations account for a substantial part of all HCM cases in the Finnish population, indicating that routine genetic screening of these mutations is warranted in Finnish patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Objectives: To identify previously unrecognized genetic variants and clinical variables associated with the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases 10)-based diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the UK Biobank cohort. Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiovascular disorder with more than 2000 known mutations in one of eight genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. However, there is considerable variation in disease manifestation, suggesting the role of additional unrecognized contributors, genetic and otherwise. There is substantial interest in the use of real-world data, such as electronic health records to better understand disease mechanisms and discover new treatment strategies, but whether ICD-10-based diagnosis can be used to study HCM genetics is unknown. Methods: In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the UK Biobank, we analyzed the genomes of 363 individuals diagnosed with HCM based on ICD-10 coding compared to 7,260 age, ancestry, and sex-matched controls in a 1:20 case:control design. Genetic variants were analyzed by Plink's firth logistic regression and assessed for association with HCM. We also examined 61 biomarkers and other diagnoses in the 363 HCM cases and matched controls. Results: The prevalence of ICD-10-based diagnosis of HCM in the UK Biobank cohort was 1 in 1,342, suggesting disease assignment based on the two ICD-10 codes underestimates HCM prevalence. In addition, common cardiovascular comorbidities were more prevalent in ICD-10-based HCM cases in comparison to controls. We identified two novel, non-sarcomeric genetic variants in KMT2C rs78630626, and PARD3B rs188937806 that were associated with ICD-10 codes for HCM with genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10-8). These are associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) of ∼3.8 for being diagnosed with HCM. Minor allele frequency (MAF) of each variant was >1%. Discussion: Disease assignment based strictly on ICD-10 codes may underestimate HCM prevalence. Individuals with HCM were more frequently diagnosed with several comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, diabetes, and kidney failure, suggesting they may contribute to disease manifestation. This UK Biobank database-based GWAS identified common variants in KMT2C and PARD3B that are associated with HCM diagnosis, which may represent novel modifier genes. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and limitations of conducting phenotypic and genotypic characterization of HCM based on ICD-10 diagnosis in a large population-based cohort.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The disease gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been identified as the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) gene in some HCM families. We describe extensive clinical evaluations in two kindreds with two distinct point mutations in the beta-MHC gene. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) gel analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products capturing each of the 40 beta-MHC gene exons to identify distinct missense mutations in two HCM kindreds. Clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic studies were performed in the two kindreds: kindred 2755 with amino acid 908Leu----Val mutation and kindred 2002 with amino acid 403Arg----Gln mutation. The morphological appearances of HCM were similar in these two kindreds. However, the two kindreds differed with respect to disease penetrance, age of onset of disease, and incidence of premature sudden death. Twelve of 31 adults (greater than or equal to 17 years) with the disease gene in kindred 2755 did not have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and only five of these had ECG abnormalities. Thus, the disease penetrance in adults with this mutation was only 61%. None of 11 children aged less than 16 years had LVH. The 908 mutation was associated with a low incidence of cardiac events: Only two sudden deaths and one syncope occurred in 46 individuals with the mutant allele. In contrast, LVH was present in all 11 adults in kindred 2002 with the 403 mutation (100% disease penetrance). In addition, three of four affected children were symptomatic and had clinical evidence of HCM. The disease in this kindred was severe and resulted in six premature sudden deaths. Seven additional patients had syncope or presyncope. CONCLUSIONS: In some kindreds, the HCM disease gene is more prevalent than indicated by echocardiography and ECG. Some point mutations may be associated with a more malignant prognosis. Preclinical identification of children with mutations associated with a high incidence of sudden death and syncope provides the opportunity to evaluate efficacy of early therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract Note": "Plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) acts as a key defense against oxidative stress by hydrolyzing PAF and oxidized phospholipids. Deficiency of the activity of this enzyme may thus potentially result in predisposition to myocardial damage. The possible role of the G994 (V allele) --> T (F allele) polymorphism of the PAF-AH gene in modulating cardiac function was investigated in 142 Japanese subjects with nonfamilial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, height, and body weight revealed that the frequency of the F allele was significantly higher in HCM patients than in 284 healthy controls. Echocardiographic examination revealed that left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were significantly greater in HCM patients with the FF genotype than in those with the VV genotype. Cardiac catheterization revealed that LV end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher, whereas the LV ejection fraction was significantly smaller, for HCM patients with the F allele than for those with the VV genotype. Interstitial fibrosis was significantly more severe in HCM subjects with the FF genotype than in those with the VV genotype. These results suggest that the G994 --> T (Val279 --> Phe) polymorphism in the plasma PAF-AH gene may exacerbate cardiac damage in Japanese individuals with nonfamilial HCM, although this polymorphism is unlikely to be a causative factor for this condition.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: A few studies reported that some mutations in the cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) gene were associated with dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (D-HCM) resembling dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We studied 5 unrelated cardiomyopathy probands caused by an identical mutation in the MyBPC gene. The results of clinical and genetic investigations in these patients are presented in this paper. METHODS: We analyzed MyBPC gene in DCM patients as well as patients with HCM. RESULTS: An R945fs/105 mutation, 2-base deletion at nucleotides 18,535 and 18,536, was identified in 4 of the 176 HCM probands and in 1 of the 54 DCM probands. Genetic analysis in relatives of those probands revealed another one member with this mutation. A total of 6 subjects had R945fs/105 mutation. The mean age of these six patients at diagnosis was 61 years. At initial evaluation, three of them were diagnosed as having HCM with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function. The other two patients already had D-HCM. The remaining one patient was diagnosed as having DCM because of reduced LV systolic function (ejection fraction=31%) without increased LV wall thickness. During follow-up (7.6 years), all three patients with impaired LV systolic function were admitted for treatment of heart failure and/or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Finally, one patient with the diagnosis of D-HCM died of heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with this mutation may develop LV systolic dysfunction and suffer from cardiovascular events through mid-life and beyond.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Genotype-phenotype correlative studies have implicated 8 particular mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as \"benign defects,\" associated with near-normal survival: N232S, G256E, F513C, V606M, R719Q, and L908V of beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7); S179F of troponin T (TNNT2); and D175N of alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1). Routine genetic screening of HCM patients for specific mutations is anticipated to provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. The frequency and associated phenotype of these mutations in a large, unselected cohort of HCM is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 293 unrelated HCM patients were genotyped for the presence of a benign mutation. DNA was obtained after informed consent; specific MHY7, TNNT2, and TPM1 fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction; and the mutations were detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automated DNA sequencing. Only 5 (1.7%) of the 293 patients possessed a benign mutation. Moreover, all 5 subjects with an ascribed benign mutation had already manifested clinically severe expression of HCM, with all 5 requiring surgical myectomy, 3 of the 5 having a family history of sudden cardiac death, and 1 adolescent requiring an orthotopic heart transplant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the rarity of specific mutations in HCM and challenge the notion of mutation-specific clinical outcomes. Fewer than 2% of the subjects harbored a benign mutation, and those patients with a benign mutation experienced a very serious clinical course.",

        "Abstract Note": "Background Sarcomere gene mutation and myocardial fibrosis are both associated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between sarcomere gene mutation and myocardial fibrosis measured by both histopathology and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods and Results Two hundred twenty-seven patients with HCM who underwent surgical treatment, genetic testing, and CMR were enrolled. We retrospectively analyzed basic characteristics, sarcomere gene mutation, and myocardial fibrosis measured by CMR and histopathology. In our study, the mean age was 43 years, and 152 patients (67.0%) were men. A total of 107 patients (47.1%) carried a positive sarcomere gene mutation. The myocardial fibrosis ratio was significantly higher in the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)+ group (LGE+ 14.3±7.5% versus LGE- 9.0±4.3%; P=0.001). Patients with HCM with SARC+ showed a high probability of fibrosis both in histopathology (myocardial fibrosis ratio 15.3±8.0% versus 12.4±6.5%; P=0.003) and CMR examination (LGE+ 98.1% versus 84.2%; P<0.001; LGE quantification 8.3% versus 5.8%; P<0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that sarcomere gene mutation (B=2.661; P=0.005) and left atrial diameter (B=0.240; P=0.001) were related factors for histopathological myocardial fibrosis. Also, the myocardial fibrosis ratio was significantly higher in the MYH7 (myosin heavy chain) group (MYH7 18.1±9.6% versus MYBPC3 [myosin binding protein C] 13.1±5.2%; P=0.019). Conclusions Patients with HCM with positive sarcomere gene mutation had a higher myocardial fibrosis extent than patients without mutation, and a significant difference in myocardial fibrosis was also observed between the MYBPC3 and MYH7 groups. In addition, a high consistency was found between CMR-LGE and histopathological myocardial fibrosis in patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is characterized by a complex genetic component. We aimed to investigate the association between variations in genes related to cardiac ion handling and AFib in a cohort of Romanian patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Forty-five unrelated probands with HCM were genotyped by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for 24 genes associated with cardiac ion homeostasis. Subsequently, the study cohort was divided into two groups based on the presence (AFib+) or absence (AFiB-) of AFib detected during ECG monitoring. We identified two polymorphisms (rs1805127 located in KCNE1 and rs55742440 located in SCN1B) linked to AFib susceptibility. In AFib+, rs1805127 was associated with increased indexed left atrial (LA) maximal volume (LAVmax) (58.42 ± 21 mL/m2 vs. 32.54 ± 6.47 mL/m2, p < 0.001) and impaired LA strain reservoir (LASr) (13.3 ± 7.5% vs. 24.4 ± 6.8%, p < 0.05) compared to those without respective variants. The rs55742440 allele was less frequent in patients with AFib+ (12 out of 25, 48%) compared to those without arrhythmia (15 out of 20, 75%, p = 0.05). Also, AFib+ rs55742440 carriers had significantly lower LAVmax compared to those who were genotype negative. Among patients with HCM and AFib+, the rs1805127 variant was accompanied by pronounced LA remodeling, whereas rs55742440's presence was related to a milder LA enlargement.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between left ventricular (LV) contractile functional reserve and gene expression of Ca(2+)-handling proteins in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains to be clarified. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated the maximum first derivative of LV pressure (LV dP/dt(max)) and the LV pressure half-time (T(1/2)) during pacing in 14 patients with nonobstructive HCM (LV ejection fraction >55%) and 7 control subjects. Endomyocardial tissue was obtained, and mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), ryanodine receptor-2, phospholamban, calsequestrin, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger were quantified by use of a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. Group A consisted of 7 HCM patients who showed a progressive rise in the LV dP/dt(max) with increased heart rate. Group B consisted of 7 HCM patients in whom the heart rate-LV dP/dt(max) relation was biphasic at physiological pacing rates. Both the mean maximal wall thickness and the LV hypertrophy score in group B were greater than in group A (20+/-5 versus 15+/-3 mm and 7+/-1 versus 5+/-2 points, respectively). SERCA2 mRNA levels were significantly lower in group B (SERCA2/GAPDH ratio 0.34+/-0.15) compared with group A (0.72+/-0.27) and control subjects (0.85+/-0.47), whereas the mRNA expression of ryanodine receptor-2, phospholamban, calsequestrin, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that downregulation of SERCA2 mRNA, resulting in altered Ca(2+) handling, may contribute to impaired LV contractile reserve in HCM patients with severe hypertrophy, even in the absence of detectable baseline systolic dysfunction.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), two of the most common genetic cardiovascular disorders, can lead to sudden cardiac death. These conditions could be complicated by concomitant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as in the case herein described. A young amateur soccer player died in late October 2020 after a fatal arrhythmia and the autopsy revealed the presence of HCM with diffuse non-obstructive coronary disease. The molecular autopsy revealed a compound condition with a first mutation in the MYH7 gene (p.Arg719Trp) and a second mutation in the LDLR gene (p.Gly343Cys): both have already been described as associated with HCM and HeFH, respectively. In addition, molecular analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (UK variant with high titer in the myocardium. Co-segregation analysis within the family (n = 19) showed that heterozygous LDLR mutation was maternally inherited, while the heterozygous MYH7 genetic lesion was de novo. All family member carriers of the LDLR mutation (n = 13) had systematic higher LDL plasma concentrations and positive records of cardiac and vascular ischemic events at young age. Considering that HCM mutations are in themselves involved in the predisposition to malignant arrhythmogenicity and HeFH could cause higher risk of cardiac complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection, this case could represent an example of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection role in triggering or unmasking inherited cardiovascular disease, whose combination might represent the cause of fatal arrhythmia at such a young age. Additionally, it can provide clues in dating the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Northern Italy in the early phases of the second pandemic wave.",

Only a few studies have shown that mutations in MIPEP can cause combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-31 (COXPD31), an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We report herein a rare case of an 8-month-old boy in China with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), severe lactic acidosis, and hypotonia caused by novel MIPEP compound heterozygous variants. METHODS: Trio-whole-exome sequencing and copy number variation sequencing were performed to identify mutated genetic loci. Sanger sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR were used to validate the candidate single nucleotide variants and copy number variants, respectively. RESULTS: The proband was an 8-month-old boy with HCM, severe lactic acidosis, and hypotonia who died 2 months after his first admission. Two novel compound heterozygous variants, c.1081T > A (p. Tyr361Asn) and a whole deletion (Ex1-19 del), were found in the MIPEP gene, which were inherited from his healthy parents respectively. Additionally, his mitochondria DNA copy number was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: We are the first to report a patient with rare MIPEP variants in China. Our findings expand the mutation spectrum of MIPEP, and provide insights into the genotype-phenotype relationship in COXPD31.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is most often of autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. The main purpose of family screening is to identify relatives with unrecognized HCM and to monitor those at risk for disease, in order to minimize complications and to assess risk of sudden cardiac death. The ESC and ACCF/AHA guidelines on the diagnosis and management of HCM recommend the screening of child relatives from the age of 10-12 years. OBJECTIVES: We studied the outcome of clinical screening and genetic testing of child probands and relatives (<18 years of age) from families with HCM and assessed the age-related penetrance of HCM during the follow-up of these young relatives. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients from ten families were included between 2004 and 2013, consisting of three probands and 17 first-degree relatives (80% male; median age 10 years). Fourteen child relatives were mutation carriers (70%; median age eight years). Seven (50%) of the 14 mutation carriers were diagnosed with HCM at initial assessment. At-risk child relatives were defined as those with a positive mutation but a negative phenotype at enrollment. After 3.5±0.8 years of follow-up, two of the phenotype-negative mutation carriers developed HCM at 10 and 15 years of age (28% penetrance rate). CONCLUSIONS: The penetrance of HCM in phenotype-negative child relatives was 28% after 3.5 years of follow-up. This underlines the need for long-term monitoring of mutation carriers irrespective of the presence of a positive phenotype.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The prognostic implications of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) have been evaluated in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The present study analyzed LGE distribution in patients with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ES-HCM) and with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and tried to identify high risk patients in DCM. METHODS: Eleven patients with ES-HCM and 72 with DCM underwent cine- and LGE-cardiac magnetic resonance and ultrasound cardiography. The patient outcome was analyzed retrospectively for 5years of follow-up. RESULTS: LGE distributed mainly in the inter-ventricular septum, but spread more diffusely into other left ventricular segments in patients with ES-HCM and in a certain part of patients with DCM. Thus, patients with DCM can be divided into three groups according to LGE distribution; no LGE (n=24), localized LGE (localized at septum, n=36), and extensive LGE (spread into other segments, n=12). Reverse remodeling occurred after treatment in patients with no LGE and with localized LGE, but did not in patients with extensive LGE and with ES-HCM. The event-free survival rate for composite outcome (cardiac death, hospitalization for decompensated heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias) was lowest in patients with extensive LGE (92%, 74% and 42% in no LGE, localized LGE, and extensive LGE, p=0.02 vs. no LGE), and was comparable to that in patients with ES-HCM (42%). CONCLUSIONS: In DCM, patients with extensive LGE showed no functional recovery and the lowest event-free survival rate that were comparable to patients with ES-HCM. The analysis of LGE distribution may be valuable to predict reverse remodeling and to identify high-risk patients.",

A similar feature was described in athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which complicates the diagnosis for clinicians. In this context, we aimed to compare the LV function of the 2 populations by measuring global and regional strain and myocardial work using speckle-tracking imaging. METHODS: Twenty-four strength-trained asymptomatic athletes using AAS (AAS-Athletes), 22 athletes diagnosed with HCM (HCM-Athletes), and 20 healthy control athletes (Ctrl-Athletes) underwent a resting echocardiography to assess LV function. We evaluated LV global and regional strains and myocardial work, with an evaluation of the constructive work (CW), wasted work, and work efficiency (WE). RESULTS: Compared to Ctrl-Athletes, both AAS-Athletes and HCM-Athletes had a thicker interventricular septum, with majored values in HCM-Athletes. LV strain was reduced in AAS-Athletes and even more in HCM-Athletes. Consequently, global WE was significantly diminished in both AAS and HCM-Athletes (93% ± 2% in Ctrl-Athletes, 90% ± 4% in AAS-Athletes, and 90% ± 5% in HCM-Athletes (mean ± SD); p < 0.05). Constructive work and WE regional analysis showed specific alterations, with the basal septal segments preferentially affected in AAS-Athletes, and both septal and apical segments affected in HCM-Athletes. CONCLUSION: The regional evaluation of myocardial work reported specific alterations of the major LV hypertrophy induced by the regular use of AAS compared to the LV hypertrophy due to HCM. This finding could help clinicians to differentiate between these 2 forms of pathological hypertrophy.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) are both genetically determined and familial diseases that possess variable but overlapping genetic defects. Previous literature has mostly reported their occurrences as either separate disorders in different members of a family or coexisting entities in sporadic cases rather than familial cases. This study explored the echocardiographic diagnostic values and familial features in a family with coexistence of HCM and LVNC. METHODS: A four-generation family comprised of 30 members was studied; 28 members underwent familial screening by routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), contrast echocardiography (CE), and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Echocardiographic and cMRI findings were then compared. RESULTS: Four members (13.3%) died of sudden death or heart failure. Eleven members (39%) suffered from HCM, LVNC or both. There were 13 left ventricular hypertrophic segments among the echocardiographic images of 9 locally archived patients, including septal, inferior and anterior wall segments (8, 3, 2 respectively) as well as 20 noncompaction segments, including lateral, apical, anterior, antero-septal and inferior wall segments (8, 5, 4, 2, 1 respectively). Left atrial dilatation and diastolic dysfunction were significant in these subjects. Findings from TTE and CE were in accordance with those from cMRI in lesion locations. CE provided more information about noncompaction segments located in the antero-septum and near field than TTE. CONCLUSIONS: HCM and LVNC coexist in one Chinese family, with overlapping phenotypes and different ages, clinical manifestations and multimodality imaging findings. TTE is an excellent tool to diagnose HCM and LVNC with supplementation by CE.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of cardiac MRI in comparison to echocardiography in consecutive patients with previously diagnosed and new suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: All MRI studies of patients with HCM or suspected disease performed at our centre within a 10-year time period were evaluated. Initial diagnoses (echocardiography-based) and final (MRI-based) diagnoses were compared in subgroups, and the discrepancies were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1006 subjects with HCM or suspected HCM were identified (61% males, 39% females; median age, 49.1 years; interquartile range, 34.9-60.4). In 12 (2.2%) out of 550 patients with known HCM, MRI indicated a diagnosis other than HCM, including but not limited to the subaortic membrane (n = 1, 8.3%) or mild left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 5, 41.7%). Among all patients with suspected HCM (n = 456), MRI diagnosis was different from HCM in 5.3% (n = 24) of patients. In an additional 20.4% of patients (n = 93), no significant hypertrophy was present. In total, among patients with suspected HCM, MRI led to clear HCM diagnosis in 204 (44.7%) patients. Among patients with a history of uncontrolled hypertension suspected of having HCM, MRI aided in identifying cardiomyopathy in 47.9% of patients. This subgroup contained the largest proportion of patients with an ambiguous diagnosis, namely, 29.6% compared with 13.8% in the remaining groups of patients with suspected HCM (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a small but important group of patients with ultrasound-based HCM, cardiac MRI can diagnose previously unknown conditions and/or refute suspected cardiomyopathy. The diagnostic yield of MRI when compared to echocardiography in patients suspected of having HCM is 44.7%. KEY POINTS: • Out of 550 patients previously diagnosed with echocardiography but without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), we diagnosed a different disease in 12 (2.2%) patients using MRI. • Among patients with suspected HCM based on echocardiography, MRI led to clear HCM diagnosis in 44.7% of patients. • In patients with a history of uncontrolled hypertension suspected, based on an echocardiogram, of having HCM, MRI aided in identifying cardiomyopathy in 47.9% of patients. This subgroup contained the largest proportion of patients with an ambiguous diagnosis.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: European guidelines state left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic wall thickness (EDWT) ≥15mm suggests hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but distinguishing from hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is challenging. We identify cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) predictors of HHD over HCM when EDWT ≥15mm. METHODS: 2481 consecutive clinical CMRs between 2014 and 2015 were reviewed. 464 segments from 29 HCM subjects with EDWT ≥15mm but without other cardiac abnormality, hypertension or renal impairment were analyzed. 432 segments from 27 HHD subjects with EDWT ≥15mm but without concomitant cardiac pathology were analyzed. Magnitude and location of maximal EDWT, presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), LV asymmetry (>1.5-fold opposing segment) and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) were measured. Multivariate logistic regression was performed. Significance was defined as p<0.05. RESULTS: HHD and HCM cohorts were age-/gender-matched. HHD had significantly increased indexed LV mass (110±27g/m2 vs. 91±31g/m2, p=0.016) but no difference in site or magnitude of maximal EDWT. Mid-wall LGE was significantly more prevalent in HCM. Elevated indexed LVM, mid-wall LGE and absence of SAM were significant multivariate predictors of HHD, but LV asymmetry was not. CONCLUSIONS: Increased indexed LV mass, absence of mid-wall LGE and absence of SAM are better CMR discriminators of HHD from HCM than EDWT ≥15mm. KEY POINTS: • Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often diagnosed with end-diastolic wall thickness ≥15mm. • Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) can be difficult to distinguish from HCM. • Retrospective case-control study showed that location and magnitude of EDWT are poor discriminators. • Increased left ventricular mass and midwall fibrosis are independent predictors of HHD. • Cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters facilitate a better discrimination between HHD and HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy remains challenging in clinical practice, in particular, between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and increased LV wall thickness because of systemic hypertension. Diffuse myocardial disease is a characteristic feature in HCM, and an early manifestation of sarcomere-gene mutations in subexpressed family members (G+P- subjects). This study aimed to investigate whether detecting diffuse myocardial disease by T1 mapping can discriminate between HCM versus hypertensive heart disease as well as to detect genetically driven interstitial changes in the G+P- subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with diagnoses of HCM or hypertension (HCM, n=95; hypertension, n=69) and G+P- subjects (n=23) underwent a clinical cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol (3 tesla) for cardiac volumes, function, and scar imaging. T1 mapping was performed before and >20 minutes after administration of 0.2 mmol/kg of gadobutrol. Native T1 and extracellular volume fraction were significantly higher in HCM compared with patients with hypertension (P<0.0001), including in subgroup comparisons of HCM subjects without evidence of late gadolinium enhancement, as well as of hypertensive patients LV wall thickness of >15 mm (P<0.0001). Compared with controls, native T1 was significantly higher in G+P- subjects (P<0.0001) and 65% of G+P- subjects had a native T1 value >2 SD above the mean of the normal range. Native T1 was an independent discriminator between HCM and hypertension, over and above extracellular volume fraction, LV wall thickness and indexed LV mass. Native T1 was also useful in separating G+P- subjects from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Native T1 may be applied to discriminate between HCM and hypertensive heart disease and detect early changes in G+P- subjects.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: We investigated the presence of a clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD), and cardiac events during follow-up in predictively tested-not known to have a clinical diagnosis of HCM before the DNA test-carriers of a sarcomeric gene mutation and associations with age and gender to determine the best cardiological screening strategy. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six (30%) of 446 mutation carriers were diagnosed with HCM at one or more cardiological evaluation(s). Male gender and higher age were associated with manifest disease. Incidence of newly diagnosed manifest HCM was <10% per person-year under the age of 40 years and >10% in older carriers, although numbers were small in carriers <15 years. Twenty-three percent of carriers, with and without manifest disease, had established risk factor(s) for SCD (no significant difference). During an average follow-up of 3.5 ± 1.7 years two carriers, both with manifest disease, died suddenly (0.13% per person-year). A high-risk status for SCD (≥2 risk factors and manifest HCM) was present in 17 carriers during follow-up (2.4% per person-year). Age but not gender was associated with a high-risk status for SCD. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent of carriers had or developed manifest HCM after predictive DNA testing and risk factors for SCD were frequently present. Our data suggest that the SCD risk is low and risk stratification for SCD can be omitted in carriers without manifest disease and that frequency of cardiological evaluations can possibly be decreased in carriers between 15 and 40 years as long as hypertrophy is absent.",

However, little has been reported on the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and long-term prognosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) detected by the SS. METHODS: All 44 consecutive pediatric HCM patients (10.1 ± 3.0 years old), who had been originally consulted by the SS before the diagnosis of HCM from April 1981 to April 2017, were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: At the SS, all patients showed mild or no symptoms. All patients showed ECG abnormalities, and 75 % had a high proposed ECG risk score (≧6). However, 30 % of them had no echocardiogram finding of myocardial hypertrophy. During the follow-up period (14.8 ± 10.0 years), life-threatening events (LTE) occurred in 11 (25 %) patients, and the first LTE occurred during exercise in 8 (18 %). The estimated LTE and heart failure death-free survival rate at 10 years was 64.9 %. The LTE-free survival rate was lower in patients without than in those with myocardial hypertrophy at the SS. CONCLUSIONS: The SS was useful in detecting patients with HCM with mild or no symptoms at the early stage. However, our study indicated that early detection of HCM is not associated with improvement in the prognosis of the patients. Further studies are needed.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: The maintenance of sinus rhythm is crucial for the functional capacity of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Using a multimodality approach, we attempted to identify potential predictors of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in HCM patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty HCM patients (17 males, mean age 57.9 ± 13.6) with at least one documented PAF episode and 32 age- and sex-matched HCM control patients as well as 25 healthy volunteers were studied in sinus rhythm. Study subjects underwent 2D echocardiography including a colour Doppler myocardial imaging evaluation of the left atrium (LA). Additionally, an orthogonal electrocardiogram was acquired; P-wave duration, maximum, and mean energies were calculated for each subject at each orthogonal lead and the composite vector axis using the Morlet wavelet analysis. Compared with HCM controls, in HCM-PAF patients, LA antero-posterior diameter was significantly enlarged (LADAP: 46.1 ± 5.9 vs. 40.0 ± 4.7 mm, P < 0.001), peak strain rate of the LA lateral wall in the reservoir phase was significantly decreased (LAT peak SR-S: 1.93 ± 0.51 vs. 2.55 ± 0.83 s(-1), P < 0.01), and P-wave duration in the Z-lead was significantly prolonged (P-durZ: 106.9 ± 24.6 vs. 86.2 ± 14.3 ms, P < 0.001). Cut-off values and areas under the curve (AUCs) for individual parameters were 42.0 mm, 2.32 s(-1), and 98.8 ms and 0.81, 0.74, and 0.78, respectively. A multivariable model combining LADAP, LAT peak SR-S and P-durZ had an AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 0.87, and a specificity of 0.91 for identifying PAF patients. CONCLUSION: P-wave duration combined with LA antero-posterior diameter and myocardial deformation indices resulted in a higher power for discriminating HCM-PAF patients, when compared with individual parameters derived from either wavelet analysis or 2D echocardiography.",

RESULTS: From 2000 to 2023, 273 individuals underwent cardiologic evaluation following P/LP variant detection through family screening. Upon initial evaluation, HCM was diagnosed in 128 (47 %) individuals. Comparing with 145 G+/P- individuals, HCM patients were older (48 vs 38 years, p < 0.001) and more likely male (57 % vs 34 %, p < 0.001). During follow-up (median 11 years), 14 (11 %) of the HCM patients died (two from sudden cardiac death), four (3 %) underwent myectomy, 15 (12 %) developed atrial fibrillation and 17 (13 %) required implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation (15 primary prevention, 88 %). HCM-related adverse outcomes correlated with younger diagnosis age. During follow-up (median 8 years) of 118 (out of 145) G+/P- subjects with at least one year of follow-up, seven (6 %) individuals (71 % female, diagnosed age 39-77, after median follow-up 6 years) developed HCM (mean maximal wall thickness increasing from 10.2 mm to 13.3 mm). In this G+/P- cohort, significant echocardiographic changes from baseline to last visit were negligible. Over half (56 %) had <1 mm change of maximal wall thickness. No adverse cardiac outcomes occurred. CONCLUSION: The initial evaluation was high-yield, with HCM being diagnosed in 47 % of G+ individuals, more frequently in older males. Over a median 8-year follow-up, 6 % of G+/P- individuals developed mild HCM, with no adverse cardiac outcomes. These data support initial screening in all first degree relatives, but (very) low-frequency cardiologic evaluations for G+/P- individuals thereafter.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: We have developed a novel and practical cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) technique to evaluate left ventricular (LV) mitral annular motion by tracking the atrioventricular junction (AVJ). To test AVJ motion analysis as a metric for LV function, we compared AVJ motion variables between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a group with recognized systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and healthy volunteers. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 24 HCM patients with normal ejection fractions (EF) and 14 healthy volunteers. Using the 4-chamber view cine images, we tracked the longitudinal motion of the lateral and septal AVJ at 25 time points during the cardiac cycle. Based on AVJ displacement versus time, we calculated maximum AVJ displacement (MD) and velocity in early diastole (MVED), velocity in diastasis (VDS) and the composite index VDS/MVED. RESULTS: Patients with HCM showed significantly slower median lateral and septal AVJ recoil velocities during early diastole, but faster velocities in diastasis. We observed a 16-fold difference in VDS/MVED at the lateral AVJ [median 0.141, interquartile range (IQR) 0.073, 0.166 versus 0.009 IQR -0.006, 0.037, P < 0.001]. Patients with HCM also demonstrated significantly less mitral annular excursion at both the septal and lateral AVJ. Performed offline, AVJ motion analysis took approximately 10 minutes per subject. CONCLUSIONS: Atrioventricular junction motion analysis provides a practical and novel CMR method to assess mitral annular motion. In this proof of concept study we found highly statistically significant differences in mitral annular excursion and recoil between HCM patients and healthy volunteers.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate ethnic differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling between highly-trained athletes of African/Afro-Caribbean (black) and Caucasian (white) athletes. BACKGROUND: The upper limits of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are established in white athletes and aid the differentiation of physiologic LVH from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are few data regarding LV remodeling in black athletes, in whom deaths from HCM are more prevalent. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2007, 300 nationally ranked black male athletes (mean age 20.5 years) underwent 12-lead electrocardiogram and 2-dimensional echocardiography. The results were compared with 150 black and white sedentary individuals and 300 highly-trained white male athletes matched for age, size, and sport. RESULTS: Black athletes exhibited greater LV wall thickness and cavity size compared with sedentary black and white individuals. Black athletes had greater LV wall thickness compared with white athletes (11.3 +/- 1.6 mm vs. 10 +/- 1.5 mm; p < 0.001). In absolute terms, 54 black athletes (18%) had LV wall thickness >12 mm compared with 12 white athletes (4%), and 3% of black athletes exhibited LV wall thickness >/=15 mm compared with none of the white athletes. Black athletes with LVH displayed an enlarged LV cavity and normal diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS: Black athletes develop a greater magnitude of LVH compared with white athletes; therefore, extrapolation of conclusions derived from white athletes has the potential of generating false-positive diagnoses of HCM in black athletes.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Microvascular ischemia is one of the hallmarks of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and has been associated with poor outcome. However, myocardial fibrosis, seen on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), can be responsible for rest perfusion defects in up to 30% of patients with HCM, potentially leading to an overestimation of the ischemic burden. We investigated the effect of left ventricle (LV) scar on the total LV ischemic burden using novel high-resolution perfusion analysis techniques in conjunction with LGE quantification. METHODS: 30 patients with HCM and unobstructed epicardial coronary arteries underwent CMR with Fermi constrained quantitative perfusion analysis on segmental and high-resolution data. The latter were corrected for the presence of fibrosis on a pixel-by-pixel basis. RESULTS: High-resolution quantification proved more sensitive for the detection of microvascular ischemia in comparison to segmental analysis. Areas of LGE were associated with significant reduction of myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) leading to an overestimation of the total ischemic burden on non-corrected perfusion maps. Using a threshold MPR of 1.5, the presence of LGE caused an overestimation of the ischemic burden of 28%. The ischemic burden was more severe in patients with fibrosis, also after correction of the perfusion maps, in keeping with more severe disease in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: LGE is an important confounder in the assessment of the ischemic burden in patients with HCM. High-resolution quantitative analysis with LGE correction enables the independent evaluation of microvascular ischemia and fibrosis and should be used when evaluating patients with HCM.",

Contemporary management of oHCM has decreased annual hospitalization and mortality rates, yet patients have worsening health-related quality of life due to impaired exercise capacity and persistent residual symptoms. Here we consider the design of clinical trials evaluating potential oHCM therapies in the context of SEQUOIA-HCM (Safety, Efficacy, and Quantitative Understanding of Obstruction Impact of Aficamten in HCM). This large, phase 3 trial is now fully enrolled (N = 282). Baseline characteristics reflect an ethnically diverse population with characteristics typical of patients encountered clinically with substantial functional and symptom burden. The study will assess the effect of aficamten vs placebo, in addition to standard-of-care medications, on functional capacity and symptoms over 24 weeks. Future clinical trials could model the approach in SEQUOIA-HCM to evaluate the effect of potential therapies on the burden of oHCM.

        "Abstract Note": "Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is associated with a deterioration of clinical status. Ablation of symptomatic AF is an established therapy, but in HCM, the characteristics of recurrent atrial arrhythmias and the long-term outcome are uncertain. Methods and Results Sixty-five patients with HCM (aged 64.5±9.9 years, 42 [64.6%] men) underwent AF ablation. The ablation strategy included pulmonary vein isolation in all patients and ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms or subsequent atrial tachycardias (AT) if appropriate. Paroxysmal, persistent AF, and a primary AT was present in 13 (20.0%), 51 (78.5%), and 1 (1.5%) patients, respectively. Twenty-five (38.4%) patients developed AT with a total number of 54 ATs. Stable AT was observed in 15 (23.1%) and unstable AT in 10 (15.3%) patients. The mechanism was characterized as a macroreentry in 37 (68.5%), as a localized reentry in 12 (22.2%), a focal mechanism in 1 (1.9%), and not classified in 4 (7.4%) ATs. After 1.9±1.2 ablation procedures and a follow-up of 48.1±32.5 months, freedom of AF/AT recurrences was demonstrated in 60.0% of patients. No recurrences occurred in 84.6% and 52.9% of patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively (P<0.01). Antiarrhythmic drug therapy was maintained in 24 (36.9%) patients. Conclusions AF ablation in patients with HCM is effective for long-term rhythm control, and especially patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing pulmonary vein isolation have a good clinical outcome. ATs after AF ablation are frequently observed in HCM. Freedom of atrial arrhythmia is achieved by persistent AF ablation in a reasonable number of patients even though the use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy remains high.",

        "Abstract Note": "Data on utilization and safety of mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients is limited. Our study aimed to assess the national utilization, safety, and clinical outcomes of TEER procedures among HCM patients using a nationwide real-world cohort. HCM patients undergoing TEER hospitalizations between 2015-2020 were identified using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, (ICD-10-CM/PCS). HCM-TEER and HCM No-TEER formed the two comparison groups. Demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities, procedural complications, inpatient mortality, length of stay (LOS), and cost of hospitalization were compared between the propensity-matched cohorts. Numeric values of 10 or less were not reported per NIS data use agreements. A total of 39,625 weighted cases of TEER were identified from 2015-2020. Of the included patients, 335 patients had the HCM diagnosis. The median age of the HCM-TEER group was 74 (70-79) vs. 79 (72-85) for the no-TEER cohort. The TEER procedure was more frequently performed among Caucasians (86.57%) and females (53.73%). The TEER procedure among HCM patients had similar in-hospital mortality (Adjusted odds ratio: aOR 1.50, 95% CI [0.68-3.29]; p = 0.30) and net adverse cardiac events (NACE) (aOR 1.16, 95% CI [0.73-1.85]; p = 0.51). TEER among HCM was associated with higher odds of gastrointestinal/hematological (aOR 2.33, 95% CI [1.29-4.19]; p = 0.003) complications. However, the odds of cardiac complications (aOR 0.57, 95% CI [0.33-0.96]; p = 0.03) were not higher. The median length of stay was similar in both the groups (median: 2 vs. 2, p = 0.74), although TEER among HCM was associated with higher costs of hospitalization ($44729.36 vs. $40513.82, p < 0.01). TEER is a minimally invasive procedure and could be a safe option for symptomatic HCM patients with significant MR who are poor surgical candidates. Mitral TEER among HCM has been increasingly utilized in recent years in the United States more commonly in obstructive HCM and is associated with no difference in mortality and net adverse cardiac events but higher odds for gastrointestinal/hematological complications than non-HCM patients.",

Trametinib, a MEK-inhibitor approved for treatment of RAS/MAPK-mutated cancers, is an emerging treatment option for HCM in NS. We report a patient with NS and HCM, treated with Trametinib and documented by global RNA sequencing before and during treatment to define transcriptional effects of MEK-inhibition. A preterm infant with HCM carrying the RAF1:p.Ser257Leu variant, rapidly developed severe congestive heart failure (CHF) unresponsive to standard treatments. Trametinib was introduced (0.022 mg/kg/day) with prompt clinical improvement and subsequent amelioration of HCM at ultrasound. The appearance of pulmonary artery aneurysm and pulmonary hypertension contributed to a rapid worsening after ventriculoperitoneal shunt device placement for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus: she deceased for untreatable CHF at 3 months of age. Autopsy showed severe obstructive HCM, pulmonary artery dilation, disarrayed pulmonary vascular anatomy consistent with pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Transcriptome across treatment, highlighted robust transcriptional changes induced by MEK-inhibition. Our findings highlight a previously unappreciated connection between pulmonary vascular disease and the severe outcome already reported in patients with RAF1-associated NS. While MEK-inhibition appears a promising therapeutic option for HCM in RASopathies, it appears insufficient to revert pulmonary hypertension.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the mechanisms linking dynamic obstruction and exercise tolerance in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). BACKGROUND: Patients with HOCM have reduced exercise tolerance. However, the association between dynamic obstruction and peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) is weak. METHODS: We enrolled 25 patients with HOCM, 20 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and 20 normal control patients. Two-dimensional, Doppler, strain, and left ventricular (LV) twist mechanics by speckle tracking echocardiography were obtained. The 25 HOCM patients had left heart catheterization, and 16 were re-examined after septal reduction. RESULTS: Deformation measurements were the lowest in HOCM patients and increased (p<0.05) after septal reduction. Twist and untwisting rate were not different between patients with HCM and control patients, but untwisting was significantly delayed in HCM patients and longest in HOCM patients. The delay related well with LV end-diastolic pressure (r=0.76) and volume (r=-0.73), and VO2max (r=-0.75, all p<0.01). After septal reduction, untwisting occurred earlier and accounted for the increase in end-diastolic volume (r=0.65), and VO2max (r=0.74, both p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic obstruction leads to delayed untwisting in HOCM, which accounts well for the increased LV filling pressures, the reduced LV volumes, and VO2max. After septal reduction, untwisting occurs earlier and leads to an improvement in LV filling and exercise tolerance.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Treatment options for patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are limited. We sought to determine whether biventricular (BiV) pacing improves exercise capacity in HCM patients, and whether this is via augmented diastolic filling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with symptomatic non-obstructive HCM were enrolled. Following device implantation, patients underwent detailed assessment of exercise diastolic filling using radionuclide ventriculography in BiV and sham pacing modes. Patients then entered an 8-month crossover study of BiV and sham pacing in random order, to assess the effect on exercise capacity [peak oxygen consumption (VO2 )]. Patients were grouped on pre-specified analysis according to whether left ventricular end-diastolic volume increased (+LVEDV) or was unchanged/decreased (-LVEDV) with exercise at baseline. Twenty-nine patients (20 male, mean age 55 years) completed the study. There were 14 +LVEDV patients and 15 -LVEDV patients. Baseline peak VO2 was lower in -LVEDV patients vs. +LVEDV patients (16.2 ± 0.9 vs. 19.9 ± 1.1 mL/kg/min, P = 0.04). BiV pacing significantly increased exercise ΔLVEDV (P = 0.004) and Δstroke volume (P = 0.008) in -LVEDV patients, but not in +LVEDV patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction and end-systolic elastance did not increase with BiV pacing in either group. This translated into significantly greater improvements in exercise capacity (peak VO2  + 1.4 mL/kg/min, P = 0.03) and quality of life scores (P = 0.02) in -LVEDV patients during the crossover study. There was no effect on left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony in either group. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic patients with non-obstructive HCM may benefit from BiV pacing via augmentation of diastolic filling on exercise rather than contractile improvement. This may be due to relief of diastolic ventricular interaction. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00504647.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that exercise training (ET) confers significant symptomatic and functional improvements in patients with diastolic dysfunction, and thus may be beneficial in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are no data regarding the safety or efficacy of ET in HCM patients. DESIGN: A prospective non-randomized intervention design was used. METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients with symptomatic HCM, significantly limited in everyday activity, into a supervised cardiac rehabilitation exercise program. RESULTS: Patients were 62 ± 13 years old, in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II (35%) or III (65%), had a mean interventricular septum dimension of 17 ± 5 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 53 ± 15%. Left ventricular outflow gradient was present at rest in nine patients (mean 51 ± 24 mm Hg) and six patients had an implantable defibrillator. Exercise prescription was based on heart rate reserve (HRR) determined from a symptom-limited graded exercise stress test. Exercise intensity was gradually increased from 50% to 85% of the HRR over the training period. Patients completed an average of 41 ± 8 hours of aerobic ET. No adverse events or sustained ventricular arrhythmias occurred during the training program. Functional capacity, assessed by a graded exercise test, improved from 4.7 ± 2.2 to 7.2 ± 2.8 metabolic equivalents (METs) (p = 0.01). NYHA functional class improved from baseline by ≥ 1 grade in 10 patients (50%) and none experiencing deterioration during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that patients with HCM who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy may achieve considerable functional improvement through a supervised ET program.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) and modified Morrow septal myectomy (MMSM) are two invasive strategies used to relieve obstruction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This study aimed to determine the clinical outcome of these two strategies. METHODS: From January 2011 to January 2015, 226 patients with HCM were treated, 68 by PTSMA and 158 by MMSM. Both ultrasonic cardiograms and heart functional class were recorded before, after operations and in the follow-up. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Quantitative variables were compared using the paired samples t-test. RESULTS: Interventricular septal thickness was significantly reduced in both groups (21.27 ± 4.43 mm vs. 18.72 ± 4.13 mm for PTSMA, t = 3.469, P < 0.001, and 21.83 ± 5.03 mm vs. 16.57 ± 3.95 mm for MMSM, t = 10.349, P < 0.001, respectively). The left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) pressure gradient (PG) significantly decreased after the operations in two groups (70.30 ± 44.79 mmHg vs. 39.78 ± 22.07 mmHg for PTSMA, t = 5.041, P < 0.001, and 74.58 ± 45.52 mmHg vs. 13.95 ± 9.94 mmHg for MMSM, t = 16.357, P < 0.001, respectively). Seven patients (10.29%) in the PTSMA group required a repeat operation in the follow-up. Eight (11.76%) patients were evaluated for New York Heart Association (NYHA) III/IV in the PTSMA group, which was significantly more than the five (3.16%) in the same NYHA classes for the MMSM group at follow-up. Less than 15% of patients in the PTSMA group and none of the patients in the MMSM group complained of chest pain during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Both strategies can not only relieve LVOT PG but also improve heart function in patients with HCM. However, MMSM might provide a more reliable reduction in gradients compared to PTSMA.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe the acute morphologic differences that result from septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. BACKGROUND: Surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in severely symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: Cine and contrast-enhanced CMR images were obtained in HCM patients before and after septal myectomy (n = 24) and alcohol septal ablation (n = 24). Location of septal reduction, extent of myocardial necrosis, and conduction system abnormalities with each technique were compared. RESULTS: With septal myectomy, there was a discrete area of resected tissue consistently localized to anterior septum. In contrast, alcohol septal ablation resulted in a more variable effect. In most patients, alcohol septal ablation caused a transmural region of tissue necrosis, located more inferiorly in the basal septum than myectomy and usually extending into the right ventricular side of the septum at the midventricular level. However, there were 6 patients after alcohol septal ablation in whom there was sparing of the basal septum with residual gradients at follow-up. After the procedure, left bundle branch block developed in 46% of septal myectomy patients, and right bundle branch block was evident in 58% of alcohol septal ablation patients. CONCLUSIONS: Septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation for severely symptomatic, drug-refractory patients with obstructive HCM have different morphologic effects and location sites on left ventricular septal myocardium. Septal myectomy provides consistent resection of the obstructing portion of the anterior basal septum, whereas the effect of ethanol septal ablation is more variable. These findings may have important implications for patient selection and management as well as long-term outcome.",

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative to warfarin, but there are limited data to support their use in patients with HCM and AF. We sought to compare thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality between NOAC and warfarin in patients with HCM and AF. METHODS: From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database during the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016, we identified a warfarin-treated group of patients with HCM and AF (n = 955) who were compared with a 1:2 propensity-matched NOAC treated group (n = 1,504). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 16 months, the incidence rates of ischemic stroke and major bleeding were similar between NOAC- and warfarin-treated patients with HCM and AF. NOAC-treated patients had lower incidence rates for all-cause mortality (5.11 and 10.13 events per 100 person-years for NOAC and warfarin groups) and the composite of fatal cardiovascular events (0.77 and 1.80 events per 100 person-years). Compared with warfarin, use of NOACs was associated with a significantly lower risk of all cause-mortality (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.32-0.57) and composite fatal cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with warfarin, patients with HCM and AF on NOACs had similar stroke and major bleeding risks, but lower all-cause mortality and composite fatal cardiovascular events. Our data suggest that patients with HCM and AF can be safely and effectively treated with NOACs.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The presence and extent of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a major determinant of symptoms in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). There is increasing evidence to suggest that myocardial energetic impairment represents a central mechanism leading to LVH in HCM. There is currently a significant unmet need for disease-modifying therapy that regresses LVH in HCM patients. Perhexiline, a potent carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) inhibitor, improves myocardial energetics in HCM, and has the potential to reduce LVH in HCM. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of perhexiline treatment on the extent of LVH, in symptomatic HCM patients with at least moderate LVH. METHODS/DESIGN: RESOLVE-HCM is a prospective, multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial enrolling symptomatic HCM patients with at least moderate LVH. Sixty patients will be randomized to receive either perhexiline or matching placebo. The primary endpoint is change in LVH, assessed utilizing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, after 12-months treatment with perhexiline. SUMMARY: RESOLVE-HCM will provide novel information on the utility of perhexiline in regression of LVH in symptomatic HCM patients. A positive result would lead to the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial addressing long-term effects of perhexiline on risk of heart failure and mortality in HCM patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Improving symptoms is a primary treatment goal in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Currently available pharmacological options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are not disease-specific and are often inadequate or poorly tolerated. We aimed to assess the effect of mavacamten, a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, on patients' health status-ie, symptoms, physical and social function, and quality of life. METHODS: We did a health status analysis of EXPLORER-HCM, a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The study took place at 68 clinical cardiovascular centres in 13 countries. Adult patients (≥18 years) with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (gradient ≥50 mm Hg and New York Heart Association class II-III) were randomly assigned (1:1) to mavacamten or placebo for 30 weeks, followed by an 8-week washout period. Both patients and staff were masked to study treatment. The primary outcome for this secondary analysis was the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a well validated disease-specific measure of patients' health status. It was administered at baseline and weeks 6, 12, 18, 30 (end of treatment), and 38 (end of study). Changes from baseline to week 30 in KCCQ overall summary (OS) score and all subscales were analysed using mixed model repeated measures. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03470545. FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2018, and July 12, 2019, 429 adults were assessed for eligibility, of whom 251 (59%) were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 123 patients randomly assigned to mavacamten, 92 (75%) completed the KCCQ at baseline and week 30 and of the 128 patients randomly assigned to placebo 88 (69%) completed the KCCQ at baseline and week 30. At 30 weeks, the change in KCCQ-OS score was greater with mavacamten than placebo (mean score 14·9 [SD 15·8] vs 5·4 [13·7]; difference +9·1 [95% CI 5·5-12·8]; p<0·0001), with similar benefits across all KCCQ subscales. The proportion of patients with a very large change (KCCQ-OS ≥20 points) was 36% (33 of 92) in the mavacamten group versus 15% (13 of 88) in the placebo group, with an estimated absolute difference of 21% (95% CI 8·8-33·4) and number needed to treat of five (95% CI 3-11). These gains returned to baseline after treatment was stopped. INTERPRETATION: Mavacamten markedly improved the health status of patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared with placebo, with a low number needed to treat for marked improvement. Given that the primary goals of treatment are to improve symptoms, physical and social function, and quality of life, mavacamten represents a new potential strategy for achieving these goals.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: The study analyzed factors, including treatment, affecting disease-related death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presenting in childhood. BACKGROUND: Previous smaller studies suggest that mortality is higher in patients with HCM presenting in childhood compared with presentation in adulthood, but these studies have all originated from selected patient populations in tertiary referral centers, and reported no significant protection by treatment. METHODS: Retrospective comparisons of mortality were done in total cohort of patients presenting to three regional centers of pediatric cardiology. There were 66 patients (25 with Noonan's syndrome) with HCM presenting at age <19 years; mean follow-up was 12.0 years. RESULTS: Among risk factors for death were congestive heart failure (p = 0.008), large electrocardiogram voltages (Sokolow-Lyon index p = 0.0003), and degree of septal (p = 0.004) and left ventricular (p = 0.028) hypertrophy expressed as percent of 95th centile value. The only treatment that significantly reduced the risk of death on multifactorial analysis of variance was high-dose beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy (propranolol 5 to 23 mg/kg/day or equivalent; p = 0.0001). Nineteen out of 40 patients managed conventionally (no treatment, 0.8 to 4 mg/kg of propranolol, or verapamil) died, median survival 15.8 years, with no deaths among 26 patients on high-dose beta-blockers (p = 0.0004); survival proportions at 10 years were 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.80) and 1.0, respectively (p = 0.0015). Survival time analysis shows better survival in the high-dose beta-blocker group compared with the \"no specific therapy\" group (p = 0.0009) and with the conventional-dose beta-blocker group (p = 0.002). Hazard ratio analysis suggests that high-dose beta-blocker therapy produces a 5-10-fold reduction in the risk of disease-related death. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose beta-blocker therapy improves survival in childhood HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HTN) is common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but its effect on the treatment of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is undefined. Although elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) may impact dynamic LVOT gradients, its response to cardiac myosin inhibition is unknown. OBJECTIVES: In a post hoc exploratory analysis of the EXPLORER-HCM trial (Clinical Study to Evaluate Mavacamten [MYK-461] in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy), the authors examined the characteristics of patients with obstructive HCM and HTN and the associations between HTN, SBP, and the response to mavacamten treatment of LVOT obstruction. METHODS: Patients were stratified by baseline history of HTN and mean SBP during 30-week treatment with mavacamten or placebo. The study estimated treatment differences and evaluated HTN and SBP groups by treatment interaction. Analysis of covariance was used to model changes in continuous endpoints, and a generalized linear model was used for binary endpoints. RESULTS: HTN was present in 119 of 251 patients (47.4%), including 60 receiving mavacamten and 59 receiving placebo. Patients with HTN vs no HTN were older (63.4 vs 54.0 years; P < 0.001), had higher SBP (134 ± 15.1 mm Hg vs 123 ± 13.8 mm Hg; P < 0.001), more comorbidities, and lower peak oxygen consumption (19 ± 3 vs 20 ± 4 mL/kg/min; P = 0.021). Patients with HTN had similar NYHA functional class (NYHA functional class II, 72% vs 73%), Valsalva LVOT gradients (72 ± 34 mm Hg vs 74 ± 30 mm Hg), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Scores (70.6 ± 18.8 vs 68.9 ± 23.1), and NT pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (geometric mean 632 ± 129 pg/mL vs 745 ± 130 pg/mL). Mavacamten-treated patients had improvement in all primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints regardless of HTN status or mean SBP. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefits of mavacamten in symptomatic, obstructive HCM were similar in patients with and without HTN, despite differences in baseline characteristics.

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: To determine the impact of surgical myectomy on ventricular arrhythmias in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) correlates with adverse outcomes, including sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with HCM. Surgical myectomy is the primary treatment strategy for relief of symptoms owing to LVOTO and has been hypothesized to decrease the potential for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the Mayo Clinic HCM database for those patients with HCM who had received implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and grouped the patients into myectomy and non-myectomy groups. Retrospective analysis of the incidence of SCD and appropriate ICD discharge was performed in addition to the analysis of ICD interrogation records. A total of 125 patients defined by these parameters were followed at the Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2005. New York Heart Association functional class, anti-arrhythmic drug usage, wall thickness, and reasons for ICD implantation were similar between the groups; 118 patients underwent ICD implantation for primary prevention and seven for secondary prevention after sustained ventricular arrhythmias. There were no SCDs during this follow-up period in either group, whereas 12 (17%) patients in the non-myectomy group and only one (2%) patient in the myectomy group sustained appropriate ICD discharges. The average annualized event rate was 4.3% per year in the non-myectomy group, compared with 0.24% per year following myectomy (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that surgical myectomy, primarily performed to relieve outflow tract obstruction and severe symptoms in HCM, is associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of appropriate ICD discharge and risk for SCD.",

Predefined criteria were utilized for selecting data on study characteristics and results. RESULTS: The study included a total of 387 patients from 6 randomized controlled trials, which were reported in 7 articles. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the utilization of ARBs did not yield a reduction in left ventricular (LV) mass (p = 0.07) and maximum LV wall thickness (p = 0.25), nor did it demonstrate any improvement in LV fibrosis (p = 0.39). Furthermore, there was no significant impact observed on early diastolic mitral annular velocity (p = 0.19) and LV ejection fraction (p = 0.44).

This study describes the implant and programming strategies with clinical outcomes following implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) insertion in a well-characterized national paediatric HCM cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 90 patients undergoing ICD insertion at a median age 13 (±3.5) for primary (n = 67, 74%) or secondary prevention (n = 23, 26%) were collected from a retrospective, longitudinal multi-centre cohort of children (<16 years) with HCM from the UK. Seventy-six (84%) had an endovascular system [14 (18%) dual coil], 3 (3%) epicardial, and 11 (12%) subcutaneous system. Defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing was performed at implant in 68 (76%). Inadequate DFT in four led to implant adjustment in three patients. Over a median follow-up of 54 months (interquartile range 28-111), 25 (28%) patients had 53 appropriate therapies [ICD shock n = 45, anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) n = 8], incidence rate 4.7 per 100 patient years (95% CI 2.9-7.6). Eight inappropriate therapies occurred in 7 (8%) patients (ICD shock n = 4, ATP n = 4), incidence rate 1.1/100 patient years (95% CI 0.4-2.5). Three patients (3%) died following arrhythmic events, despite a functioning device. Other device complications were seen in 28 patients (31%), including lead-related complications (n = 15) and infection (n = 10). No clinical, device, or programming characteristics predicted time to inappropriate therapy or lead complication. CONCLUSION: In a large national cohort of paediatric HCM patients with an ICD, device and programming strategies varied widely. No particular strategy was associated with inappropriate therapies, missed/delayed therapies, or lead complications.",

The aim of our study was to ascertain the percentage of events in our series of primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator recipients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and whether HCM Risk-SCD predicts the onset of arrhythmic events. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort study, which included 48 primary prevention defibrillator recipient patients with HCM. We compiled their demographic and clinical characteristics, estimated 5-year risk using HCM Risk-SCD, and collected the documentation on arrhythmias during follow-up. The majority was male (66.7%) and mean age at implantation was 44.44 ± 14.46 years. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the most prevalent risk factor (66.67%), followed by a family history of sudden death (47.92%). Mean HCM Risk-SCD was 6.15 ± 5.01%. HCM Risk-SCD was the only factor independently associated with the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, above any other classic risk factor or association [odds ratio = 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.051-2.013); P = 0.02]. None of the 11 patients estimated as low risk using HCM Risk-SCD suffered any appropriate events (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During an average follow-up of 4 years, 16.67% presented appropriate events (4.16%/year). HCM Risk-SCD predicted the onset of events more suitably than classic risk factors.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex cardiac condition characterized by hypercontractility of cardiac muscle leading to a dynamic obstruction of left ventricular outlet tract (LVOT). Mavacamten, a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, is increasingly being studied in randomized controlled trials. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety profile of Mavacamten compared to placebo in patients of HCM. METHOD: We carried out a comprehensive search in PubMed, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov to analyze the efficacy and safety of mavacamten compared to placebo from 2010 to 2023. To calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) at 95% confidence interval (CI), the Mantel-Haenszel formula with random effect was used and Generic Inverse Variance method assessed pooled mean difference value at a 95% CI. RevMan was used for analysis. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: We analyzed five phase 3 RCTs including 609 patients to compare mavacamten with a placebo. New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade improvement and KCCQ score showed the odds ratio as 4.94 and 7.93 with p<0.00001 at random effect, respectively. Cardiac imaging which included LAVI, LVOT at rest, LVOT post valsalva, LVOT post-exercise, and reduction in LVEF showed the pooled mean differences for change as -5.29, -49.72, -57.45, -36.11, and -3.00 respectively. Changes in LVEDV and LVMI were not statistically significant. The pooled mean difference for change in NT-proBNP and Cardiac troponin-I showed 0.20 and 0.57 with p<0.00001. The efficacy was evaluated in 1) A composite score, which was defined as either 1·5 mL/kg per min or greater increase in peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) and at least one NYHA class reduction, or a 3·0 mL/kg per min or greater pVO2 increase without NYHA class worsening and 2) changes in pVO2, which was not statistically significant. Similarly, any treatment-associated emergent adverse effects (TEAE), treatment-associated serious adverse effects (TSAE), and cardiac-related adverse effects were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Mavacamten influences diverse facets of HCM comprehensively. Notably, our study delved into the drug's impact on the heart's structural and functional aspects, providing insights that complement prior findings. Further large-scale trials are needed to evaluate the safety profile of Mavacamten.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy has been evaluated to slow down the disease progression in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but there is scarce evidence available to date. Therefore, our meta-analysis aimed to explore the efficacy of ARB therapy as a potential disease-modifying treatment in patients with HCM. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases from inception to December 13th, 2021. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The quality of included studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Primary outcomes included the reduction in left ventricular mass and improvement in other echocardiographic features of myocardial dysfunction. The secondary outcome was a net reduction in systolic blood pressure. Meta-analysis was performed using pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 1286 articles were screened. Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria representing a total of 397 patients with HCM (195 patients were in the ARB group). ARB treatment was associated with significant reduction in left ventricular mass (SMD: -0.77; 95% CI: -1.40, -0.03; p = 0.04). ARB therapy was also associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SMD: -0.33; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.05: p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: ARB therapy is associated with a marked reduction in left ventricular mass and systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We recommend further studies with a larger patient population size to confirm the findings of our meta-analysis. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: OSF Registries, DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/DAS7C.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (S-ICDs) are attractive for preventing sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as they mitigate risks of transvenous leads in young patients. However, S-ICDs may be associated with increased inappropriate shock (IAS) in HCM patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and predictors of appropriate shock and IAS in a contemporary HCM S-ICD cohort. METHODS: We collected electrocardiographic and clinical data from HCM patients who underwent S-ICD implantation at 4 centers. Etiologies of all S-ICD shocks were adjudicated. We used Firth penalized logistic regression to derive adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for predictors of IAS. RESULTS: Eighty-eight HCM patients received S-ICDs (81 for primary and 7 for secondary prevention) with a mean follow-up of 2.7 years. Five patients (5.7%) had 9 IAS episodes (3.8 IAS per 100 patient-years) most often because of sinus tachycardia and/or T-wave oversensing. Independent predictors of IAS were higher 12-lead electrocardiographic R-wave amplitude (aOR 2.55 per 1 mV; 95% confidence interval 1.15-6.38) and abnormal T-wave inversions (aOR 0.16; 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.97). There were 2 appropriate shocks in 7 secondary prevention patients and none in 81 primary prevention patients, despite 96% meeting Enhanced American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association criteria and the mean European HCM Risk-SCD score predicting 5.7% 5-year risk. No patients had sudden death or untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter HCM S-ICD study, IAS were rare and appropriate shocks confined to secondary prevention patients. The R-wave amplitude increased IAS risk, whereas T-wave inversions were protective. HCM primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator guidelines overestimated the risk of appropriate shocks in our cohort.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Surgical myectomy has been successfully used to treat patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). More recently, alcohol septal ablation has been advocated as a less invasive, but equally effective alternative therapy. The aim of this non-randomized cohort study was to compare subjective and objective outcomes in patients undergoing these therapies. METHODS: Forty-four patients (25 male; age 41+/-15 years) with symptomatic drug-refractory obstructive HCM were studied. Twenty-four patients underwent surgical myectomy and 20 alcohol septal ablation. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, echocardiography and upright maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing using a cycle ergometer before and following their intervention. RESULTS: Peak gradient was reduced to a similar extent by both modalities (myectomy: 83+/-23 to 15+/-10 mmHg (P<0.000001); ablation: 91+/-18 to 22+/-14 mmHg (P<0.000002);P =0.48 for myectomy vs ablation) and led to similar improvements in NYHA class (myectomy: 2.4+/-0.6 to 1.5+/-0.7 (P<0.00001); ablation: 2.3+/-0.5 to 1.7+/-0.8 (P<0.0001);P=0.3 for myectomy vs ablation). Myectomy resulted in a greater improvement in peak oxygen consumption (myectomy: 16.4+/-5.8 to 23.1+/-7.1 ml.kg(-1) min(-1) (P<0.00002); ablation: 16.2+/-5.2 to 19.3+/-6.1 ml.kg(-1) min(-1) (P<0.05);P <0.05 for myectomy vs ablation) and work rate achieved (myectomy: 130+/-57 to 161+/-60 watts (P<0.04); ablation: 121+/-53 to 137+/-51 watts (P=0.11);P <0.05 for myectomy vs ablation). CONCLUSION: Surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are equally effective at reducing obstruction and subjective exercise limitation in appropriately selected patients. However, the superior effect of surgical myectomy on exercise test parameters suggests that surgery remains the gold standard against which new treatment modalities should be compared.",

However, the full extent of mavacamten's effects on exercise performance remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of mavacamten on exercise physiology using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Exploratory analyses of the data from the EXPLORER-HCM study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was conducted in 68 cardiovascular centers in 13 countries. In total, 251 patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to mavacamten or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The following prespecified exploratory cardiovascular and performance parameters were assessed with a standardized treadmill or bicycle ergometer test protocol at baseline and week 30: carbon dioxide output (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), peak VE/VCO2 ratio, ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope), peak respiratory exchange ratio (RER), peak circulatory power, ventilatory power, ventilatory threshold, peak metabolic equivalents (METs), peak exercise time, partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), and VO2/workload slope. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-one patients were enrolled. The mean (SD) age was 58.5 (11.9) years and 59% of patients were male. There were significant improvements with mavacamten vs placebo in the following peak-exercise CPET parameters: peak VE/VCO2 ratio (least squares [LS] mean difference, -2.2; 95% CI, -3.05 to -1.26; P < .001), peak METs (LS mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.17-0.60; P < .001), peak circulatory power (LS mean difference, 372.9 mL/kg/min × mm Hg; 95% CI, 153.12-592.61; P = .001), and peak PETCO2 (LS mean difference, 2.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.12-2.79; P < .001). Mavacamten also improved peak exercise time compared with placebo (LS mean difference, 0.7 minutes; 95% CI, 0.13-1.24; P = .02). There was a significant improvement in nonpeak-exercise CPET parameters, such as VE/VCO2 slope (LS mean difference, -2.6; 95% CI, -3.58 to -1.52; P < .001) and ventilatory power (LS mean difference, 0.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P < .001) favoring mavacamten vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mavacamten improved a range of CPET parameters beyond pVO2, indicating consistent and broad benefits on maximal exercise capacity. Although improvements in peak-exercise CPET parameters are clinically meaningful, the favorable effects of mavacamten on submaximal exertional tolerance provide further insights into the beneficial impact of mavacamten in patients with obstructive HCM.

A second validated model, PRIMaCY, also provides individualized estimates of risk, but its performance and clinical impact has not been independently investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical impact of using the PRIMaCY sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk model in childhood HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: The estimated 5-year SCD risk was calculated for children meeting diagnostic criteria for HCM in a large single-centre cohort using PRIMaCY (clinical and genetic) and HCM Risk-Kids model, and model performance was assessed. Three hundred one patients [median age 10 (interquartile range 4-14)] were followed up for an average of 4.9 (±3.8) years, during which 30 (10.0%) reached the SCD or equivalent event endpoint. Harrell's C-statistic for the clinical and genetic models was 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.8] and 0.66 (95% CI 0.54-0.80) with a calibration slope of 0.19 (95% CI 0.04-0.54) and 0.26 (95% CI -0.03-0.62), respectively. The number needed to treat to potentially treat one life-threatening arrhythmia for the PRIMaCY clinical, PRIMaCY genetic, and HCM Risk-Kids models was 13.7, 14.5, and 9.4, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although PRIMaCY has a similar discriminatory ability to that reported for HCM Risk-Kids, estimated risk estimates did not correlate well with observed risk. A higher proportion of patients met implantable cardioverter-defibrillator thresholds using PRIMaCY model compared with HCM Risk-Kids. This has important clinical implications as these patients will be exposed to a lifetime risk of complications and inappropriate therapies.",

        "Abstract Note": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disease commonly caused by pathogenic genetic variants encoding sarcomere proteins. Mavacamten, a first-in-class allosteric inhibitor of cardiac-specific myosin, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in international clinical trials of patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM (oHCM) but clinical evidence for mavacamten in the Chinese population is lacking. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: EXPLORER-CN is a multicentre, phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavacamten in Chinese adults with symptomatic oHCM. The study will enrol approximately 81 participants with symptomatic oHCM. Eligible participants are randomised 2:1 to receive once-daily, oral mavacamten (starting dose 2.5 mg/day), or matching placebo, for 30 weeks, followed by a long-term extension (LTE) period of 48 weeks with active treatment for all subjects. The mavacamten dose will be adjusted by pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters during the double-blinded, placebo-controlled period and PD-only during the LTE period. The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline to week 30 in Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) peak gradient determined by Doppler echocardiography. Secondary efficacy endpoints are change in resting LVOT peak gradient, proportion of participants achieving a Valsalva LVOT peak gradient <30 or < 50 mm Hg, New York Heart Association functional class improvement, change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score, cardiac biomarkers and left ventricular mass index evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance. LTE endpoints will characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of mavacamten. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This clinical study has been approved by the Drug Clinical Trial Ethics Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Hospital (reference number: HS2021089). Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented during national and international conferences.

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: The recent American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guidelines on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have confirmed surgical myectomy as the gold standard for non-pharmacological treatment of obstructive HCM. However, during the last 15 years, an extensive use of alcohol septal ablation has led to the virtual extinction of myectomy programmes in several European countries. Therefore, many HCM candidates for myectomy in Europe cannot be offered the option of this procedure. The purpose of our study is to report the difficulties and results in developing a myectomy programme for HCM in a centre without previous experience with this procedure. METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical course is reported of 124 consecutive patients with obstructive HCM and heart failure symptoms who underwent myectomy at a single European centre between 1996 and 2010. The median follow-up was 20.3 months (inter-quartile range: 3.9-40.6 months). No patients were lost to follow-up. A cumulative incidence of HCM-related death after myectomy was 0.8, 3.3, and 11.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, including one operative death (procedural mortality 0.8%). The left ventricular (LV) outflow gradient decreased from 95 ± 36 mmHg before surgery to 12 ± 6 mmHg at most recent evaluation (P < 0.001), with none of the patients having a significant residual LV outflow gradient. Of the 97 patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV before surgery, 93 (96%) were in class I-II at most recent evaluation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results show that the development of a myectomy programme at a centre without previous experience with this procedure is feasible and can lead to highly favourable clinical results.",

METHODS: The study population comprised 70 young patients with HCM (mean (SD) age 29.4 (5.9) years) with mild septal hypertrophy (15-19 mm) and 85 age and sex matched athletes with septal thickness >12 mm, followed up for 44.4 (10.8) months. Using pulsed DMI, myocardial peak velocities, systolic time intervals, and myocardial intraventricular and interventricular systolic delays were measured in six different basal myocardial segments. RESULTS: DMI analysis showed in HCM lower myocardial both systolic and early diastolic peak velocities of all the segments. Patients with HCM also showed significant interventricular and intraventricular delay (p<0.0001), whereas athletes showed homogeneous systolic activation of the ventricular walls. During the follow up, seven sudden deaths occurred in the HCM group, while no cardiovascular event was observed in the group of athletes. In patients with HCM, intraventricular delay on DMI was the most powerful independent predictor of sudden cardiac death (p<0.0001). An intraventricular delay >45 ms identified with high sensitivity and specificity patients with HCM at higher risk of ventricular tachycardia and cardiac events (test accuracy 90.6%). CONCLUSIONS: DMI may be a valid supporting tool for the differential diagnosis between HCM and \"athlete's heart\". In patients with HCM, DMI indexes of intraventricular delay may provide additional information for selecting subgroups of patients with HCM at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death at follow up. Accordingly, such patients may benefit from early intensive treatment and survey. MINIABSTRACT: Doppler myocardial imaging may represent a valid supporting tool for the differential diagnosis between mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and \"athlete's heart\". In patients with HCM, DMI indexes of intraventricular delay may provide additional information for selecting subgroups of patients with HCM at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death at follow up.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Despite hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) being the most common inherited heart disease and conferring increased risk for heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD), risk assessment in HCM patients is still largely unresolved. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to synthesize and compare the prognostic impact of demographic, clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings in patients with HCM. METHODS: The authors searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies published from 1955 to November 2020, and the endpoints were: 1) all-cause death; 2) an arrhythmic endpoint including SCD, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or aborted SCD; and 3) a composite endpoint including (1) or (2) plus hospitalization for HF or cardiac transplantation. The authors performed a pairwise meta-analysis obtaining the pooled estimate separately for the association between baseline variables and study endpoints. A random-effects network meta-analysis was subsequently used to comparatively assess the prognostic value of outcome associates. RESULTS: A total of 112 studies with 58,732 HCM patients were included. Among others, increased brain natriuretic peptide/N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), positive genotype, impaired global longitudinal strain, and presence of apical aneurysm conferred increased risk for the composite endpoint. At network meta-analysis, LGE showed the highest prognostic value for all endpoints and was superior to all other associates except New York Heart Association functional class >class II. A multiparametric imaging-based model was superior in predicting the composite endpoint compared to a prespecified model based on conventional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis supports the development of multiparametric risk prediction algorithms, including advanced imaging markers additively to conventional risk factors, for refined risk stratification in HCM.

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Whether pregnancy is a modifier of the long-term course and outcome of women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is unknown. We assessed the association of pregnancy with long-term outcomes in HCM women. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective evaluation of women with HCM from 1970 to 2021. Only women with pregnancy-related information (pregnancy present or absent) and a follow-up period lasting ≥1 year were included. The peri-partum period was defined as -1 to 6 months after delivery. The primary endpoint was a composite for major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE: cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death, appropriate defibrillator shock and heart failure (HF) progression]. Overall, 379 (58%) women were included. There were 432 pregnancies in 242 (63%) patients. In 29 (7.6%) cases, pregnancies (n = 39) occurred after HCM diagnosis. Among these, three carrying likely pathogenic sarcomeric variants suffered MACEs in the peri-partum period. At 10 ± 9 years of follow-up, age at diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR) 1.034, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.018-1.050, P < 0.001] and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (II vs. I: HR 1.944, 95% CI 0.896-4.218; III vs. I: HR 5.291, 95% CI 2.392-11.705, P < 0.001) were associated with MACE. Conversely, pregnancy was associated with reduced risk (HR 0.605; 95% CI 0.380-0.963, P = 0.034). Among women with pregnancy, multiple occurrences did not modify risk. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is not a modifier of long-term outcome in women with HCM and mostly occurs before a cardiac diagnosis. Most patients tolerate pregnancy well and do not show a survival disadvantage compared to women without. Pregnancy should not be discouraged, except in the presence of severe HF symptoms or high-risk features.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in myofilament proteins, most commonly MYBPC3-encoded myosin-binding protein C and MYH7-encoded beta-myosin heavy chain, can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Despite significant advances in structure-function relationships pertaining to the cardiac sarcomere, there is limited knowledge of how a mutation leads to clinical HCM. We, therefore, set out to study expression and localization of myofilament proteins in left ventricular tissue of patients with HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Frozen surgical myectomy specimens from 47 patients with HCM were examined and genotyped for mutations involving 8 myofilament-encoding genes. Myofilament protein levels were quantified by Western blotting with localization graded from immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections. Overall, 25 of 47 (53%) patients had myofilament-HCM, including 12 with MYBPC3-HCM and 9 with MYH7-HCM. As compared with healthy heart tissue, levels of myofilament proteins were increased in patients manifesting a mutation in either gene. Patients with a frameshift mutation predicted to truncate MYBPC3 exhibited marked disturbances in protein localization as compared with missense mutations in either MYBPC3 or MYH7. CONCLUSIONS: In this first expression study in human HCM tissue, increased myofilament protein levels in patients with either MYBPC3- or MYH7-mediated HCM suggest a poison peptide mechanism. Specifically, the mechanism of dysfunction may vary according to the genetic subgroup suggested by a distinctly abnormal distribution of myofilament proteins in patients manifesting a truncation mutation in MYBPC3.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: An association between obesity, metabolic abnormalities and clinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) expression has been reported. We investigated whether managing dyslipidaemia with fibrates could affect the clinical expression of HCM. METHODS: We screened patients who used fibrates between 2010 and 2017 from a nationwide database. After excluding patients with a history of HCM, we identified fibrate-user group (n = 412 823). We then constructed a 1:1 matched cohort of fibrate-naïve participants (n = 412 823). After a 1 year lag period, we identified the incident HCM cases for the following 5 years. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 3.96 years, we identified 454 incident clinical HCM cases. After adjusting for covariates, fibrate use was associated with a lower risk of clinical HCM expression [hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.763 (0.630-0.924)]. In subgroup analyses, fibrate use was associated with a reduced risk of clinical HCM expression in patients with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 and those with abdominal obesity [HR (95% CI): 0.719 (0.553-0.934) and 0.655 (0.492-0.872)], but not in those without obesity. Fibrate use was also associated with lower risks of incident clinical HCM in patients with triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL and those with metabolic syndrome [HR (95% CI): 0.741 (0.591-0.929) and 0.750 (0.609-0.923)], but not in their counterparts. Regarding lifestyle behaviours, fibrate use appeared to provide more prognostic benefits in patients who currently smoked, consumed alcohol or did not engage in regular physical activities. CONCLUSION: The use of fibrates is associated with a lower incidence of clinical HCM expression. This association was also more prominent in those with obesity, unhealthy metabolic profiles and poor lifestyle behaviours.",

        "Abstract Note": "In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation and diastolic filling have been reported. Therefore, we determined LV diastolic stiffness in nine patients with HCM before and 10 to 15 min after 0.15 mg/kg propranolol i.v. (group 1) and in six patients with HCM before and 10 to 15 min after 0.1 mg/kg verapamil i.v. (group 2). Simultaneous LV cineangiography and high-fidelity pressure measurements were performed in group 1 and simultaneous M-mode echocardiography and high-fidelity pressure measurements in group 2. Passive LV chamber stiffness was determined in group 1 from the diastolic pressure-volume data using an exponential three-parameter model: P = ae beta V + C, where P = pressure, alpha = intercept, beta = constant of chamber stiffness, V = volume and C = baseline pressure. Passive LV myocardial stiffness was estimated in group 2 from the diastolic stress-strain data using a viscoelastic model: sigma = alpha' (e beta' epsilon -1) + eta epsilon, where sigma = meridional wall stress, alpha = intercept, beta' = constant of myocardial stiffness, epsilon = midwall strain, eta = constant of myocardial viscosity and epsilon = strain rate. LV relaxation was assessed from the time constant of LV pressure decay (T) by plotting LV pressure versus negative dP/dt. LV diastolic filling was evaluated from peak and mean LV filling rate in group 1 and from peak and mean midwall lengthening rate in group 2. LV chamber and myocardial stiffness, respectively, remained unchanged before and after administration of propranolol (beta = 0.054 and 0.047) and verapamil (beta' = 14.8 and 12.6); however, the time constant of LV pressure decay T increased significantly in group 1 from 45 to 66 ms (P less than 0.05) and decreased significantly in group 2 from 53 to 43 ms (P less than 0.05). Parallel to the changes in LV isovolumic relaxation, mean LV diastolic filling rate decreased significantly in group 1 from 257 to 196 ml m-2 s-1 (P less than 0.025) and mean LV midwall lengthening rate increased significantly in group 2 from 2.37 to 4.31 cm/sec (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that LV diastolic stiffness remains unchanged in patients with HCM after propranolol and verapamil. LV relaxation and mean diastolic filling, however, are impaired in patients with HCM following propranolol but are improved after verapamil. Thus, the beneficial effect of verapamil on diastolic mechanics is related to improved relaxation and diastolic filling rather than to changes in LV diastolic stiffness.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of life and well-being of cardiac arrest survivors who have received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or other treatment. METHODS: 168 patients were monitored for 1 year and completed four questionnaires. RESULTS: No differences were found between the two treatments regarding quality of life (except for pain, ICD patients perceived less pain) and well-being. A significant improvement in physical and social function, and in mental health was found in the first 6 months. Older patients (60 years or older) perceived less improvement in their health than younger patients. Women reported having poorer social function. The prevalence of anxiety and probable depression was high irrespective of the treatment received: anxiety and depressive symptoms did not change significantly between 1 and 12 months after discharge. Patients with higher anxiety scores experienced less improvement in health and patients with more depressive symptoms experienced poorer social function. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and probable depression was high in cardiac arrest survivors. Probable depression affected social function. Those patients who felt anxious experienced less health improvement. Quality of life and well-being were not affected by the type of treatment. We conclude that surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has a greater impact on patients than the treatment received.",

        "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.120.007022",
        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease. While ≈50% of patients with HCM carry a sarcomere gene mutation (sarcomere mutation-positive, HCMSMP), the genetic background is unknown in the other half of the patients (sarcomere mutation-negative, HCMSMN). Genotype-specific differences have been reported in cardiac function. Moreover, HCMSMN patients have later disease onset and a better prognosis than HCMSMP patients. To define if genotype-specific derailments at the protein level may explain the heterogeneity in disease development, we performed a proteomic analysis in cardiac tissue from a clinically well-phenotyped HCM patient group. METHODS: A proteomics screen was performed in cardiac tissue from 39 HCMSMP patients, 11HCMSMN patients, and 8 nonfailing controls. Patients with HCM had obstructive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. A novel MYBPC32373insG mouse model was used to confirm functional relevance of our proteomic findings. RESULTS: In all HCM patient samples, we found lower levels of metabolic pathway proteins and higher levels of extracellular matrix proteins. Levels of total and detyrosinated α-tubulin were markedly higher in HCMSMP than in HCMSMN and controls. Higher tubulin detyrosination was also found in 2 unrelated MYBPC3 mouse models and its inhibition with parthenolide normalized contraction and relaxation time of isolated cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that microtubules and especially its detyrosination contribute to the pathomechanism of patients with HCMSMP. This is of clinical importance since it represents a potential treatment target to improve cardiac function in patients with HCMSMP, whereas a beneficial effect may be limited in patients with HCMSMN.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The comparative outcomes of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) and transvenous ICD (T-ICD) have not been well studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of currently available S-ICD and T-ICD. METHODS: The study included 86 patients who received an S-ICD and 1:1 matched to those who received single-chamber T-ICD by gender, age, diagnosis, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and implant year. The clinical outcomes and implant complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the 172 patients was 45 years, and 129 (75%) were male. The most common cardiac condition was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, 37.8%). The mean LVEF was 50%. At a mean follow-up of 23 months, the appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapy rate were 1.2% vs. 4.7% (χ = 1.854, P = 0.368) and 9.3% vs. 3.5% (χ = 2.428, P = 0.211) in S-ICD and T-ICD groups respectively. There were no significant differences in device-related major and minor complications between the two groups (7.0% vs. 3.5%, χ = 1.055, P = 0.496). The S-ICD group had higher T-wave oversensing than T-ICD group (9.3% vs. 0%, χ = 8.390, P = 0.007). Sixty-five patients had HCM (32 in S-ICD and 33 in T-ICD). The incidence of major complications was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of an S-ICD is comparable to that of T-ICD, especially in a dominantly HCM patient population. The S-ICD is associated with fewer major complications demanding reoperation.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex-associated differences in the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) undergoing septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from the TriNetX research database. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify patients with HCM who underwent septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation in the United States between January 2002 and March 2023. The outcomes were long-term mortality and postprocedural complications (<30 days), including death, stroke, major bleeding, and renal failure. Multivariable adjusted Cox models were used to assess the association of outcomes by sex, taking female patients as reference. RESULTS: Of 11,680 adults (32.0% female; median age, 63 [interquartile range, 54 to 71] years), 1916 (16.4%) and 9764 (83.6%) underwent septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation, respectively. For those who underwent septal myectomy, sex was not associated with short-term (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj], 1.57 [0.64 to 3.87]) and long-term (HRadj, 1.05 [0.87 to 1.26]) mortality. Male patients had a higher risk of acute renal failure compared with female patients after septal myectomy (HRadj, 1.69 [1.33 to 2.15]). Of those who underwent alcohol septal ablation, male patients (HRadj, 1.07 [0.99 to 1.16]) had a similar risk of long-term mortality to that of female patients. Compared with female patients, the risk of acute renal failure was higher in male patients (HRadj, 1.23 [1.02 to 1.48]) after alcohol septal ablation. CONCLUSION: This nationwide study found that the risk of short- and long-term mortality was similar for male and female patients undergoing septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation for HCM.

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: We sought to assess the relationship between left atrial (LA) strain mechanics and exercise intolerance, and to evaluate the prognostic impact of LA strain mechanics on clinical deterioration necessitating septal reduction therapy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive HCM patients who underwent exercise stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing on the same day between October 2015 and April 2019 were enrolled prospectively. LA strain mechanics were analysed using speckle tracking echocardiography. LA stiffness was calculated as the ratio of E/e' ratio to LA reservoir strain. The study cohort was divided into four groups based on the quartile of percent-predicted peak VO2, and exercise intolerance was defined as the lowest quartile (≤51%). Of 532 patients studied (mean age: 51 ± 15 years, 42% female), 138 patients demonstrated exercise intolerance. As exercise capacity worsened, LA strain mechanics worsened along a continuum (P < 0.001). LA contractile strain with a cut-off of -13.9% was optimal at identifying exercise intolerance. On multivariable analysis, worse LA contractile strain was an independent predictor for exercise intolerance (P = 0.002). Of patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, patients with LA stiffness worse than the median value (≥0.41) were significantly more likely to require septal reduction therapy than those with better LA stiffness (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Worse LA contractile strain was an independent predictor for exercise intolerance in HCM. Patients with worse LA stiffness had a higher probability of clinical deterioration necessitating septal reduction therapy.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: In severely symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, VALOR-HCM (A Study to Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Who Are Eligible for Septal Reduction Therapy) demonstrated that mavacamten reduces the need for septal reduction therapy with sustained improvement in left ventricular (LV) outflow tract gradients and symptoms. Global longitudinal strain (GLS), a measure of regional myocardial function, is a more sensitive marker of systolic function. In VALOR-HCM, we assessed serial changes in LV and right ventricular (RV) strain. METHODS: VALOR-HCM included 112 patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mean, 60 years; 51% male; LV ejection fraction, 68%). Patients assigned to mavacamten at baseline continued the drug for 56 weeks (n=56) and those assigned to placebo (n=52) transitioned to mavacamten from weeks 16 to 56 (40-week exposure). LV-GLS and RV-GLS assessment was performed using a vendor-neutral software. Non-foreshortened apical (4-, 3-, and 2-chamber) views were used to obtain peak LV-GLS. RV focused 4-chamber view was used to calculate RV 4-chamber and free wall strain. A more negative strain value is favorable. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean LV-GLS, RV 4-chamber, and free wall strain values were -14.7%, -22.2%, and -16.8%, respectively (all worse than reported normal means). In the total study sample, LV-GLS significantly improved from baseline to week 56 (P=0.02). Twelve patients had transient reduction in LV ejection fraction (<50%) requiring temporary drug interruption (including 3 permanent discontinuations). The LV-GLS in this subgroup was worse at baseline versus total study population (-11.4%), with no significant worsening from baseline through week 56 (P=0.64). Both free wall and 4-chamber RV-GLS remained unchanged from baseline to week 56 (P=0.62 and P=0.56, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In VALOR-HCM, treatment with mavacamten improved LV-GLS from baseline through week 56 (with no significant worsening of LV-GLS in patients with a reduction in LV ejection fraction ≤50%), suggesting a favorable long-term impact on regional LV systolic function. Additionally, there was no detrimental impact on RV systolic function. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04349072.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: We have previously reported our 3-step repair for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) consisting of resection of the septum, horizontal plication of the anterior mitral leaflet (AML), and release of abnormal papillary muscle attachments. This article reviews our complete experience with surgical management of HCM to better understand the role and relevance of mitral plication. METHODS: From 1997 to 2011, 132 patients with HCM underwent surgical treatment at our institution. Eighty-two patients (62%) received AML plication based on selection criteria and were classified as group A; patients in group B did not receive plication. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative echocardiography. Long-term clinical follow-up was obtained by review of scheduled echocardiograms and direct patient interview. RESULTS: The average age of all patients was 55.5 years. Operative mortality was 0%. The mean left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient decreased from 118±41 mm Hg to 6±13 mm Hg (p<0.0001). Mean mitral regurgitation improved from 2.4±1.0 to 0.5±0.7 (p<0.0001). Postoperatively, 96.2% of patients had no residual systolic anterior motion (SAM). Significant improvements in heart failure classification and quality of life scores were noted for all patients. Comparison of groups A and B showed no statistically significant differences in outcomes, complications, or survival. Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 98%, 98%, and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of the pathologic process in HCM supports detailed analysis of the septum, mitral leaflets, and subvalvular apparatus. Surgical management of HCM that includes horizontal plication of a lax and elongated AML is safe and results in durable clinical and echocardiographic improvement.",

RESULTS: No significant improvement was identified in the composite z-score between the 2 groups at 12-month follow-up (P = .4). With the exception of tissue Doppler systolic (s') velocity, we found no significant benefit or harm from losartan compared to placebo for any of the individual components of the composite score at 12-month follow-up. Results were similar in analyses without imputed data or when restricted to patients with sarcomeric HCM. CONCLUSION: Despite applying the potentially more sensitive composite z-score endpoint as in the VANISH trial, no statistically significant benefits from the use of losartan compared to placebo could be detected at 12-month follow-up in patients with overt HCM participating in the INHERIT trial.",

        "Abstract Note": "Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are well established treatment options for severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were excluded from pivotal randomized controlled trials of TAVR vs SAVR. We queried the 2016 to 2019 National Inpatient Sample to identify adult hospitalizations with HCM who underwent SAVR or TAVR for severe AS. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiac arrest, new permanent pacemaker (PPM), cardiac tamponade, bleeding requiring transfusion, stroke/transient ischemic attack, acute kidney injury (AKI), and resource utilization (length of stay [LOS], hospital costs, and discharge to facility). Of 1245 HCM hospitalizations with severe AS, 595(47.8%) underwent TAVR and 650 (52.2%) underwent SAVR. In-hospital mortality rate was lower in the TAVR group. Cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, pressor use, new PPM, and cardiac tamponade were not significantly different between the 2 groups. When compared to SAVR, TAVR was associated with lower rates of bleeding requiring transfusion, vascular complications, AKI, and invasive mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, TAVR was associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer facility discharges, but comparable hospital costs. Our findings indicate that TAVR is associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality, certain peri-procedural complications, shorter hospital stay, and fewer facility discharges in HCM patients with isolated AS compared to SAVR. Further studies are needed to assess the mid- and long-term outcomes of TAVR vs SAVR in HCM patients with AS.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation (CA) is a treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We investigated the electrophysiological characteristics of recurrence in a tertiary referral center and compared long-term clinical outcomes after CA therapy with patients who did not undergo CA. METHODS: Patients with HCM and AF who underwent CA (group 1, n = 60) or pharmacological treatment (group 2, n = 298) between 2006 and 2021 were enrolled in this study. The baseline characteristics and electrophysiological characteristics of group 1 patients were examined to elucidate the reason for the recurrence of AF after CA therapy. The clinical results of the patients in Group 1 and Group 2 were compared using a propensity score (PS)-matched method. RESULTS: The most common cause of recurrence was pulmonary vein reconnection (86.5%), followed by non-pulmonary vein triggers (40.5%), cavotricuspid isthmus flutter (29.7%), and atypical flutter (24.3%). Thyroid disease (HR, 14.713; P < 0.01), diabetes (HR, 3.074; P = 0.03), and non-paroxysmal AF (HR, 4.012; P = 0.01); these factors independently predicted recurrence. After the first recurrence, patients who underwent repeat CA showed a better arrhythmia-free state (74.1%) than those who underwent drug escalation therapy (29.4%, P < 0.01). After matching, PS-group 1 patients showed significantly better outcomes in all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and left atrial reverse remodeling than PS-group 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent CA showed better clinical outcomes than those who underwent drug therapy. The main predictors of recurrence were thyroid disease, diabetes, and non-paroxysmal AF.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The VANISH trial (Valsartan for Attenuating Disease Evolution in Early Sarcomeric Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) targeted young sarcomeric gene mutation carriers with early-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) to test whether valsartan can modify disease progression. We describe the baseline characteristics of the VANISH cohort and compare to previous trials evaluating angiotensin receptor blockers. METHODS: Applying a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design, 178 participants with nonobstructive HCM (age, 23.3±10.1 years; 61% men) were randomized in the primary cohort and 34 (age, 16.5±4.9 years; 50% men) in the exploratory cohort of sarcomeric mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS: In the primary cohort, maximal left ventricular wall thickness was 17±4 mm for adults and Z score 7.0±4.5 for children. Nineteen percent had late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance. Mean peak oxygen consumption was 33 mL/kg per minute, and 92% of participants were New York Heart Association functional class I. New York Heart Association class II was associated with older age, MYH7 variants, and more prominent imaging abnormalities. Six previous trials of angiotensin receptor blockers in HCM enrolled a median of 24 patients (range, 19-133) with mean age of 51.2 years; 42% of patients were in New York Heart Association class ≥II, and sarcomeric mutations were not required. CONCLUSIONS: The VANISH cohort is much larger, younger, less heterogeneous, and has less advanced disease than prior angiotensin receptor blocker trials in HCM. Participants had relatively normal functional capacity and mild HCM features. New York Heart Association functional class II symptoms were associated with older age, more prominent imaging abnormalities, and MYH7 variants, suggesting both phenotype and genotype contribute to disease manifestations.

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: The experiences of patients who received shocks from their implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and how these events affect their overall adjustment are poorly understood. Our goal was to evaluate quality of life and psychological well-being, and the prevalence of, and changes in, depression and anxiety of patients who did or did not experience defibrillatory shocks in the first 12 months after ICD implantation. In total 167 patients were monitored after discharge. Four self-administered questionnaires were used. The first assessment took place before ICD implantation, the remaining three at 1, 6 and 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: We classified patients into three shock groups and one no shock group. A small group of ICD recipients (26%) received ICD shock delivery, usually during the last 6 months of the study. Borderline significant differences were found within the groups over time regarding physical role limitations (P < 0.051). Those who experienced shocks throughout the year (group 1) felt more limited in their daily activities due to physical or mental problems. All groups health (P < 0.001). Overall quality of life did not change significantly after 6 months. Anxiety and depression did not change significantly over time. In total 22-66% of patients reported clinically significant depressive symptoms throughout the first year, and 31-83% clinically significant symptoms of anxiety. ICD recipients who had experienced a shock were significantly more anxious one-year postdischarge than those who had not received a shock. CONCLUSIONS: Overall quality of life and psychological well-being did not change in ICD recipients, irrespective of whether they experienced defibrillatory shocks. The high prevalence of depression and anxiety can be interpreted as a response to the perceived physical and mental problems regarding daily activities. Our data indicate that patients who have experienced an ICD shock do not adapt well to living with an ICD, they are more anxious than ICD recipients who received no shocks. However, the anticipation of having another shock after experiencing one is less stressful than that of the first shock. We conclude that the lasting psychological distress will not dissipate spontaneously or naturally and that psychosocial interventions may be warranted.",

        "Abstract Note": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) represents a major cause of hospitalization and death. Recent evidence shows that novel biomarkers such as soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST2), growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) are correlated with inflammatory and ischemic responses in CHF patients. In this study we examined the effects of Ivabradine that inhibited the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel, also called funny current If), thereby leading to selective heart rate reduction and improved myocardial oxygen supply on the cardiac biomarkers sST2, GDF-15, suPAR and H-FABP in 50 CHF patients at the University Hospital of Jena. Patients were divided into three groups based on the etiology of CHF: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=20), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, n=20) and hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HCM, n=10). The patients were administered Ivabradine (5 mg, bid for 3 months, and 7.5 mg bid for further 3 months). Analyses of cardiovascular biomarkers were performed at baseline as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. At 6-month follow-up, GDF-15 levels were significantly reduced compared to baseline levels (P=0.0215), indicating a reduction in the progress of cardiac remodeling. H-FABP concentration was significantly lower in DCM patients compared to ICM (1.89 vs 3.24 μg/mL) and HCM patients (1.89 vs 3.80 μg/mL), and decreased over the 6-month follow-up (P=0.0151). suPAR median levels remained elevated, implying major ongoing inflammatory processes. As shown by significant decreases in GDF-15 and H-FABP levels, a reduction in ventricular remodeling and sub-clinical ischemia could be assumed. However, markers of hemodynamic stress (sST2) and inflammation (suPAR) showed no change or progression after 6 months of Ivabradine treatment in CHF patients. Further studies are necessary to validate the clinical applicability of these novel cardiovascular biomarkers.",

Because mavacamten improves ventricular compliance, this sub-study examined the effects of treatment with this cardiac myosin inhibitor on diastolic function. METHODS: Symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy referred for septal reduction therapy were randomized 1:1 to mavacamten or placebo. At baseline and week 16, a resting and stress echocardiogram was performed with interpretation by a core laboratory. In this exploratory substudy, the principal end point was the change in parameters used to define the grade of diastolic function in patients treated with mavacamten and placebo. A related objective was to assess the proportion of patients with an improvement in diastolic function grade. A secondary aim was to assess for correlation between diastolic function parameters and the secondary end points from VALOR-HCM: New York Heart Association class, quality of life, and cardiac biomarkers. RESULTS: Diastolic dysfunction grade was evaluable in 98 patients at baseline and week 16. Among patients treated with mavacamten, 29.4% (15 of 51) demonstrated improvement in diastolic function grade compared with 12.8% (6 of 47) patients with placebo (P=0.05). Average E/e' ratio decreased significantly in patients treated with mavacamten (-3.4±5.3) compared with placebo (0.57±3.5; P<0.001). Indexed left atrial volumes (mL/m2) also decreased significantly in patients who received mavacamten (-5.2±7.8) compared with placebo (-0.51±8.1; P=0.005). After adjustment for change in left ventricular outflow tract gradient and mitral regurgitation, mavacamten was significantly associated with a decrease in average E/e' ratio and indexed left atrial volumes. Change in average E/e' ratio was significantly correlated with the secondary end points from VALOR-HCM. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory substudy, after 16 weeks of therapy, mavacamten improved diastolic function, and this change correlated with improvement in clinical and biomarker end points.

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the characteristics of longitudinal strain and its effect on outcomes in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who underwent septal myectomy. METHODS: We reviewed patients with obstructive HCM who underwent septal myectomy at our clinic from 2007 to 2016. Data of those who had strain echocardiography within 6 months before isolated myectomy were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the 857 patients studied was 55 (interquartile range [IQR], 44-63) years, and 451 (52.6%) were male. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 71% (IQR, 67%-74%), and the resting peak outflow tract gradient was 58 (IQR, 27-85) mm Hg. The median global longitudinal strain (GLS) was -14.6% (IQR, -12.0% to -17.3%). Regional longitudinal strain was nonuniform as reflected by more normal values in apical segments and more abnormal in basal segments. Moreover, GLS correlated poorly with ejection fraction and outflow tract gradient. In 64 patients who had postoperative strain echocardiography, GLS was comparable before and after septal myectomy, but regional strain was more uniform after myectomy. Over a follow-up of 8.3 (IQR, 6.5-10.3) years, when patients were equally stratified according to GLS (cutoff, -14.64%), the group with worse GLS had significantly poorer survival compared with the better GLS group (P = .002). Left ventricular ejection fraction had no association with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular longitudinal strain is nonuniform and might be significantly reduced in patients with obstructive HCM. Septal myectomy does not impair GLS but is associated with more uniform regional strains. Most importantly, reduced GLS preoperatively is strongly and independently associated with increased all-cause mortality after septal myectomy for obstructive HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of heart failure in children, but there are limited data addressing outcome of myectomy in children. Our objective was to evaluate the early and late results of septal myectomy in pediatric HCM. METHODS: We reviewed 127 consecutive patients (62% male) who underwent transaortic septal myectomy for obstructive HCM from January 1975 to December 2010 at 21 or less years of age. Mean age at operation was 12.9 ± 5.5 years. Preoperatively, mean maximum instantaneous gradient was 89 mm Hg and 95% had significant systolic anterior motion (SAM) with mitral regurgitation (MR). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and permanent pacemaker prior to surgery was present in 21 patients (17%) and 15 (11.7%), respectively. RESULTS: Transaortic extended left ventricular septal myectomy was performed in all patients with no early deaths. Iatrogenic morbidity included new aortic valve regurgitation requiring repair in 7 (5.5%), mitral regurgitation needing repair in 2 (1.5%), ventricular septal defect in 1 (1%), and heart block requiring permanent pacemaker in 1 (1%). An ICD was implanted postoperatively in 8 during the same hospital admission. Mean MIG decreased from 89 to 6 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). Postoperatively, residual chordal SAM was present in 23% with mild or no MR; moderate MR was detected in 1 patient. Four patients (3%) died late during the mean follow-up period of 8.3 years (maximum, 37 years); 1 death was sudden. Overall survival was 98.6%, 94.9%, 92.4%, and 92.4% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Freedom from any cardiac reoperation was 91.2%, 87.8%, 78.7%, and 72.7% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Repeat septal myectomy was performed in 6 patients (5%). At late follow-up, 95% were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II and 25 patients underwent late ICD placement. CONCLUSIONS: Septal myectomy is safe and effective in children with obstructive HCM, but limited exposure may increase risk of aortic or mitral valve injury. Late survival is better than the previously published untreated natural history of HCM. Patient selection and surgical expertise remain critical components of septal myectomy, especially before considering a prophylactic myectomy in a seemingly asymptomatic patient.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Extended myectomy for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has good long-term results. In addition to the midseptal resection (R) for HCM, our group has introduced a novel variation in anterior leaflet plication (P) and release (R) of papillary muscle attachments. We sought to investigate the medium-term success of this three-step repair that addresses all aspects of complex HCM pathology. METHODS: Nineteen patients underwent resection-plication-release repair for complex HCM pathology. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed on all patients preoperatively and postoperatively to assess adequacy of resection, left ventricular outflow tract gradients, and mitral valve function. All patients underwent transthoracic outpatient echocardiography at a mean follow-up of 2.4 +/- 2.1 years (range, 0.5 to 6). RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 57 +/- 14 years. The preoperative peak LVOTO was 137 +/- 45 mm Hg. The average degree of mitral regurgitation was 3.1. The average length of stay was 7.5 +/- 3.3 days. There were no readmissions or deaths in the group. Initial postoperative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated marked reduction in LVOTO to 10 +/- 17 mm Hg (p < 0.0001) and significant improvement in mitral regurgitation to 0.2 (p < 0.0001). In follow-up, the LVOT gradient remained low at 6 +/- 14 (p > 0.0001) and mitral regurgitation remained insignificant at 0.4 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anterior leaflet plication and papillary muscle release are logical adjuncts to septal resection in the treatment of the complicated pathophysiology of obstructive HCM. Durable long-term results can be achieved with an aggressive approach to mitral valve pathology in conjunction with extended myectomy.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been significantly reduced. Given its widespread use, it is important to identify the outcomes associated with ICD use in patients with HCM. The present paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the rates of appropriate and inappropriate interventions, mortality, and device complications in HCM patients with an ICD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on 27 studies reporting outcomes and complications after ICD implantation in patients with HCM. ICD interventions, device complications, and mortality were extracted for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3,797 patients with HCM and ICD implantation were included (mean age, 44.5 years; 63% male), of which 83% of patients had an ICD for primary prevention of SCD. The cardiac mortality was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.3) per year and non-cardiac mortality was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6-1.2) per year. Annualized appropriate intervention rate was 4.8% and annualized inappropriate intervention was 4.9%. The annual incidence of lead malfunction, lead displacement and infection was 1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ICD use in patients with HCM produces low rates of cardiac and non-cardiac mortality, and an appropriate intervention rate of 4.8% per year. However, moderate rates of inappropriate intervention and device complications warrant careful patient selection in order to optimize the risk to benefit ratio in this select group of patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "Mavacamten is the first cardiac myosin inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The phase III EXPLORER-HCM (NCT03470545) study used a dose-titration scheme based on mavacamten exposure and echocardiographic assessment of Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract gradient (VLVOTg) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Using population pharmacokinetic/exposure-response modeling and simulations of virtual patients, this in silico study evaluated alternative dose-titration regimens for mavacamten, including regimens that were guided by echocardiographic measures only. Mavacamten exposure-response models for VLVOTg (efficacy) and LVEF (safety) were developed using patient data from five clinical studies and characterized using nonlinear mixed-effects models. Simulations of five echocardiography-guided regimens were performed in virtual cohorts constructed based on either expected or equal population distributions of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) metabolizer phenotypes. Each regimen aimed to maximize the proportions of patients who achieved a VLVOTg below 30 mm Hg while maintaining LVEF above 50% over 40 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively. The exposure-response models successfully characterized mavacamten efficacy and safety parameters. Overall, the simulated regimen with the optimal benefit-risk profile across CYP2C19 phenotypes had steps for down-titration at weeks 4 and 8 (for VLVOTg <20 mm Hg), and up-titration at week 12 (for VLVOTg ≥30 mm Hg and LVEF ≥55%), and every 12 weeks thereafter. This simulation-optimized regimen is recommended in the mavacamten US prescribing information.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was primarily to determine efficacy after alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in mildly symptomatic patients (NYHA class II) with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), as compared to medical therapy. METHODS: This retrospective study included 163 mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM evaluated in Beijing Anzhen Hospital between March 2001 and August 2019, consisting of the medical group (n = 105) and the ASA group (n = 58). All-cause mortality and HCM-related death were mainly observed. RESULTS: Follow-up was completed in 161 patients and the median follow-up was 6.0 years. Compared to medically treated patients, patients post-ASA had comparable survival free of all-cause mortality (98.3% and 95.1% vs. 93.0% and 83.1% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.374). Survival free of HCM-related death was also similar between ASA and medical groups (98.3% and 95.1% vs. 94.3% and 86.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.608). However, compared to medical therapy, ASA had advantages on the improvement of NYHA class (1.4 ± 0.6 vs. 2.1 ± 0.5, p = .000) and lower occurrence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (7.8% vs. 20.4%, p = .048). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that resting LVOT gradient at the last clinical check-up was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.021, 95%CI 1.002-1.040, p = .027). CONCLUSION: This registry suggests that mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM treated with ASA have comparable survival to that of medically treated patients, with the improvement of NYHA class and lower occurrence of new-onset AF. All-cause mortality is independently associated with resting LVOT gradient at the last clinical check-up.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the 2014 ESC and the 2024 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) systems in terms of primary prevention ICD recommendations for HCM. A cohort of 200 patients with HCM in Brazil was assessed for SCD risk profile according to current guidelines. The agreement for primary prevention ICD recommendations was evaluated among different strategies. SCD and appropriate shock were defined as the end points. Among the 200 patients, 63 (31%) received a primary prevention ICD, with 10 (15.8%) receiving appropriate shocks. Low agreement was found among the guidelines (Fleiss' kappa 0.340, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.286 to 0.395, p <0.001). The European systems showed moderate agreement. The 2024 AHA/ACC algorithm placed 58% of patients in class IIa, whereas only 29% achieved this recommendation with the 2023 ESC model. The end points occurred in 8% of patients over 9.4 ± 6.5 years. The 2014 ESC guidelines had the highest accuracy (77%, 95% CI 71 to 83) and negative predictive value (96%, 95% CI 90 to 98) in detecting patients in class IIa with primary end points. However, all guidelines showed a low positive predictive value. The 2024 AHA/ACC guidelines classified the largest proportion of patients (81%) with the primary end point as class IIa.

We performed a meta-analysis of published trials assessing the effect of cardiac myosin inhibitors (mavacamten and aficamten) on resting and Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients and functional capacity in symptomatic HCM. The co-primary outcomes were mean percent change (mean difference [MD]) from baseline in LVOT gradient at rest and Valsalva LVOT gradient and the proportion of patients achieving New York Heart Association class improvement ≥1. The secondary outcomes included the mean percent change from baseline N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). A total of 4 studies (all randomized controlled trials, including 3 mavacamten-focused and 1 aficamten-focused trials) involving 463 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, the cardiac myosin inhibitor group demonstrated statistically significant differences in the baseline percent change in mean LVOT gradient at rest (MD -62.48, confidence interval [CI] -65.44 to -59.51, p <0.00001) and Valsalva LVOT gradient (MD -54.21, CI -66.05 to -42.36, p <0.00001) and the proportion of patients achieving New York Heart Association class improvement ≥1 (odds ratio 3.43, CI 1.90 to 6.20, p <0.0001). Regarding the secondary outcomes, the intervention group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean percent change from baseline in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (MD -69.41, CI -87.06 to -51.75, p <0.00001), troponin I (MD, -44.19, CI -50.59 to -37.78, p <0.00001), and LVEF (MD -6.31, CI -10.35, -2.27, p = 0.002). In conclusion, cardiac myosin inhibitors may confer clinical and symptomatic benefits in symptomatic HCM at the possible expense of LVEF. Further trials with large sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: To study clinical evolution of women with HCM during pregnancy; the influencing factors of gestation on natural course of HCM and the frequency of HCM in their children in early childhood. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 35 women with HCM; there were 23 pregnant women (PG group) and 12 nonpregnant control patients (NP group), matched for age and functional class (FC). Clinical monthly evaluations were carried out and electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiography tests were performed. The offspring endpoints included stillbirth and prematurity rates and investigation of HCM during childhood. RESULTS: No deaths occurred in either group. Cardiac arrhythmias were significantly (p< 0.05) more frequent in the NP group (33.3% vs. 13.4%), and no differences were observed between the groups (p>0.05) in heart failure (30.3% vs. 16.6%) or ischemic stroke (4.3% vs. 8.3%) rates. In the PG group, required hospitalization for treatment of cardiac complication was more frequent (p=0.05) in patients with family history of HCM (71.4% vs. 25.0%). Cesarean section was performed in 12 (52%) patients, for obstetrical reasons; there were 7 (30.4%) premature babies and 1 (4.3%) neonatal death. One child was clinically diagnosed as having HCM, and his genetic study identified a mutation in the beta myosin heavy chain gene, located on chromosome 14. CONCLUSION: Heart failure is a frequent cardiac complication in women with HCM during pregnancy, particularly in patients with family history of the disease, but this did not influence the natural course of HCM. In one child, clinical examination allowed HCM identification during early childhood.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac myosin inhibitors (CMIs), including Mavacamten and Aficamten, have emerged as a groundbreaking treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The results from phase 2 and 3 randomized clinical trials for both drugs have showed promising outcomes. However, the highly selective patient recruitment for these trials raises questions about the generalizability of the observed positive effects across broader patient populations suffering from HCM. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study at University Hospital Heidelberg included 404 HCM patients. Baseline assessments included family history, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and advanced cardiac imaging, to ensure the exclusion of secondary causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS: Among the HCM patients evaluated, only a small percentage met the inclusion criteria for recent CMI trials: 10.4% for EXPLORER-HCM and 4.7% for SEQUOIA-HCM. The predominant exclusion factor was the stringent left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient requirement. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a significant discrepancy between patient demographics in clinical trials and those encountered in routine HCM clinical practice. Despite promising results from the initial randomized clinical trials that led to the approval of Mavacamten, the selected patient population only represents a small part of the HCM patient cohort seen in routine clinics. This study advocates for further expanded randomized clinical trials with broader inclusion criteria to represent diverse primary HCM patient populations.",

The authors conducted an extensive search across multiple electronic databases, including Embase, MEDLINE (via Pubmed), and CENTRAL, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of mavacamten in HCM. Review Manager 5.4 (Revman) was employed to pool risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD). Our literature search yielded 4 RCTs with a total of 503 patients. Mavacamten was found to be associated with higher rates of greater than or equal to 1 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class improvement (RR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.48-3.28; I2=51%) and change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire- Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) (MD 7.50, 95% CI: 3.44-11.55; I2 =50%). Mavacamten was also associated with improved resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (MD -38.33, 95% CI: -49.38 to -27.28; I2 =75%), Valsalva LVOT gradient (MD -48.08, 95% CI: -62.21 to -33.96; I2 =78%), post-exercise LVOT gradient (MD -37.1, 95% CI: -44.37 to -29.84; I2 =0%), LVMI (MD -16.91, 95% CI: -28.29 to -5.54; I2 =88%), and lower rates of septal reduction therapy (SRT) (RR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22-0.40; I2 =0%). There were no significant differences between mavacamten and placebo regarding the composite functional outcome, greater than or equal to 1 treatment-emergent adverse event, greater than or equal to 1 serious adverse event, and atrial fibrillation. The authors; findings suggest that mavacamten contributes to improvements in NYHA class, KCCQ-CSS scores, and LVOT gradients while reducing the incidence of SRT in patients with HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Mavacamten, an allosteric myosin inhibitor, is considered to be a promising drug for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This meta-analysis aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of mavacamten in HCM patients. MAIN BODY: A total number of 539 patients were enrolled in four randomized clinical trials. The mean age of patients was 57.9 years and was followed for 29.3 weeks. Pooled analysis showed a significant improvement in clinical response (Log OR = 0.65; p = 0.01) and the number of patients with a reduction of ≥ 1 NYHA function class (Log OR = 0.64, p = 0.00). It was found that mavacamten did not significantly affect the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) (SMD = 0.43, p = 0.08), peak oxygen uptake (PVO2) (SMD = 0.24, p = 0.42), and ejection fraction (EF) (SMD = - 0.65, p = 0.13) as compared with placebo. However, KCCQ (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.87) and PVO2 (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.74) improvements were statically significant in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy subgroup (HOCM), and a significant decrease in EF (SMD = -- 1.14, 95% CI - 1.86 to - 0.42) was found in the HOCM subgroup. No significant difference was observed in the incidence rate of serious adverse events between mavacamten and placebo group (Log OR = - 0.23, p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Mavacamten proved to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of HCM. Mavacamten improved the signs and symptoms of HOCM and decreased EF in these patients without serious adverse events in the clinical trials.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: Severe right ventricular hypertrophy (SRVH) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is rare. We studied the clinical characteristics and prognosis of 36 patients with HCM and SRVH in a Chinese cohort. METHODS: Patients with HCM and SRVH were enrolled between 2013 and 2017. The clinical characteristics, treatment therapies, and clinical outcomes of the 36 patients were retrospectively studied and compared with those of 128 patients without SRVH. RESULTS: Patients in the group with SRVH were younger than those in the group without SRVH (27.58±15.09 years vs 40.34±13.21 years, respectively; p<0.001). Patients with SRVH had more serious clinical symptoms and a higher New York Heart Association functional class than those without SRVH. Most patients in the group with SRVH exhibited diffuse RV hypertrophy, and 13 patients presented with biventricular outflow tract obstruction. Maximal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (27.29±7.95 mm vs 24.33±5.85 mm, respectively; p=0.027) and LV outflow tract gradient (80.83±24.41 mm Hg vs 42.3±5.7 mm Hg, respectively; p=0.000) were significantly greater in patients with SRVH than in those without SRVH. A total of 30 patients in the group with SRVH underwent surgical correction. During a median follow-up period of 48 months, six patients with SRVH reached primary clinical endpoints (four sudden cardiac deaths, one heart failure-related death, and one heart transplantation), whereas only two deaths occurred in the patients without SRVH. CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with HCM and SRVH exhibit serious symptoms and have complex surgical requirements and poor clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: Characterization of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and the effects of myectomy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remain poorly defined. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of myectomy on PH in HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective analysis of 306 consecutive symptomatic HCM patients (70% NYHA class III-IV) with evaluation of echocardiographic right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) both preceding (median 3 days) and following (median 4 days) myectomy. Compared with patients without PH (RVSP <35 mmHg, n = 145, 47%), patients with moderate or severe PH (RVSP ≥50 mmHg, n = 51, 17%) were older, predominantly female, had a greater prevalence of atrial fibrillation, higher natriuretic peptide levels, higher left ventricular outflow tract gradient, higher E velocity, and larger left atria. Reduction of RVSP post-myectomy was evident in patients with moderate or severe PH [59 (IQR 54-71) to 50 (IQR 39-62) mmHg, P < 0.0001] and in all patients with PH [RVSP ≥ 35 mmHg, n = 161, 43 (IQR 39-54) to 41 (IQR 35-52) mmHg, P < 0.0001]. In a subgroup of patients with long-term data, PH continued to decline during follow-up. Clinical variables associated with improvement in PH in these patients were higher left atrial volume index (R = 0.43, P = 0.0069) and moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (R = 0.33, P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Surgical myectomy is associated with improvement in PH, most pronounced in moderate or severe PH. These data provide insight into pulmonary haemodynamics following obstruction relief and can help to guide therapeutic expectations.",

MAVA-LTE (NCT03723655) is an ongoing, 5-year, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term effects of mavacamten. METHODS: Participants from EXPLORER-HCM (NCT03470545) could enrol in MAVA-LTE upon study completion. RESULTS: At the latest data cut-off, 211 (91.3%) of the 231 patients originally enrolled in MAVA-LTE still received mavacamten. Median (range) time on study was 166.1 (6.0-228.1) weeks; 185 (80.1%) and 99 (42.9%) patients had completed the Week 156 and 180 visits, respectively. Sustained reductions from baseline to Week 180 occurred in left ventricular outflow tract gradients [mean (standard deviation): resting, -40.3 (32.7) mmHg; Valsalva, -55.3 (33.7) mmHg], N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide [median (interquartile range): -562 (-1162.5, -209) ng/L], and EQ-5D-5L score [mean (standard deviation): 0.09 (0.17)]. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from 73.9% (baseline) to 66.6% (Week 24) and 63.9% (Week 180). At Week 180, 74 (77.9%) of the 95 patients improved by at least one New York Heart Association class from baseline. Over 739 patient-years exposure, 20 patients (8.7%; exposure-adjusted incidence: 2.77/100 patient-years) experienced 22 transient reductions in LVEF to <50% resulting in temporary treatment interruption (all recovered LVEF of ≥50%). Five (2.2%) patients died (all considered unrelated to mavacamten). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term mavacamten treatment resulted in sustained improvements in cardiac function and symptoms in patients with obstructive HCM, with no new safety concerns identified. Transient, reversible reductions in LVEF were observed in a small proportion of patients during long-term follow-up.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (nHCM) often experience a high burden of symptoms; however, there are no proven pharmacological therapies. By altering the contractile mechanics of the cardiomyocyte, myosin inhibitors have the potential to modify pathophysiology and improve symptoms associated with HCM. OBJECTIVES: MAVERICK-HCM (Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Non-Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) explored the safety and efficacy of mavacamten, a first-in-class reversible inhibitor of cardiac-specific myosin, in nHCM. METHODS: The MAVERICK-HCM trial was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase II study in adults with symptomatic nHCM (New York Heart Association functional class II/III), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥55%, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥300 pg/ml. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to mavacamten at a pharmacokinetic-adjusted dose (targeting plasma levels of 200 or 500 ng/ml), or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by an 8-week washout. Initial dose was 5 mg daily with 1 dose titration at week 6. RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants were randomized (19, 21, 19 patients to 200 ng/ml, 500 ng/ml, placebo, respectively). Their mean age was 54 years, and 58% were women. Serious adverse events occurred in 10% of participants on mavacamten and in 21% participants on placebo. Five participants on mavacamten had reversible reduction in LVEF ≤45%. NT-proBNP geometric mean decreased by 53% in the pooled mavacamten group versus 1% in the placebo group, with geometric mean differences of -435 and -6 pg/ml, respectively (p = 0.0005). Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) geometric mean decreased by 34% in the pooled mavacamten group versus a 4% increase in the placebo group, with geometric mean differences of -0.008 and 0.001 ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Mavacamten, a novel myosin inhibitor, was well tolerated in most subjects with symptomatic nHCM. Furthermore, treatment was associated with a significant reduction in NT-proBNP and cTnI, suggesting improvement in myocardial wall stress. These results set the stage for future studies of mavacamten in this patient population using clinical parameters, including LVEF, to guide dosing.

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Midventricular obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is less common than subaortic obstruction, and there are few data on outcomes after surgical treatment. METHODS: We reviewed 56 consecutive patients (28 men) with HCM and midventricular obstruction who underwent myectomy between February 1997 and June 2012. Five patients had prior myectomy for subaortic obstruction. Mean age was 42 ± 17 years. Preoperatively, 51% of patients had dyspnea, and the remaining had palpitations (25%), angina (5%), or syncope (9%). RESULTS: Midventricular obstruction was relieved by means of a transaortic myectomy in 5 patients, a transapical approach in 32 patients, and combined transaortic and transapical incisions in 19 patients. In 13 patients, an apical aneurysm or pouch was repaired at the time of midventricular myectomy. There were no early deaths. Intraoperative intraventricular gradients were reduced from 64 ± 32 mm Hg before myectomy to 6 ± 12 mm Hg postoperatively (p ≤ 0.0001). Early complications included atrial arrhythmias in 5 patients and reoperation for bleeding in 4 patients. Fifty patients had follow-up beyond 30 days (median, 1.6 years; range, 33 days to 13 years). Survival at 1 and 5 years was 100% and 95%, and average New York Heart Association class improved from 2.9 ± 0.7 preoperatively to 1.3 ± 0.6 postoperatively (p = 0.0001). There were no aneurysms related to the apical incision; 2 patients had late reoperation, 1 for resection of right atrial mass to prevent embolus. CONCLUSIONS: A transapical approach allows excellent exposure for midventricular myectomy and relief of intraventricular gradients and related symptoms. There were no complications unique to the apical incision, and 5-year survival was similar to expected survival (95% versus 97%).",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The benefit-risk profile of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) therapy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been well established yet. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DOAC compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with HCM and AF. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched to identify studies comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with HCM and AF. The primary endpoint was thromboembolic events. The relative risks and standard errors were pooled by random-effect models using the generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Seven observational studies involving 9395 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to the VKA group, the DOAC group displayed a similar risk of thromboembolic events [RR (95%CI): 0.93 (0.73-1.20), p = 0.59] and ischemic stroke [RR (95%CI): 0.65 (0.33-1.28), p = 0.22]. The incidence of major bleeding was comparable between the two groups [RR (95%CI): 0.75 (0.49-1.15), p = 0.19]. Meanwhile, DOAC therapy was superior to VKA therapy in reducing the incidences of all-cause death [RR (95%CI): 0.44 (0.35-0.55), p < 0.001], cardiovascular death [RR (95%CI): 0.41 (0.22-0.75), p = 0.004], and intracranial hemorrhage [RR (95%CI): 0.42 (0.24-0.74), p = 0.003]. CONCLUSION: In patients with HCM and AF, DOAC therapy was similar to VKA therapy in reducing the risk of thromboembolic events, without increasing bleeding risk. In addition, the DOAC group displayed significant advantages in reducing mortality and intracranial hemorrhage compared with the VKA group. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more evidence for DOAC therapy in this population.",

        "Abstract Note": "The management of concomitant mitral valve (MV) disease in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains controversial. The 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology HCM guidelines recommend that MV replacement (MVR) at the time of myectomy should not be performed for the sole purpose of relieving outflow obstruction. At the national level, limited data exist on the surgical outcomes of MV repair/replacement in patients with HCM who underwent septal myectomy (SM). Hospitalizations of patients with HCM who underwent SM between 2005 and 2020 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System). The 3 comparison cohorts were SM alone, MV repair, and MVR with concomitant SM. After propensity matching, 2 cohorts, SM + MVR versus SM + MV repair, were studied for surgical outcomes. Demographic characteristics, baseline co-morbidities, procedural complications, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and cost of hospitalization were compared between the propensity-matched cohorts. A total of 16,797 SM procedures were identified from 2005 to 2020. Among them, 11,470 hospitalizations had SM alone (68.2%), SM + MVR was seen in 3,101 (18.4%), and SM + MV repair comprised 2,226 (13.2%). After propensity matching, the MVR and MV repair formed the matched cohorts of 1,857. There were no significant differences in the odds of cardiogenic shock (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 1.24, p = 0.49), mechanical circulatory support requirement (aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.90, p = 0.015), stroke (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.99, p = 0.29), and major bleeding (aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.79, p = 0.0026) between the comparison groups. MVR, compared with MV repair, was associated with a higher risk of procedural mortality (8.02% vs 3.18%, aOR 2.98, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.33, p <0.0001), complete heart block (16.36% vs 12.15%, aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.12, p <0.0001), and the need for permanent pacemaker (16.39% vs 10.62%, aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.38, p <0.0001). The total length of hospital stay and median hospitalization cost was higher in the MVR group. SM in HCM concomitant with MVR is associated with higher procedural mortality and in-hospital complication risk. These real-world data support the 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines that in patients who are candidates for surgical myectomy, MVR should not be performed as part of the operative strategy for relieving outflow obstruction in HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects millions of individuals worldwide. In severe cases, it can cause life-threatening conditions such as left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, mitral regurgitation (MR), and sudden cardiac death, making surgical treatment necessary. This study aimed to report the long-term outcomes of HCM patients undergoing septal myectomy or mitral valve replacement (MVR) and compare the results between different types of surgeries. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study on HCM patients who underwent surgical treatment in an Iranian referral center between 2005 and 2021. Patients were divided into three groups according to the type of surgery received: septal myectomy, MVR, or a combination of both surgeries. Patient characteristics, surgical and echocardiographic features, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes were reported and compared between the three groups. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients with an average age of 53.3 ± 16.9 were included. Twenty-six patients had septal myectomy, 23 had MVR, and 53 had combined septal myectomy and MVR surgery. All surgeries were associated with a significant reduction in interventricular septum thickness and LVOT gradients. After a median of 6.8-year follow-up time, patients with an isolated septal myectomy had significantly lower mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rates than the other groups. CONCLUSION: Isolated septal myectomy showed better long-term survival rates and can correct HCM-related MR, while MVR should be preserved only for intrinsic valve defects. More extensive studies are needed to confirm these findings and achieve a comprehensive guideline on surgical treatment of HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "Recent studies indicate that reversible 201Tl perfusion defects, compatible with silent myocardial ischemia, commonly develop during exercise in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To determine whether this represents a dynamic process that may be modified favorably by medical therapy, we studied 29 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with HCM, aged 12-55 years (mean, 28), with exercise 201Tl emission computed tomography under control conditions and again after 1 week of oral verapamil (mean dosage, 453 mg/day). Treadmill time increased slightly during verapamil (21.0 +/- 3.6 to 21.9 +/- 2.7 minutes, p less than 0.005), but peak heart rate-blood pressure product was unchanged (26.3 +/- 6.0 X 10(3) compared with 25.0 +/- 6.4 X 10(3). Two midventricular short-axis images per study were divided into five regions each, and each of these 10 regions was then analyzed on a 0-2 scale by three observers blinded with regard to the patients' therapy. Average regional scores of 1.5 or less were considered to represent perfusion defects, and a change in regional score of 0.5 or more was considered to constitute a significant change. During control studies, 15 patients (52%) developed perfusion defects with exercise (average, 3.7 regions per patient). In 14 of these patients, all perfusion defects completely reversed after 3 hours of rest; one patient had fixed defects. After administration of verapamil, exercise perfusion scores improved in 10 of the 14 patients (71%) with reversible defects; there was overall improvement in 34 of 50 (68%) regions with initially reversible perfusion defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Few therapeutic options exist for patients with severe heart failure due to obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who are at unacceptable surgical risk. We hypothesized that percutaneous plication of the mitral valve could reduce left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and associated mitral regurgitation, thereby leading to amelioration of heart failure symptoms. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the potential effectiveness of percutaneous mitral valve plication as a therapy for patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM. METHODS: Six patients (age 83 ± 8 years; 5 women), judged as not optimal candidates for septal myectomy, were referred for management of severe, drug-refractory heart failure symptoms due to obstructive HCM (New York Heart Association functional class III). Each underwent percutaneous mitral valve leaflet plication to reduce systolic anterior motion (SAM) and mitral regurgitation using the transcatheter mitral clip system. RESULTS: The procedure was completed in 5 patients with placement of a single clip at the A2-P2 segments of the mitral valve. One other patient experienced cardiac tamponade, leading to termination of the procedure. Among the 5 treated patients, percutaneous plication with the eliminated SAM and consequently decreased the intraoperative LVOT gradient (91 ± 44 mm Hg to 12 ± 6 mm Hg; p = 0.007), left atrial pressure (29 ± 11 mm Hg to 20 ± 8 mm Hg; p = 0.06), and mitral regurgitation grade (3.0 ± 0 vs. 0.8 ± 0.4; p = 0.0002) associated with improved cardiac output (in n = 4; 3.0 ± 0.6 l/min to 4.3 ± 1.2 l/min; p = 0.03). Over follow-up of 15 ± 4 months, symptom improvement to New York Heart Association functional class I or II occurred in all patients. Follow-up echocardiography after 15 ± 4 months demonstrated continued absence of SAM and significant reduction in mitral regurgitation, although high systolic LVOT velocities (i.e., >4 m/s) were evident in 3 of the 5 treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is a report of percutaneous mitral valve plication as a primary therapy in the management of severely symptomatic, obstructive HCM patients. This initial experience suggests that percutaneous mitral valve plication may be effective for symptom relief in such patients via reduction of SAM and mitral regurgitation. The significance of persistent elevations of LVOT velocities in some patients requires further study.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The left ventricular (LV) posterior wall thickness (PWT) is a predictor of sudden cardiac death in pediatric patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but the prognostic importance of PWT in adults has not been examined. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the association of LV PWT with late survival in adult patients undergoing septal myectomy for obstructive HCM. METHODS: This single-center study reviewed 2,418 patients who underwent transaortic septal myectomy for obstructive HCM. RESULTS: The median preoperative PWT was 13 (IQR: 11-15) mm. Patients with PWT >13 mm tended to have systemic hypertension (55.4% vs 49.1%; P = 0.002) and a larger body mass index (median: 30.8 [IQR: 27.1-35.1] kg/m2 vs 29.6 [IQR: 26.1-33.9] kg/m2; P < 0.001). Preoperatively, PWT >13 mm was associated with increased septal thickness (median: 21 [IQR: 18-24] mm vs 19 [IQR: 17-22] mm; P < 0.001), greater maximum instantaneous left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient at rest (median: 67 [IQR: 36-96] mm Hg vs 47 [IQR: 19-79] mm Hg), and increased likelihood of moderate or greater mitral valve regurgitation (54.3% vs 47.3%; P = 0.001). However, PWT was not related to the severity of limitations measured by New York Heart Association functional class (P = 0.674). After adjusting for baseline covariates, greater PWT was an independent risk factor for late mortality after septal myectomy (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PWT is a newly identified predictor of reduced long-term survival after septal myectomy that is independent of septal thickness and severity of LVOT gradient. Future studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms underlying the association and the potential usefulness of PWT in patient management.",

        "Abstract Note": "AIMS: In patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and mild septal thickness undergoing myectomy, resecting fibrotic anterior mitral leaflet (AML) secondary chordae moves the mitral valve (MV) away from the outflow tract and ejection flow, reducing the need for a deep septal excision. Aim of the present study was to assess whether chordal resection has similarly favourable effects in patients with important hypertrophy, who represent the majority of patients with obstructive HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MV position in the ventricular cavity, assessed from echocardiography as AML-annulus ratio, was compared before and after chordal resection in 150 consecutive HCM patients with important (≥20 mm) and 62 with mild (≤19 mm) septal thickness undergoing myectomy. Preoperatively, MV position was displaced towards the septum to a similar extent in both groups. Postoperatively, AML-annulus ratio increased of an equal degree in both groups, from 0.43 ± 0.05 to 0.55 ± 0.06 (P < 0.001) a 28% increase, and from 0.43 ± 0.06 to 0.55 ± 0.06 (P < 0.001) a 26% increase, respectively, indicating a similar MV shift away from the outflow tract. When AML-annulus ratio was compared in the study cohort and 124 normal subjects, MV position was within normal range in <4% of patients preoperatively and normalized in >50% postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: In obstructive HCM, displacement of the MV apparatus into the outflow tract interferes with the ejection flow. Resection of fibrotic secondary chordae moves the MV apparatus away from the outflow tract and enlarges the outflow area independently of septal thickness, facilitating septal myectomy by reducing the need for a deep muscular excision.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the utility of long-term arrhythmia monitoring with an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) after ASA. METHODS: Between February 2014 and March 2019, 56 patients with HCM undergoing ASA were enrolled in a prospective study and underwent ICM implantation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the rate of ICM-detected arrhythmic events. RESULTS: The mean age was 59 ± 11 years, and 20 (36%) were women. The median (25th, 75th percentile) resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient obtained by echocardiography was 43 (22, 81) mm Hg. Greater than 1 septal perforating artery was injected in 48 patients (86%). The Kaplan-Meier cumulative rate of ICM-detected arrhythmic events at 18 months of follow-up was 71%, with an event rate of 43% occurring within 3 months of ASA. The cumulative rate of the ICM-detected first atrial fibrillation event at 18 months was 37%, and the corresponding rate of CHB was 19%. All atrial fibrillation and CHB events were actionable, leading to the initiation of anticoagulation and pacemaker implantation, respectively. No baseline demographic or procedural variables were identified as independent predictors of an increased risk of developing ICM-detected arrhythmic events. CONCLUSION: After ASA, ICM is effective in capturing clinically actionable arrhythmic events in patients with HCM regardless of patient's baseline risk factors.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that women with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM) have worse long-term outcomes irrespective of intervention. However, the outcomes of patients undergoing alcohol septal ablation (ASA) based on sex have not been described. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate pressure changes and long-term mortality in patients with HCM undergoing ASA based on sex. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a single-center retrospective study evaluating hemodynamic changes and long-term mortality in patients with HCM treated with ASA according to sex. A total of 259 patients were included (aged 68.4±11.9 years, 62.2% women). Women had higher age and baseline pressures at the time of ASA, with a greater percent reduction in mean left atrial pressure (men versus women: 2.2% versus 15.9%, respectively; P=0.02). Women had better survival (median survival rate of men versus women: 8.6 versus 12.5 years, respectively; P=0.011). On Cox multivariable regression, predictors of mortality were age (per group change <60 years, 61-70 years, 71-80 years, and >80 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.45 [95% CI, 1.10-1.91], P=0.008), female sex (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.35-0.99], P=0.048), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.06-3.33], P=0.031), and left ventricular outflow tract gradient reduction ≤86% (HR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.14-3.19], P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Women with HCM undergoing ASA are older and have higher left-sided baseline pressures compared with men yet have better survival. Further studies exploring the mechanisms of differential outcomes according to sex in patients with HCM undergoing ASA are needed.",

        "Abstract Note": "Limited data are available on the long-term outcomes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) requiring revascularization. We investigated the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in HCM patients who underwent coronary revascularization compared to the control group without HCM. HCM patients aged ≥ 20 years were enrolled from the Korean National Health Insurance Database. Information on the diagnosis and previous medical history was obtained from the claims data. Cardiovascular outcomes were identified during 8-year after coronary revascularization in HCM patients (HCM group) and matched controls without HCM (non-HCM control group). A total of 431 patients in the HCM group and 1968 in the non-HCM control group were analyzed. The risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death (SCD), ischemic stroke, and hospitalization due to heart failure was significantly higher in the HCM group than in the non-HCM group, with prominent risk increase of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.63-3.15, P < 0.001) and ischemic stroke (adjusted HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.55-3.64, P < 0.001). Beyond 1-year after revascularization, the HCM group still had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death, SCD, and ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia compared to the non-HCM group. Mortality and major cardiovascular outcomes occurred more frequently in HCM patients with significant CAD requiring revascularization, compared to the matched non-HCM control group. Active and regular surveillance for concomitant risk factors and relevant intervention are warranted in HCM patients at increased risk for CAD.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Many prefer mitral valve replacement (MVR) for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and concomitant degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR). We reviewed our results of septal myectomy combined with mitral valve repair (MVrep) and MVR when these problems coexist. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2006, 32 patients (56% men; mean age, 60.7 +/- 16.7 years) underwent extended septal myectomy for HCM with concomitant MVrep or MVR for degenerative MR (4% of myectomies and 3% of isolated MVrep during the same period). Preoperatively, 63% were in New York Heart Association (NHYA) functional class III/IV. Preoperative peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient was 63.7 +/- 37.6 mm Hg. Systolic anterior motion (SAM) was present in 94%, with severe MR in 88%. RESULTS: Extended septal myectomy included concomitant MVrep in 28 (88%) or mechanical MVR in 4 (12%). MVrep included leaflet resection in 10 (36%), edge-to-edge stitch in 6 (21%), and leaflet plication in 8 (29%). An annuloplasty ring/band was used in 19 (68%) and commissural annuloplasty in 2 (7%). There was one early death (3%). At discharge, resting LVOT gradient was reduced to 10.2 +/- 19.0 mm Hg (p < 0.005). Dismissal echocardiography in MVrep patients demonstrated chordal SAM in 6 (21%, p < 0.005). MR was absent or mild in 21 (75%) and moderate in 6 (21%; p < 0.005 vs preoperatively). At late follow-up, LVOT gradient was 2.5 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, SAM resolved in all patients, and 2 had moderate MR; 24 (83%) were in NYHA class I/II (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant MVrep with myectomy for HCM and degenerative MR can be performed with low early mortality with satisfactory relief of LVOT obstruction and MR. Most patients have significant relief of symptoms. MVR can be avoided in most patients with degenerative MR and HCM.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) causes exertional symptoms in two thirds of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Consensus guidelines recommend surgical intervention in patients with drug refractory symptoms. The primary aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine morbidity and mortality after surgery. METHODS: Study Selection: Studies reporting outcomes following surgical intervention for symptomatic LVOTO in HCM. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles from searching two scientific databases (PubMed and Web of Science) were reviewed and data were extracted by two investigators. Meta-analysis of data was performed with heterogeneity assessed using I2 statistic. RESULTS: 85 studies were included in the systematic review and 35 studies in the meta-analysis. Contemporary early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) mortality following septal myectomy were 1.4% (CI 0.8, 2.4) I2 9.0%, p = 0.36 and 0.7% (CI 0.3, 1.2) I2 70.7%, p < 0.05 respectively. Sixty-eight studies (80%) reported perioperative complications. The contemporary rate of a perioperative ventricular septal defect was 1.4% (0.8, 2.3) I2 0%, p < 0.05. Late morbidities including atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure and transplant were reported in fewer than 22% of studies and few studies compared mortality and clinical outcomes using different surgical approaches to LVOTO. The incidence rate (IR) of reintervention with a further surgical procedure was 0.3% (CI 0.2, 0.4) I2 52.5%, p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary surgical management of LVOTO is associated with low operative mortality rates but further studies are needed to investigate the impact of surgical therapy on non-fatal early and late complications.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may have symptoms mimicking ischemic heart disease, including chest pain and shortness of breath. Some patients undergo coronary revascularization which may not lead to symptomatic improvement. This study assesses clinical presentations and outcomes of patients with previous coronary revascularization undergoing septal myectomy. METHOD: From 08/1996 to 07/2017, 166 adult patients with obstructive HCM underwent septal myectomy at our Clinic with a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, N = 153) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, N = 13). We assessed their functional status before and after coronary intervention and outcomes following myectomy. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age was 65 (59-71) years, and 106 (64%) were male. Among 150 patients whose extent of disease was known, single vessel disease was identified in 109 (73%) who had PCI and 1 (9%) who had CABG. Following revascularization, many (59%) reported no improvement in shortness of breath from preoperative status. Myectomy was performed at a median of 3.2 (1.0-6.3) years following coronary revascularization, and 40 (25%) required myectomy within 1 year. Patients whose shortness of breath persisted after PCI/CABG (N = 90) underwent myectomy earlier than those whose symptoms initially improved (N = 63) after coronary revascularization (1.4 [0.6-4.0] years vs. 5.1 [2.8-9.5] years, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Almost 25% of patient's required septal myectomy within 1 year of coronary intervention for continued symptoms originally thought to be due to ischemic heart disease. These findings highlight the overlap of obstruction and ischemic symptoms and the importance of complete evaluation for dynamic obstruction in HCM.",

        "DOI": "10.1002/ehf2.12267",
        "Abstract Note": "The relevance of gene mutations leading to heart diseases and hence heart failure has become evident. The risk for and the course of heart failure depends on genomic variants and mutations underlying the so-called genetic predisposition. Genetic contribution to heart failure is highly heterogenous and complex. For any patient with a likely inherited heart failure syndrome, genetic counselling is recommended and important. In the last few years, novel sequencing technologies (named next-generation sequencing - NGS) have dramatically improved the availability of molecular testing, the efficiency of genetic analyses, and moreover reduced the cost for genetic testing. Due to this development, genetic testing has become increasingly accessible and NGS-based sequencing is now applied in clinical routine diagnostics. One of the most common reasons of heart failure are cardiomyopathies such as the dilated or the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nearly 100 disease-associated genes have been identified for cardiomyopathies. The knowledge of a pathogenic mutation can be used for genetic counselling, risk and prognosis determination, therapy guidance and hence for a more effective treatment. Besides, family cascade screening for a known familial, pathogenic mutation can lead to an early diagnosis in affected individuals. At that timepoint, a preventative intervention could be used to avoid or delay disease onset or delay disease progression. Understanding the cellular basis of genetic heart failure syndromes in more detail may provide new insights into the molecular biology of physiological and impaired cardiac (cell) function. As our understanding of the molecular and genetic pathophysiology of heart failure will increase, this might help to identify novel therapeutic targets and may lead to the development of new and specific treatment options in patients with heart failure.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: The genetic background of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) treated with alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and its relationship to the outcomes are not known. We aimed to investigate whether the outcome of genotype positive (G+) patients differs from genotype negative (G-) patients treated with ASA. METHODS: We included 129 HCM patients (mean age 54±13 years) treated with ASA in a tertiary cardiovascular center and performed next generation sequencing (NGS) based genomic testing. All patients were followed-up three months after the procedure and yearly thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 30 (23%) HCM patients were G+ patients. At the 3-months follow-up, both groups of patients had similar left ventricular outflow tract PG (16.9±15.7 mmHg in G+ vs. 16.3±18.8 mmHg in G-, P=0.73) and symptoms (follow-up NYHA class 1.40±0.62 vs. 1.37±0.53, P=0.99, follow-up CCS class 0.23±0.52 vs. 0.36±0.65, P=0.36). The independent predictors of all-cause mortality were baseline interventricular septum (IVS) thickness (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.26, P=0.049) and age at the time of ASA (HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17, P<0.01). The adjusted all-cause mortality rate did not differ significantly between G+ and G- patients (P=0.52). The adjusted combined mortality event rate did not differ between both groups (P=0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Despite more severe phenotype in G+ HCM patients, ASA is an equally effective treatment for LVOTO in G+ patients as it is for treating LVOTO in G- patients. The long-term outcome after ASA is similar in G+ and G- patients.",

        "Abstract Note": "Septal myectomy is indicated in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and intractable symptoms. Concomitant mitral valve (MV) surgery is performed for abnormalities contributing to systolic anterior motion (SAM), or for SAM-mediated mitral regurgitation (MR) with or without left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. One MV repair technique is anterior mitral leaflet extension (AMLE) utilizing bovine pericardium, stiffening the leaflet and enhancing coaptation posteriorly. Fifteen HCM patients who underwent combined myectomy-AMLE for LVOT obstruction or moderate-to-severe MR between 2009 and 2020 were analyzed using detailed echocardiography. The mean age was 56.6 years and 67% were female. The average peak systolic LVOT gradient and MR grade measured 73.4 mmHg and 2.3, respectively. Indications for myectomy-AMLE were LVOT obstruction and moderate-to-severe MR in 67%, MR only in 20%, and LVOT obstruction only in 13%. There was no mortality observed, and median follow-up was 1.2 years. Two patients had follow-up grade 1 mitral SAM, one of whom also had mild LVOT obstruction. No recurrent MR was observed in 93%, and mild MR in 7%. Compared with preoperative measures, there was a decrease in follow-up LV ejection fraction (68.2 vs 56.3%, p = 0.02) and maximal septal wall thickness (25.5 vs 21.3 mm, p < 0.001), and an increase in the end-diastolic diameter (21.9 vs 24.8 mm/m2, p = 0.04). There was no change in global longitudinal strain (-12.1 vs -11.6%, p = 0.73) and peak LV twist (7.4 vs 7.3°, p = 0.97). In conclusion, myectomy-AMLE is a viable treatment option for carefully selected symptomatic HCM patients with LVOT obstruction or moderate-to-severe MR.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has been shown to have low efficacy for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We conducted this study to evaluate the benefit of adjunctive vein of Marshall (VOM) ethanol infusion during RFCA for persistent AF (PsAF) in patients with non-obstructive HCM. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective observational study included 102 consecutive non-obstructive HCM patients with PsAF who underwent RFCA plus VOM ethanol infusion (VOM-EI) (RFCA + VOM, n = 56) or RFCA alone (RFCA, n = 46) for the first time. The efficacy endpoint was survival without AF or atrial tachycardia (AT) after the blanking period. RESULTS: We completed the VOM-EI in 92.9% (52/56) patients. The left pulmonary vein antrum ablation time (RFCA + VOM: 19.9 ± 6.1 min vs. RFCA: 27.2 ± 9.3 min), mitral isthmus (MI) ablation time (RFCA + VOM: 16.9 ± 3.7 min vs. RFCA: 28.4 ± 7.8 min), and rate of coronary sinus (CS) vein ablation (RFCA + VOM: 57.69% vs. RFCA: 80.43%) were lower but the acute success rate of MI block (RFCA + VOM: 98.1% vs. RFCA: 84.8%) were higher in the RFCA + VOM group than those in the RFCA group (all p < 0.05). After twelve months follow-up, 84.6% of patients (44/52) survived without AF/AT in the RFCA + VOM group, compared to 65.2% of patients (30/46) in the RFCA group (p = 0.03; odds ratio = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.18-7.79). CONCLUSIONS: VOM-EI combined with RFCA decreased the recurrence rate of AF/AT at 12 months in HCM patients with PsAF. VOM-EI simplified the ablation of the left pulmonary vein antrum and MI and increased the success rate of MI bidirectional block.",

We therefore sought to investigate the relation between infarct location versus infarct size with outcome after ASA in patients with obstructive HCM. Baseline characteristics, procedural characteristics, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance findings at baseline and 4-6 month follow-up after ASA were analysed in 47 patients with obstructive HCM in a single-center retrospective study. Infarct size was determined using late gadolinium enhancement. Infarct location was divided into \"basal infarction\" and \"distal infarction\" based on an optimal cut-of value of the distance from the basal septum to the beginning of the infarction. A \"successful\" outcome was defined as 80% reduction of the invasive gradient with a post-procedural gradient of <10 mmHg. Basal infarctions (n = 31) compared to distal infarctions (n = 16) were associated with successful outcome (100 vs. 38%, P < 0.001). Larger infarct size (n = 20) compared to smaller infarct size (n = 27) was not associated with successful outcome (75 vs. 82%, P = 0.72). A more distal location of the infarction, was the only predictor of a less successful outcome (odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.98, P = 0.03). Basal versus distal infarctions were also associated with a lower provoked gradient at late (2.6 ± 2.2 years) follow-up (11 (6-20) vs. 27 (12-94) mmHg, P = 0.01). Basal infarctions were associated with a successful outcome after ASA. A larger infarct size was not associated with a better outcome.",

        "Abstract Note": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as myocardial hypertrophy in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease capable of producing the magnitude of present hypertrophy. In about 70% of patients with HCM, there is left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (LVOTO) and this is known as obstructive type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Cases refractory to medical treatment have had two options either surgical septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation (ASA) to alleviate LVOT gradient. ASA may cause some life-threatening complications including conduction disturbances and complete heart block, hemodynamic compromise, ventricular arrhythmias, distant and massive myocardial necrosis. Glue septal ablation (GSA) is a promising technique for the treatment of HOCM. Glue seems to be superior to alcohol due to some intrinsic advantageous properties of glue such as immediate polymerization which prevents the leak into the left anterior descending coronary artery and it is particularly useful in patients with collaterals to the right coronary artery in whom alcohol ablation is contraindicated. In our experience, GSA is effective and also a safe technique without significant complications. GSA decreases LVOT gradient immediately after the procedure and this reduction persists during 12 months of follow-up. It improves New York Heart Association functional capacity and decrease interventricular septal wall thickness. Further studies are needed in order to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of this technique.",

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with latent LVOT obstruction who underwent septal myectomy. METHODS: We studied 34 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and latent LVOT obstruction who underwent septal myectomy in 2011-2019 at Anzhen Hospital. After 2:1 propensity score matching, the study cohort included 34 patients with latent LVOT obstruction and 68 patients with resting LVOT obstruction. RESULTS: Compared to patients with resting LVOT obstruction, patients with latent LVOT obstruction had a thinner interventricular septal thickness (18.2 ± 3.2 mm vs. 20.4 ± 5.6 mm; p = .01), while the proportion of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was significantly higher (26.5% vs. 5.9%; p = .003). Moreover, the proportion of mitral valve procedures (26.5% vs. 5.9%; p = .004) was significantly higher in patients with latent LVOT obstruction. However, there was no intergroup difference in cardiovascular death (5.9% vs. 1.5%, p = .26). Furthermore, the 5-year survival rates after sudden cardiac death (100.0% vs. 91.7%; p = .26) and cardiovascular death (95.5% vs. 89.0%; p = .32) were similar between HCM patients with latent versus resting LVOT obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Midterm clinical outcomes were similar and excellent in a matched cohort of HCM patients with latent versus resting LVOT obstruction after septal myectomy.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the risk factors of in-hospital postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) and the impact of POAF on the clinical outcome in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients who underwent myectomy. METHODS: Data from a total of 494 obstructive HCM patients, who had undergone preoperative cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) testing and who underwent myectomy at Fuwai Hospital from June 2011 to June 2016, were collected. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that old age (odds ratio [OR], 4.326; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.248-8.325; p <0.001), maximal left atrium volume (LAV) (OR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.075-1.202; p <0.001), and hypertension (OR, 2.754; 95% CI, 1.262-6.007; p = 0.011) were associated with the incidence of POAF. In the patients without preoperative AF, Cox regression analysis demonstrated that POAF (p = 0.002), decreased left atrium (LA) ejection fraction (LAEF) (p = 0.036), concomitant procedure (p = 0.039), and postoperative residual moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation (p = 0.030) were independent predictors of composite cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: POAF indicated a poorer clinical outcome after myectomy for obstructive HCM patients, which was similar to those with preoperative AF. Elevated LAV was independently related to POAF onset in HCM patients who underwent myectomy.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate atrial fibrillation incidence following ASA. METHODS: We studied 132 consecutive HCM patients without comorbid AF that underwent 154 ASA procedures. The incidence of AF in follow-up was assessed through chart abstraction including electrocardiography. Survival free of AF was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 3.6 ± 2.7 years (maximum 11.3 years), 10 (7.6%) patients developed new-onset AF. Of those who developed AF, both resting and provoked left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients had improved significantly (difference -79.78 mm Hg, P ≤ 0.005). Severity of mitral regurgitation improved in 7 (70%) patients. Survival free of AF was estimated to be 99.1%, 93.7%, and 91.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relieving LVOT obstruction and improving mitral regurgitation severity via ASA, new-onset AF remained a common complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by a thickened, fibrotic myocardium, remains the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. Based on animal and clinical data, we hypothesized that atorvastatin would induce left ventricular (LV) mass regression. METHODS: Statin Induced Regression of Cardiomyopathy Trial (SIRCAT) was a randomized, placebo-controlled study. The primary endpoint was change in LV mass measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 12 months after treatment with once-daily atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo. A key secondary endpoint was diastolic dysfunction measured echocardiographically by transmitral flow velocities. SIRCAT is registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00317967). RESULTS: Of 222 screened patients, 22 were randomized evenly to atorvastatin and placebo. The mean age was 47 ± 10 years, and 15 (68%) were male. All subjects completed the protocol. At baseline, LV masses were 197 ± 76 g and 205 ± 82 g in the placebo and atorvastatin groups, respectively. After 12 months treatment, the LV masses in the placebo and atorvastatin groups were 196 ± 80 versus 206 ± 92 g (P = 0.80), respectively. Echocardiographic indices were not different in the two groups at baseline. After 12 months, diastolic dysfunction as assessed using transmitral flow velocities E/E', A/A', and peak systolic mitral velocity showed no benefit from atorvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, atorvastatin did not cause LV mass regression or improvements in LV diastolic function.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: People diagnosed with genetic heart diseases (GHDs) associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) have historically been restricted from competitive sports. Recent data documenting return-to-play (RTP) experiences following shared decision making (SDM) suggest that cardiac event rates for athletes with a GHD are lower than previously described, thereby suggesting an opportunity to reconsider this paradigm. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes among National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I university and professional athletes diagnosed with a GHD. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis was performed to examine demographics, clinical characteristics, RTP outcomes, and cardiac events among elite athletes with a GHD. RESULTS: A total of 76 elite (66%, Division I, 34% professional) athletes (age 19.9 ± 5 years, 28% women) diagnosed with a GHD (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [53%], long QT syndrome, long QT syndrome [26%]) comprise this cohort. Most athletes were asymptomatic (48 of 76, 63%) before diagnosis and had their GHD detected during routine preparticipation cardiovascular screening. Most athletes (55 of 76, 72%) were initially disqualified from their sport but subsequently opted for unrestricted RTP after comprehensive clinical evaluation and SDM. To date, (mean follow-up 7 ± 6 years), only 1 exercise-related (1.3%) and 2 nonexercise-related GHD-associated adverse cardiac events occurred. There have been no fatalities during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study describing the experience of athletes with a known SCD-predisposing GHD who are competing at the elite level. After careful evaluation, risk stratification, and tailoring of their GHD therapy, RTP following SDM appears associated with low, nonfatal events rates at elite levels of sport.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: In severely symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and mild septal hypertrophy, mitral valve (MV) abnormalities may play an important role in MV displacement into the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract. Therefore, isolated myectomy may not relieve outflow obstruction and symptoms, and MV replacement is often the surgical alternative. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the clinical and hemodynamic results of cutting thickened secondary MV chordae combined with a shallow septal muscular resection in severely symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM and mild septal hypertrophy. METHODS: Clinical features were compared before surgery and at most recent clinical evaluation in 39 consecutive patients with obstructive HCM. RESULTS: Over a 23 ± 2 months follow-up, New York Heart Association functional class decreased from 2.9 ± 0.5 pre-operatively to 1.1 ± 1.1 post-operatively (p < 0.001), with no patient in class III at most recent evaluation. The resting outflow gradient decreased from 82 ± 43 mm Hg to 9 ± 5 mm Hg (p < 0.001) and septal thickness decreased from 17 ± 1 mm to 14 ± 2 mm (p < 0.001). No patient had MV prolapse or flail and 1 had residual moderate-to-severe MV regurgitation at most recent evaluation. MV geometry before and after surgery was compared with that of 25 consecutive patients with similar clinical profile and septal thickness that underwent isolated myectomy. After adjustment for differences in pre-operative values between the groups, the post-operative anterior MV leaflet-annulus ratio was 17% greater and tenting area 24% smaller in patients with chordal cutting, indicating that MV apparatus had moved to a more normal posterior position within the LV cavity, preventing MV systolic displacement into the outflow tract and outflow obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: This procedure relieves heart failure symptoms, abolishes LV outflow gradient, and avoids MV replacement in patients with obstructive HCM and mild septal thickness.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a major determinant of heart failure symptoms in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, may lower gradients and improve symptoms in these patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aficamten in patients with oHCM. METHODS: Patients with oHCM and LVOT gradients ≥30 mm Hg at rest or ≥50 mm Hg with Valsalva were randomized 2:1 to receive aficamten (n = 28) or placebo (n = 13) in 2 dose-finding cohorts. Doses were titrated based on gradients and ejection fraction (EF). Safety and changes in gradient, EF, New York Heart Association functional class, and cardiac biomarkers were assessed over a 10-week treatment period and after a 2-week washout. RESULTS: From baseline to 10 weeks, aficamten reduced gradients at rest (mean difference: -40 ± 27 mm Hg, and -43 ± 37 mm Hg in Cohorts 1 and 2, P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0004 vs placebo, respectively) and with Valsalva (-36 ± 27 mm Hg and -53 ± 44 mm Hg, P = 0.001 and <0.0001 vs placebo, respectively). There were modest reductions in EF (-6% ± 7.5% and -12% ± 5.9%, P = 0.007 and P < 0.0001 vs placebo, respectively). Symptomatic improvement in ≥1 New York Heart Association functional class was observed in 31% on placebo, and 43% and 64% on aficamten in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively (nonsignificant). With aficamten, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was reduced (62% relative to placebo, P = 0.0002). There were no treatment interruptions and adverse events were similar between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Aficamten resulted in substantial reductions in LVOT gradients with most patients experiencing improvement in biomarkers and symptoms. These results highlight the potential of sarcomere-targeted therapy for treatment of oHCM.",

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of PFA and thermal ablation in patients with HCM and AF. METHODS: From 2016 to 2024, patients with HCM undergoing a first AF ablation using PFA or thermal ablation (cryoballoon or radiofrequency) were retrospectively included from 3 French and Swiss centers. Freedom from atrial arrhythmia (AA) recurrence at the 12-month follow-up was assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 109 patients (median age 60 years; 68% male; 43% paroxysmal AF) with HCM underwent PFA (n = 58) or thermal ablation (n = 51) of AF. In addition to pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, extra-PV ablation was performed in 62% of PFA cases and in 18% of thermal cases. PFA was associated with shorter median procedure times than thermal ablation (81 minutes [Q1-Q3: 60-110 minutes] vs 132 minutes [Q1-Q3: 75-190 minutes]; P < 0.0001) and with less postprocedural heart failure (n = 0 vs n = 4; P = 0.03). Freedom from AA recurrence was 57% (95% CI: 46%-67%) after 12 months. PFA was associated with less AA recurrence than thermal ablation (adjusted HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23-0.91; P = 0.03). Extra-PV ablation was associated with more sustained AA recurrence with thermal ablation (HR: 3.07; 95% CI: 1.21-7.82; P = 0.02) but not with PFA (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.35-3.27; P = 0.91).

PFE is the third most common primary cardiac tumor and can be associated with neurologic events. Because endocardial trauma has been implicated in its pathogenesis, the occurrence and outcomes of PFEs in patients with HCM were retrospectively analyzed in this study. METHODS: Echocardiograms and medical records were reviewed for characteristics of PFEs in 19 patients with HCM who underwent septal myectomy. RESULTS: PFEs were detected preoperatively by transthoracic echocardiography in 5 patients, by transesophageal echocardiography in 2 patients, and perioperatively in 12 others. Three patients had previously undergone septal myectomy. Although the majority of patients (n = 11 [58%]) had 1 PFE, the number ranged from 1 to >40 (median, 1.0). PFEs arose on the aortic valve (47%), in the left ventricular outflow tract (42%), and in the right heart (11%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with HCM, 89% of PFEs were located on the aortic valve or in the left ventricular outflow tract compared with about 40% to 50% in prior studies of PFEs in general. This suggests that endocardial trauma due to turbulent left ventricular outflow tract flow may predispose to PFE development. Because of the high incidence of neurologic events among patients with HCM, PFEs may not be innocuous and should be searched for in patients with HCM and unexplained neurologic events.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Midventricular obstruction (MVO) is an uncommon variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In patients receiving septal myectomy for HCM, failure to recognize the concurrent MVO in the context of basal septum thickening can lead to inadequate excision and residual gradient. In this report, we detail the operative outcomes of MVO with and without coexistent basal septal hypertrophy. METHODS: From February 1997 through September 2018, 196 patients underwent midventricular myectomy. Medical records and follow-up databases were reviewed to obtain patient characteristics and perioperative features. RESULTS: At baseline, 156 patients (80%) were in New York Heart Association Functional Classification III/IV. Obstruction was isolated to the midventricle in 80 patients, and 63 (79%) were treated by isolated transapical myectomy. The remaining 116 patients had intraventricular obstruction at both subaortic and midcavity levels; in 108 (93%), a combined transaortic and transapical approach was adopted to achieve complete relief of the obstruction. After septal myectomy, the resting peak instantaneous gradient decreased from a median 48 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR], 23-77 mm Hg) preoperatively to 8 mm Hg (IQR, 0-19 mm Hg) before hospital dismissal. Median follow-up was 2.9 years (IQR, 0.7-5.0 years), and the estimated 1-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were 99%, 98%, and 90%, respectively. There were no late complications attributable to the transapical incision. CONCLUSIONS: Transapical exposure is a safe and effective approach for relief of midventricular obstruction, and hemodynamic results are similar to those achieved by standard myectomy for subaortic obstruction. The technique can be combined with transaortic myectomy for patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction at both levels.",

METHODS: We studied 83 consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment of symptomatic left ventricular outflow obstruction. In all study patients, a transaortic shallow septal myectomy was performed. Fibrous or muscular structures connecting the papillary muscles to the septum or free wall were resected, and fibrotic secondary chordae of the anterior mitral valve were cut selectively. RESULTS: We report one death (1.2%) during hospitalization, no iatrogenic ventricular septal defects, and two (2.4%) mitral valve replacements. At discharge, no patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV, from 49 (59%) preoperatively. Mean maximal septal thickness decreased from 24 ± 6 to 16 ± 3 mm. Mean outflow gradient decreased from 93 ± 33 to 13 ± 11 mmHg. Grade 3 or 4 mitral regurgitation was noticed in one patient postoperatively, from 32 (39%) before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Shallow septal myectomy associated with secondary mitral valve chordal cutting and papillary muscle mobilization provided excellent results offering adequate treatment of outflow obstruction.",

        "Abstract Note": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: This pilot study enrolled 36 patients with HCM and AF who underwent LAAC between April 2017 and December 2019, of whom 22 were for primary stroke prevention and 14 were for secondary prevention. Results: The patients enrolled in this study had non-obstructive (86.1%) or mild obstructive (13.9%) HCM. Patients in the Secondary Prevention Group had higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores (5.1 ± 1.4 vs. 2.6 ± 1.6, P < 0.001) and higher HAS-BLED scores (2.8 ± 1.0 vs. 1.5 ± 0.9, P < 0.001) compared with those in the Primary Prevention Group. Successful closure with satisfactory seals (residual leak ≤ 5 mm) was achieved in all patients, with complete occlusion in 86.4% of the Primary Prevention Group and 92.9% of the Secondary Prevention Group. Procedural-related complications included one pericardial effusion and one groin hematoma. One device-related thrombus was identified in the Secondary Prevention Group and resolved after anticoagulation. During a mean follow-up time of 28.4 months, one bleeding event was recorded. There were no thromboembolic events or deaths in either group, with 97.2% of the patients achieving freedom from anticoagulation therapy. Conclusions: Initial results suggest that LAAC can be a safe and feasible alternative for primary and secondary stroke prevention in selected patients with HCM and AF. Further studies with larger samples are required.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) are sometimes required after alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The primary objectives of this study were to characterize the incidence, timing, and predictors of CIED placement after ASA for HCM. METHODS: Patients were identified from the 2010-2015 Nationwide Readmissions Databases. Incidence, timing and independent predictors of CIED placement, as well as 30-day readmission rates were examined. RESULTS: There were 1296 patients (national estimate = 2864) with HCM who underwent ASA. CIED were implanted in 322 (25% overall; 14% permanent pacemaker, 11% implantable cardioverter defibrillator) during the index hospitalization. Of these, 21%, 23%, 21%, and 18% occurred on postprocedure day 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Only 17 (1.3%) patients underwent CIED implantation between discharge and 30-day follow up. Independent predictors of index hospitalization CIED implantation included older age, diabetes, heart failure, nonelective index hospital admission and hospitalization at a privately owned hospital. Nonelective 30-day readmission rates among those who did and did not undergo CIED placement during their index hospitalization, were 6.8% and 7.9%, respectively (p = .53); median time to readmission was also similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: One in four HCM patients undergoing ASA underwent CIED implantation during their index hospitalization; nearly 2/3rd during the first 48 h postprocedure. Private hospital ownership independently predicted CIED placement. More data are needed to better understand the unexpectedly high rates of CIED placement, earlier than anticipated timing of implantation and differential rates by hospital ownership.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with extreme hypertrophy, biventricular obstruction and diffuse myocardial fibrosis complicated by myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) is a rare phenotype. Evidence and guideline recommendations are still lacking for a treatment strategy. CASE PRESENTATION: Emergency coronary angiography was performed in a 38-year-old man with a 2-year history of nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presenting with acute myocardial infarction. The coronary angiogram yielded no stenotic lesions but showed a diffusely dilated left descending artery with slow blood flow. All evidence from biomarker analysis, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and imaging supported the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the left ventricular anterior wall. The echocardiogram demonstrated severe interventricular and apical hypertrophy, severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and mild right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a concentric morphological subtype of HCM with diffuse late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. Extended septal myectomy was performed 1 month later, and the patient recovered well. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with acute myocardial infarction is an indication for coronary angiography. Septal reduction surgery could be performed cautiously in HCM patients with extreme hypertrophy, biventricular obstruction and diffuse myocardial fibrosis complicated by MINOCA to improve the patient's symptoms.",

        "Abstract Note": "OBJECTIVE: Mitral regurgitation (MR) induced by systolic anterior motion in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can frequently be abolished with a proficient septal myectomy (SM) without the need for mitral-valve replacement (MVR). ACC guidelines stress the importance of volume in improving outcomes after SM, but there is a lack of data measuring the impact of volume on the need for MVR during SM. This study was designed to assess the impact of institutional volume on MVR rates using national outcomes data. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from 1998 to 2011 and a total of 6,207 patients had a diagnosis of HCM and a procedure code for SM. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent SM (group I) and SM and MVR (group II). Furthermore, patients were stratified into 3 groups based on the number of SMs at the performing institution: low experience (1-24 cumulative SMs), medium experience (25-49 SMs), and high experience (>50 SMs). These patients underwent multivariable analysis to determine the impact of institutional volume on MVR rate. RESULTS: The total MVR rate was 26%. Perioperative outcomes were worse, i.e., there were higher rates of mortality, kidney injury, and urinary complications, in group II than in group I. Only 37.6% of patients were operated on at institutions meeting the guideline criteria of >50 cumulative SMs. When compared to patients in the high-experience group, patients in the low- (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.3-3.2, p < 0.05) and medium-experience (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5-3.6, p < 0.05) groups were more likely to undergo MVR. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports from SM reference centers, national data suggest that MVR rates are quite high at SM. Patients undergoing SM at centers that do not meet the guideline standard have >2.5× the odds of undergoing MVR compared to those operated on at guideline-endorsed centers.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risks of stroke and mortality. It remains unclear whether rhythm control reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF concomitant with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: We identified AF patients with HCM who were ≥ 18 years old in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Patients using antiarrhythmic medications for ≥ 30 defined daily doses (DDDs) or receiving catheter ablation for AF constituted the rhythm control group. Patients using rate control medications for ≥ 30 DDDs constituted the rate control group. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) for adverse cardiovascular events. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 178 patients with both AF and HCM without pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. Among them, 99 were in the rhythm control group and 79 were in the rate control group. After a follow-up period of 6.47 ± 0.98 years, the rhythm control group had a lower risk of stroke than the rate control group (adjusted HR: 0.380, p = 0.031) after adjusting for covariates including use of antithrombotic agents. After excluding patients receiving catheter ablation, the rhythm control group still had a lower risk of stroke than the rate control group (adjusted HR: 0.380, p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF and HCM, rhythm control with mainly pharmacological treatment better prevented stroke than rate control in long-term follow-up. The beneficial effect of lowering stroke risk through rhythm control was independent of oral anticoagulant use.",

        "Abstract Note": "BACKGROUND: This report studies the early and medium-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of the Alfieri edge-to-edge mitral valve repair, as adjunctive therapy, to prevent and treat systolic anterior motion (SAM) at the time of septal myectomy (SM) for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: From 2009-2015, 11 consecutive patients had a trans-atrial Alfieri repair, to prevent (n = 7) or treat (n = 4) SAM at the time of SM. RESULTS: No patients were lost to follow-up. There were no perioperative or late deaths. Pre-bypass, the mean left ventricular outflow tract gradient, measured directly by simultaneous needle insertion, was 40.7 ± 19.9 mmHg at rest and 115.8 ± 30.4 mmHg on provocation with Isoproterenol, which reduced after SM and Alfieri repair and discontinuation of bypass, to a mean gradient of 8.3 ± 9.8 mmHg at rest and 25.8 ± 9.2 mmHg on provocation. One patient who required mitral valve replacement on day 4, was hospitalized at 2.7 years with heart failure requiring diuresis and remains well at 6 years. One patient developed postoperative atrial fibrillation. There were no other early or late complications. At a median follow-up of 6.6 years (international quartile range 1.2-7.4), clinical and echocardiographic data demonstrated maintained improvement in mean New York Heart Association class from 2.6 ± 0.9 preoperatively to 1.7 ± 0.4 and reduction in mean grade of mitral regurgitation from 2.7 ± 0.8 preoperatively to 0.7 ± 0.6. CONCLUSIONS: The Alfieri repair, as adjunctive therapy, for the prevention or treatment of SAM at the time of SM demonstrates satisfactory early and medium-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes supporting the ongoing utility of this approach.",
