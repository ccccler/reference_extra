        "abstract": "Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent, potentially long-lasting side effect of select chemotherapies. It contributes to suboptimal chemotherapy dosing, and its symptoms negatively impact patients' quality of life. To date, interventions to effectively prevent this toxicity have not been established, and interventions to treat CIPN have produced only modest results. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine the impact of regional cooling applied to distal extremities on the severity of CIPN. A literature review was performed using SCOPUS and PubMed databases. The search was not restricted by date but was restricted to English language. Forty-two articles were identified in the search, and six were included in the review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results related to protective effects from peripheral cooling against CIPN were variable. Four out of six studies demonstrated benefit of peripheral cooling in reducing the severity of CIPN. There was evidence to suggest that applying a relatively greater degree of cooling compared with a lesser degree may confer benefit in reducing the severity of CIPN. Both direct application of cooling and use of compression to achieve fingertip cooling showed potential benefit.",

        "abstract": "Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting and disabling side effect of taxane anticancer agents. We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of cryotherapy for CIPN prevention. Methods: Breast cancer patients treated weekly with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 for one hour) wore frozen gloves and socks on the dominant side for 90 minutes, including the entire duration of drug infusion. Symptoms on the treated sides were compared with those on the untreated (nondominant) sides. The primary end point was CIPN incidence assessed by changes in tactile sensitivity from pretreatment baseline in a monofilament test at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2. We also assessed thermosensory deficits, subjective symptoms (Patient Neuropathy Questionnaire [PNQ]), manipulative dexterity, and the time to events and hazard ratio by PNQ. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among the 40 patients, four did not reach the cumulative dose (due to the occurrence of pneumonia, severe fatigue, severe liver dysfunction, and macular edema), leaving 36 patients for analysis. None dropped out due to cold intolerance. The incidence of objective and subjective CIPN signs was clinically and statistically significantly lower on the intervention side than on the control (hand: tactile sensitivity = 27.8% vs 80.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 20.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.20 to 828.96, P < .001; foot: tacile sensitivity = 25.0% vs 63.9%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; hand: warm sense = 8.8% vs 32.4%, OR = 9.00, 95% CI = 1.25 to 394.48, P = .02; foot: warm sense: 33.4% vs 57.6%, OR = 5.00, 95% CI = 1.07 to 46.93, P = .04; hand: PNQ = 2.8% vs 41.7%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; foot: PNQ = 2.8% vs 36.1%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 2.78 to infinite, P < .001; hand: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.34; foot: HR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.38, dexterity mean delay = -2.5 seconds, SD = 12.0 seconds, vs + 8.6 seconds, SD = 25.8 seconds, P = .005). Conclusion: Cryotherapy is useful for preventing both the objective and subjective symptoms of CIPN and resultant dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Background: The recurrence score based on the 21-gene breast cancer assay predicts chemotherapy benefit if it is high and a low risk of recurrence in the absence of chemotherapy if it is low; however, there is uncertainty about the benefit of chemotherapy for most patients, who have a midrange score. Methods: We performed a prospective trial involving 10,273 women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer. Of the 9719 eligible patients with follow-up information, 6711 (69%) had a midrange recurrence score of 11 to 25 and were randomly assigned to receive either chemoendocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone. The trial was designed to show noninferiority of endocrine therapy alone for invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from invasive disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death). Results: Endocrine therapy was noninferior to chemoendocrine therapy in the analysis of invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio for invasive disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death [endocrine vs. chemoendocrine therapy], 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.24; P=0.26). At 9 years, the two treatment groups had similar rates of invasive disease-free survival (83.3% in the endocrine-therapy group and 84.3% in the chemoendocrine-therapy group), freedom from disease recurrence at a distant site (94.5% and 95.0%) or at a distant or local-regional site (92.2% and 92.9%), and overall survival (93.9% and 93.8%). The chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival varied with the combination of recurrence score and age (P=0.004), with some benefit of chemotherapy found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16 to 25. Conclusion: Adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence score, although some benefit of chemotherapy was found in some women 50 years of age or younger.

        "abstract": "Background: The optimal duration of extended endocrine therapy beyond five years after initial aromatase inhibitor-based adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is still unknown. Therefore, we conducted a clinical trial to compare two different extended endocrine therapy durations. Methods: In the randomized phase III IDEAL trial, postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly allocated to either 2.5 or five years of letrozole after the initial five years of any endocrine therapy. The primary end point was disease free survival (DFS), and secondary end points were overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free interval (DMFi), new primary breast cancer, and safety. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined using Cox regression analysis. All analyses were by intention-to-treat principle. Results: A total of 1824 patients were assigned to either 2.5 years (n = 909) or five years (n = 915) of letrozole, with a median follow-up of 6.6 years. A DFS event occurred in 152 patients in the five-year group, compared with 163 patients in the 2.5-year group (HR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 1.16). OS (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.38) and DMFi (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.45) were not different between both groups. A reduction in occurrence of second primary breast cancer was observed with five years of treatment (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.81). Subgroup analysis did not identify patients who benefit from five-year extended therapy. Conclusion: This study showed no superiority of five years over 2.5 years of extended adjuvant letrozole after an initial five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The MINDACT trial showed excellent 5-year distant metastasis-free survival of 94·7% (95% CI 92·5-96·2) in patients with breast cancer of high clinical and low genomic risk who did not receive chemotherapy. We present long-term follow-up results together with an exploratory analysis by age. Methods: MINDACT was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 112 academic and community hospitals in nine European countries. Patients aged 18-70 years, with histologically confirmed primary invasive breast cancer (stage T1, T2, or operable T3) with up to three positive lymph nodes, no distant metastases, and a WHO performance status of 0-1 were enrolled and their genomic risk (using the MammaPrint 70-gene signature) and clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online) were determined. Patients with low clinical and low genomic risk results did not receive chemotherapy, and patients with high clinical and high genomic risk did receive chemotherapy (mostly anthracycline-based or taxane-based, or a combination thereof). Patients with discordant risk results (ie, patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, and those with low clinical risk but high genomic risk) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy or not based on either the clinical risk or the genomic risk. Randomisation was done centrally and used a minimisation technique that was stratified by institution, risk group, and clinical-pathological characteristics. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was to test whether the distant metastasis-free survival rate at 5 years in patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk not receiving chemotherapy had a lower boundary of the 95% CI above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%. In the primary test population of patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who adhered to the treatment allocation of no chemotherapy and had no change in risk post-enrolment. Here, we present updated follow-up as well as an exploratory analysis of a potential age effect (≤50 years vs >50 years) and an analysis by nodal status for patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative disease. These analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and the European Clinical Trials database, EudraCT2005-002625-31. Recruitment is complete and further long-term follow-up is ongoing. Results: Between Feb 8, 2007, and July 11, 2011, 6693 patients were enrolled. On Feb 26, 2020, median follow-up was 8·7 years (IQR 7·8-9·7). The updated 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate for patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk receiving no chemotherapy (primary test population, n=644) was 95·1% (95% CI 93·1-96·6), which is above the predefined non-inferiority boundary of 92%, supporting the previous analysis and proving MINDACT as a positive de-escalation trial. Patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (n=749) or not (n=748); this was the intention-to-treat population. The 8-year estimates for distant metastasis-free survival in the intention-to-treat population were 92·0% (95% CI 89·6-93·8) for chemotherapy versus 89·4% (86·8-91·5) for no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0·66; 95% CI 0·48-0·92). An exploratory analysis confined to the subset of patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease (1358 [90.7%] of 1497 randomly assigned patients, of whom 676 received chemotherapy and 682 did not) shows different effects of chemotherapy administration on 8-year distant metastasis-free survival according to age: 93·6% (95% CI 89·3-96·3) with chemotherapy versus 88·6% (83·5-92·3) without chemotherapy in 464 women aged 50 years or younger (absolute difference 5·0 percentage points [SE 2·8, 95% CI -0·5 to 10·4]) and 90·2% (86·8-92·7) versus 90·0% (86·6-92·6) in 894 women older than 50 years (absolute difference 0·2 percentage points [2·1, -4·0 to 4·4]). The 8-year distant metastasis-free survival in the exploratory analysis by nodal status in these patients was 91·7% (95% CI 88·1-94·3) with chemotherapy and 89·2% (85·2-92·2) without chemotherapy in 699 node-negative patients (absolute difference 2·5 percentage points [SE 2·3, 95% CI -2·1 to 7·2]) and 91·2% (87·2-94·0) versus 89·9% (85·8-92·8) for 658 patients with one to three positive nodes (absolute difference 1·3 percentage points [2·4, -3·5 to 6·1]). Conclusion: With a more mature follow-up approaching 9 years, the 70-gene signature shows an intact ability of identifying among women with high clinical risk, a subgroup, namely patients with a low genomic risk, with an excellent distant metastasis-free survival when treated with endocrine therapy alone. For these women the magnitude of the benefit from adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy remains small (2·6 percentage points) and is not enhanced by nodal positivity. However, in an underpowered exploratory analysis this benefit appears to be age-dependent, as it is only seen in women younger than 50 years where it reaches a clinically relevant threshold of 5 percentage points. Although, possibly due to chemotherapy-induced ovarian function suppression, it should be part of informed, shared decision making. Further study is needed in younger women, who might need reinforced endocrine therapy to forego chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose The PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence (ROR) score has been validated in randomized clinical trials to predict 10-year distant recurrence (DR). The value of Prosigna for predicting DR was examined in a comprehensive nationwide Danish cohort consisting of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer treated with 5 years of endocrine therapy alone. Patients and Methods Using the population-based Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group database, follow-up data were collected on all patients diagnosed from 2000 through 2003 who, by nationwide guidelines, were treated with endocrine therapy for 5 years. Primary tumor blocks from 2,740 patients were tested with Prosigna and, after determination of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, data from 2,558 hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative samples were analyzed, including 1,395 node-positive patients. Fine and Gray models were applied to determine the prognostic value of ROR for DR. Results Median follow-up for recurrence was 9.2 years. Twenty-six percent of the node-positive patients were classified as low ROR (n = 359) with a DR risk of 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9% to 6.1%) versus a DR risk of 22.1% (95% CI, 18.6% to 25.8%) at 10 years for patients classified as high ROR (n = 648). Node-negative patients classified as low and high ROR had a risk of DR of 5.0% (95% CI, 2.9% to 8.0%) and 17.8% (95% CI, 14.0% to 22.0%), respectively. Luminal B tumors (n = 947; DR risk, 18.4% [95% CI: 15.7% to 21.3%]) had a significantly worse outcome than luminal A tumors (n = 1,474,;DR risk, 7.6% [95% CI: 6.1% to 9.2%]; P < .001). Conclusion Prosigna ROR score improved the prediction of outcome in this nationwide Danish population. In a real-world setting, Prosigna can reliably identify node-negative patients and a significant proportion of patients with one to three positive nodes who can be spared treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy.",

Methods: To conduct a within-patient comparison of the prognostic value of 6 multigene signatures in women with early ER-positive breast cancer who received endocrine therapy for 5 years. Results: This retrospective biomarker analysis included 774 postmenopausal women with ER-positive ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer. This analysis was performed as a preplanned secondary study of data from the Anastrozole or Tamoxifen Alone or Combined randomized clinical trial comparing 5-year treatment with anastrozole vs tamoxifen with 10-year follow-up data.

This study examined the Breast Cancer Index [BCI; HOXB13/IL17BR ratio (H/I)] as a predictive biomarker of EET benefit in patients from the Investigation on the Duration of Extended Adjuvant Letrozole trial. Methods: BCI was tested in primary tumor specimens from 908 patients randomized to receive 2.5 versus 5 years of extended letrozole. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free interval. Cox models and likelihood ratios tested the interaction between EET and BCI (H/I). Results: BCI (H/I)-high significantly predicted benefit from extended letrozole in the overall cohort [HR 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.84;   = 0.011] and any aromatase inhibitor subset [HR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.73;   = 0.004), whereas BCI (H/I)-low patients did not derive significant benefit (HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.58-1.56;   = 0.84 and HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.53-1.55;   = 0.71, respectively) treatment to biomarker interaction was significant (  = 0.045,   = 0.025, respectively). BCI identified approximately 50% of patients with clinically high-risk disease that did not benefit, and with clinically low-risk disease that derived significant benefit, from an additional 2.5 years of EET. Conclusion: BCI (H/I) predicted preferential benefit from 5 versus 2.5 years of EET and identified patients with improved outcomes from completing 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Findings expand the clinical utility of BCI (H/I) to a broader range of patients and beyond prognostic risk factors as a predictive endocrine response biomarker for early-stage HR  breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Extending the duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces the risk of recurrence in a subset of women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. Validated predictive biomarkers of endocrine response could significantly improve patient selection for extended therapy. Breast cancer index (BCI) [HOXB13/IL17BR ratio (H/I)] was evaluated for its ability to predict benefit from extended endocrine therapy in patients previously randomized in the Adjuvant Tamoxifen-To Offer More? (aTTom) trial. Methods: Trans-aTTom is a multi-institutional, prospective-retrospective study in patients with available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor blocks. BCI testing and central determination of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status by immunohistochemistry were carried out blinded to clinical outcome. Survival endpoints were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression with recurrence-free interval (RFI) as the primary endpoint. Interaction between extended endocrine therapy and BCI (H/I) was assessed using the likelihood ratio test. Results: Of 583 HR+, N+ patients analyzed, 49% classified as BCI (H/I)-High derived a significant benefit from 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen treatment [hazard ratio (HR): 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.86; 10.2% absolute risk reduction based on RFI, P = 0.027]. BCI (H/I)-low patients showed no significant benefit from extended endocrine therapy (HR: 1.07; 95% CI 0.69-1.65; -0.2% absolute risk reduction; P = 0.768). Continuous BCI (H/I) levels predicted the magnitude of benefit from extended tamoxifen, whereas centralized ER and PR did not. Interaction between extended tamoxifen treatment and BCI (H/I) was statistically significant (P = 0.012), adjusting for clinicopathological factors. Conclusion: BCI by high H/I expression was predictive of endocrine response and identified a subset of HR+, N+ patients with significant benefit from 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. These data provide further validation, consistent with previous MA.17 data, establishing level 1B evidence for BCI as a predictive biomarker of benefit from extended endocrine therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: EndoPredict (EPclin) is a prognostic test validated to inform decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy alone for patients with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Here, we determine the performance of EPclin for estimating 10-year distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) rates for those who received adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) alone compared to those with chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy (ET + C). Methods: A total of 3746 women were included in this joint analysis. 2630 patients received 5 years of ET alone (ABCSG-6/8, TransATAC) and 1116 patients received ET + C (GEICAM 2003-02/9906). The primary objective was to evaluate the ability of EPclin to provide an estimate of the 10-year DR rate as a continuous function of EPclin separately for ET alone and ET + C. Cox proportional hazard models were used for these analyses. Results: EPclin was highly prognostic for DR in women who received ET alone (HR 2.79 (2.49-3.13), P < 0.0001) as well as in those who received ET + C (HR 2.27 (1.99-2.59), P < 0.0001). Women who received ET + C had significantly smaller increases in 10-year DR rates with the increasing EPclin score than those receiving ET alone (EPclin = 5; 12% ET + C vs. 20% ET alone). We observed a significant positive interaction between EPclin and treatment groups (P-  = 0.022). Conclusion: In this comparative non-randomised analysis, the rate of increase in DR with EPclin score was significantly reduced in women who received ET + C versus ET alone. Our indirect comparisons suggest that a high EPclin score can predict chemotherapy benefit in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative disease.",

The HOXB13/IL17BR (H/I) biomarker predicts recurrence risk in ER-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. H/I was evaluated in MA.17 trial for prognostic performance for late recurrence and treatment benefit from extended adjuvant letrozole. Methods: A prospective-retrospective, nested case-control design of 83 recurrences matched to 166 nonrecurrences from letrozole- and placebo-treated patients within MA.17 was conducted. Expression of H/I within primary tumors was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with a prespecified cutpoint. The predictive ability of H/I for ascertaining benefit from letrozole was determined using multivariable conditional logistic regression including standard clinicopathological factors as covariates. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: High H/I was statistically significantly associated with a decrease in late recurrence in patients receiving extended letrozole therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16 to 0.75; P = .007). In an adjusted model with standard clinicopathological factors, high H/I remained statistically significantly associated with patient benefit from letrozole (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.73; P = .006). Reduction in the absolute risk of recurrence at 5 years was 16.5% for patients with high H/I (P = .007). The interaction between H/I and letrozole treatment was statistically significant (P = .03). Conclusion: In the absence of extended letrozole therapy, high H/I identifies a subgroup of ER-positive patients disease-free after 5 years of tamoxifen who are at risk for late recurrence. When extended endocrine therapy with letrozole is prescribed, high H/I predicts benefit from therapy and a decreased probability of late disease recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Background: According to current guidelines, molecular tests predicting the outcome of breast cancer patients can be used to assist in making treatment decisions after consideration of conventional markers. We developed and validated a gene expression signature predicting the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy. Methods: RNA levels assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were used to calculate a risk score (Endopredict, EP) consisting of eight cancer-related and three reference genes. EP was combined with nodal status and tumor size into a comprehensive risk score, EPclin. Both prespecified risk scores including cutoff values to determine a risk group for each patient (low and high) were validated independently in patients from two large randomized phase III trials [Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG)-6: n = 378, ABCSG-8: n = 1,324]. Results: In both validation cohorts, continuous EP was an independent predictor of distant recurrence in multivariate analysis (ABCSG-6: P = 0.010, ABCSG-8: P < 0.001). Combining Adjuvant!Online, quantitative ER, Ki67, and treatment with EP yielded a prognostic power significantly superior to the clinicopathologic factors alone [c-indices: 0.764 vs. 0.750, P = 0.024 (ABCSG-6) and 0.726 vs. 0.701, P = 0.003 (ABCSG-8)]. EPclin had c-indices of 0.788 and 0.732 and resulted in 10-year distant recurrence rates of 4% and 4% in EPclin low-risk and 28% and 22% in EPclin high-risk patients in ABCSG-6 (P < 0.001) and ABCSG-8 (P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The multigene EP risk score provided additional prognostic information to the risk of distant recurrence of breast cancer patients, independent from clinicopathologic parameters. The EPclin score outperformed all conventional clinicopathologic risk factors.",

In this retrospective study, we aimed to explore the efficacy of anthracycline-taxane (A-T)-based or anthracycline-taxane/carboplatin (A-TP)-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BRCA1/2-mutated TNBC. A total of 1585 operable primary breast cancer patients were treated with either neoadjuvant A-T (n = 886) or A-TP regimen (n = 699). BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations were determined in all subjects. Pathological complete response (pCR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated. Of the entire cohort, 102 patients (6.4%) carried a pathogenic BRCA1/2 germline mutation. After a median follow-up of 81 months, no significant differences in survival between the A-T and A-TP arms were found in the entire cohort. However, among 288 TNBC patients, BRCA1/2 mutation carriers had significantly better survival when treated with the A-TP regimen than with the A-T regimen (5-year RFS: 82.6% vs 47.9%; P = .024; 5-year DRFS: 88.5% vs 46.9%; P = .010; 5-year OS: 88.2% vs 49.9%; P = .036). Multivariate analyses revealed that the A-TP regimen was a significantly favourable factor for RFS and DRFS and showed a trend towards better OS when compared with the A-T regimen in BRCA1/2-mutated TNBC (RFS: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.91, P = .035; DRFS: HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.80; P = .025; OS: HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06-1.49; P = .14). Our study suggested that BRCA1/2-mutated TNBC patients gain a survival benefit when carboplatin is added to standard A-T-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: We previously reported that four cycles of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC) produced superior disease-free survival (DFS) compared with four cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) in early breast cancer. Older women are under-represented in adjuvant chemotherapy trials. In our trial 16% of patients were > or = 65 years. We now report 7-year results for DFS and overall survival (OS) as well as the impact of age, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status on outcome and toxicity. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either four cycles of standard-dose AC (60/600 mg/m(2); n = 510), or TC (75/600 mg/m(2); n = 506), administered by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Results: The median age in women younger than 65, was 50 years (range, 27 to 64) and for women > or = 65 was 69 years (range, 65 to 77). Baseline characteristics in the two age subgroups were generally well matched, except that older women tended to have more lymph node involvement. At a median of 7 years follow-up, the difference in DFS between TC and AC was significant (81% TC v 75% AC; P = .033; hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98) as was OS (87% TC v 82% AC; P = .032; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.97). TC was superior in older patients as well as younger patients. There was no interaction of hormone-receptor status or HER-2 status and treatment. Older women experienced more febrile neutropenia with TC and more anemia with AC. Conclusion: With longer follow-up, four cycles of TC was superior to standard AC (DFS and OS) and was a tolerable regimen in both older and younger patients.",

Methods: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-31 compared doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel every 3 weeks (group 1) with the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab beginning with the first dose of paclitaxel (group 2). The North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831 compared three regimens: doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel (group A), the same regimen followed by 52 weeks of trastuzumab after paclitaxel (group B), and the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab initiated concomitantly with paclitaxel (group C). The studies were amended to include a joint analysis comparing groups 1 and A (the control group) with groups 2 and C (the trastuzumab group). Group B was excluded because trastuzumab was not given concurrently with paclitaxel. Results: By March 15, 2005, 394 events (recurrent, second primary cancer, or death before recurrence) had been reported, triggering the first scheduled interim analysis. Of these, 133 were in the trastuzumab group and 261 in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.48; P<0.0001). This result crossed the early stopping boundary. The absolute difference in disease-free survival between the trastuzumab group and the control group was 12 percent at three years. Trastuzumab therapy was associated with a 33 percent reduction in the risk of death (P=0.015). The three-year cumulative incidence of class III or IV congestive heart failure or death from cardiac causes in the trastuzumab group was 4.1 percent in trial B-31 and 2.9 percent in trial N9831. Conclusion: Trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improves outcomes among women with surgically removed HER2-positive breast cancer.

        "abstract": "Background: We compared docetaxel with vinorelbine for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. Women with tumors that overexpressed HER2/neu were also assigned to receive concomitant treatment with trastuzumab or no such treatment. Methods: We randomly assigned 1010 women with axillary-node-positive or high-risk node-negative cancer to receive three cycles of docetaxel or vinorelbine, followed by (in both groups) three cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. The 232 women whose tumors had an amplified HER2/neu gene were further assigned to receive or not to receive nine weekly trastuzumab infusions. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. Results: Recurrence-free survival at three years was better with docetaxel than with vinorelbine (91 percent vs. 86 percent; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.85; P=0.005), but overall survival did not differ between the groups (P=0.15). Within the subgroup of patients who had HER2/neu-positive cancer, those who received trastuzumab had better three-year recurrence-free survival than those who did not receive the antibody (89 percent vs. 78 percent; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.83; P=0.01). Docetaxel was associated with more adverse effects than was vinorelbine. Trastuzumab was not associated with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction or cardiac failure. Conclusion: Adjuvant treatment with docetaxel, as compared with vinorelbine, improves recurrence-free survival in women with early breast cancer. A short course of trastuzumab administered concomitantly with docetaxel or vinorelbine is effective in women with breast cancer who have an amplified HER2/neu gene.

Methods: A total of 2,005 female patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following regimens: (I) sequential A x 4 (doses) --> T x 4 --> C x 4 with doses every 3 weeks, (II) sequential A x 4 --> T x 4 --> C x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim, (III) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 3 weeks, or (IV) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim. Results: A protocol-specified analysis was performed at a median follow-up of 36 months: 315 patients had experienced relapse or died, compared with 515 expected treatment failures. Dose-dense treatment improved the primary end point, DFS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; P =.010), and OS (RR = 0.69; P =.013). Four-year DFS was 82% for the dose-dense regimens and 75% for the others. There was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.

We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new nonanthracycline regimen with trastuzumab. Methods: We randomly assigned 3222 women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel every 3 weeks (AC-T), the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (AC-T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (TCH). The primary study end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival and safety. Results: At a median follow-up of 65 months, 656 events triggered this protocol-specified analysis. The estimated disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 75% among patients receiving AC-T, 84% among those receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, and 81% among those receiving TCH. Estimated rates of overall survival were 87%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. No significant differences in efficacy (disease-free or overall survival) were found between the two trastuzumab regimens, whereas both were superior to AC-T. The rates of congestive heart failure and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group (P<0.001). Eight cases of acute leukemia were reported: seven in the groups receiving the anthracycline-based regimens and one in the TCH group subsequent to receiving an anthracycline outside the study. Conclusion: The addition of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improved disease-free and overall survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. The risk-benefit ratio favored the nonanthracycline TCH regimen over AC-T plus trastuzumab, given its similar efficacy, fewer acute toxic effects, and lower risks of cardiotoxicity and leukemia.

Methods: Node-positive breast cancer patients who were aged 70 years or younger were randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: CMF for six cycles (oral cyclophosphamide); EC for eight cycles (epirubicin 60 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2); day 1 every 3 weeks); and HEC for eight cycles (epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 830 mg/m(2); day 1 every 3 weeks). Results: Two hundred fifty-five, 267, and 255 eligible patients were treated with CMF, EC, and HEC, respectively. Patient characteristics were well balanced among the three arms. One and three cases of congestive heart failure were reported in the EC and HEC arms, respectively. Three cases of acute myeloid leukemia were reported in the HEC arm.

We investigated whether the addition of anthracyclines would improve pathological complete response compared with a carboplatin-taxane regimen, when given in combination with the HER2-targeted agents trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Methods: The TRAIN-2 study is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial being done in 37 hospitals in the Netherlands. We recruited patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly allocated using central randomisation software (1:1 ratio) with minimisation without a random component, stratified by tumour stage, nodal stage, oestrogen receptor status, and age, to receive 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m ), epirubicin (90 mg/m ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m ) every 3 weeks for three cycles followed by paclitaxel (80 mg/m  on days 1 and 8) and carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL per min on day 1 or optionally, as per hospital preference, AUC 3 mg/mL per min on days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks for six cycles, or to receive nine cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin at the same dose and schedule as in the anthracycline group. Patients in both study groups received trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, loading dose 8 mg/kg) and pertuzumab (420 mg, loading dose 840 mg) concurrently with all chemotherapy cycles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response in breast and axilla (ypT0/is ypN0) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one treatment cycle according to actual treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and follow-up for long-term outcome is ongoing. Results: Between Dec 9, 2013, and Jan 14, 2016, 438 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (219 patients to each group), of whom 418 were evaluable for the primary endpoint (212 in the anthracycline group and 206 in the non-anthracycline group). The median follow-up for all patients was 19 months (IQR 16-23 months). A pathological complete response was recorded in 141 (67%, 95% CI 60-73) of 212 patients in the anthracycline group and in 140 (68%, 61-74) of 206 in the non-anthracycline group (p=0·95). One patient randomly allocated to the non-anthracycline group did receive anthracyclines and was thus included in the anthracycline group for safety analyses; therefore, for the safety analyses there were 220 patients in the anthracycline group and 218 in the non-anthracycline group. Serious adverse events were reported in 61 (28%) of 220 patients in the anthracycline group and in 49 (22%) of 218 in the non-anthracycline group. The most common adverse events of any cause were grade 3 or worse neutropenia (in 131 [60%] of 220 patients in the anthracycline group vs 118 [54%] of 218 in the non-anthracycline group), grade 3 or worse diarrhoea (26 [12%] vs 37 [18%]), and grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy (66 [30%] vs 68 [31%]), with no substantial differences between the groups. Grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia was more common in the anthracycline group than in the non-anthracycline group (23 [10%] vs three [1%], p<0·0001). Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was rare in both groups (two [1%] of 220 vs 0 of 218). One patient in the anthracycline group died because of a pulmonary embolism, which was possibly treatment related. Conclusion: In view of the high proportion of pathological complete responses recorded in both groups and the fact that febrile neutropenia was more frequent in the anthracycline group, omitting anthracyclines from neoadjuvant treatment regimens might be a preferred approach in the presence of dual HER2 blockade in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer. Long-term follow-up is required to confirm these results.",

        "abstract": "Background: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) implemented protocol B-15 to compare 2 months of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) and cyclophosphamide (AC) with 6 months of conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in patients with breast cancer nonresponsive to tamoxifen (TAM, T). A second aim was to determine whether AC followed in 6 months by intravenous (IV) CMF was more effective than AC without reinduction therapy. Through 3 years of follow-up, findings from 2,194 patients indicate no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS, P = .5), distant disease-free survival (DDFS, P = .5) or survival (S, P = .8) among the three groups. Since the outcome from AC and CMF was almost identical, the issue arises concerning which regimen is more appropriate for the treatment of breast cancer patients. AC seems preferable since, following total mastectomy, AC was completed on day 63 versus day 154 for conventional CMF; patients visited health professionals three times as often for conventional CMF as for AC; women on AC received therapy on each of 4 days versus on each of 84 days for conventional CMF; and nausea-control medication was given for about 84 days to conventional CMF patients versus for about 12 days to patients on AC. The difference in the amount of alopecia between the two treatment groups was less than anticipated. While alopecia was almost universally observed following AC therapy, 71% of the CMF patients also had hair loss and, in 41%, the loss was greater than 50%. This study and NSABP B-16, which evaluates the worth of AC therapy in TAM-responsive patients, indicate the merit of 2 months of AC therapy for all positive-node breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: The first reported effective adjuvant combination regimen for patients with operable breast cancer comprised oral cyclophosphamide (C) days 1-14 with intravenous methotrexate (M) and fluorouracil (F) on days 1 and 8, repeated every 28 days ('classical' CMF). These drugs have since been extensively used with or without endocrine therapies and/or other cytotoxics, as well as with radiation therapy to the chest wall yielding conflicting results. Although doses and schedules have varied widely, the combination of these three drugs has been generically referred to as CMF. Evidence exists that reducing the dose and/or altering the schedule of CMF ('modified' CMF) have compromised its efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. Reduction below standard dose of a similar regimen also gave inferior results in the adjuvant setting. In fact, the recently reported improved outcome of adding radiation therapy to CMF was only demonstrated in comparisons with a 'modified' CMF. Furthermore, trials in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which did not demonstrate any significant benefit for the addition of adjuvant CMF to tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone, also used 'modified' CMF. Therefore, adherence to the 'classical' dose and schedule is recommended when CMF is used in adjuvant therapy.",

Methods: Patients with stage I centrally confirmed HER2+ BC were randomly assigned 3:1 to T-DM1 or TH and received T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 17 cycles or T 80 mg/m  IV with H once every week × 12 weeks (4 mg/kg load →2 mg/kg), followed by H × 39 weeks (6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks). The co-primary objectives were to compare the incidence of clinically relevant toxicities (CRTs) in patients treated with T-DM1 versus TH and to evaluate iDFS in patients receiving T-DM1. Results: The analysis population includes all 497 patients who initiated protocol therapy (383 T-DM1 and 114 TH). CRTs were experienced by 46% of patients on T-DM1 and 47% of patients on TH (  = .83). The 3-year iDFS for T-DM1 was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.3 to 99.3), which rejected the null hypothesis (  < .0001). Serially collected patient-reported outcomes indicated that patients treated with T-DM1 had less neuropathy and alopecia and better work productivity compared with patients on TH. Conclusion: Among patients with stage I HER2+ BC, one year of adjuvant T-DM1 was associated with excellent 3-year iDFS, but was not associated with fewer CRT compared with TH.",

We investigated the combination of pertuzumab or trastuzumab, or both, with docetaxel and the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. Methods: In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study, treatment-naive women with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally and stratified by operable, locally advanced, and inflammatory breast cancer, and by hormone receptor expression to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of: trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2), escalating, if tolerated, to 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks; group A) or pertuzumab (loading dose 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) or pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C) or pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D). The primary endpoint, examined in the intention-to-treat population, was pathological complete response in the breast. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Of 417 eligible patients, 107 were randomly assigned to group A, 107 to group B, 107 to group C, and 96 to group D. Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a significantly improved pathological complete response rate (49 of 107 patients; 45·8% [95% CI 36·1-55·7]) compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group A; 31 of 107; 29·0% [20·6-38·5]; p=0·0141). 23 of 96 (24·0% [15·8-33·7]) women given pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D) had a pathological complete response, as did 18 of 107 (16·8% [10·3-25·3]) given pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (61 of 107 women in group A, 48 of 107 in group B, one of 108 in group C, and 52 of 94 in group D), febrile neutropenia (eight, nine, none, and seven, respectively), and leucopenia (13, five, none, and seven, respectively). The number of serious adverse events was similar in groups A, B, and D (15-20 serious adverse events per group in 10-17% of patients) but lower in group C (four serious adverse events in 4% of patients). Conclusion: Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a significantly improved pathological complete response rate compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel, without substantial differences in tolerability. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy eradicated tumours in a proportion of women and showed a favourable safety profile. These findings justify further exploration in adjuvant trials and support the neoadjuvant approach for accelerating drug assessment in early breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Response rates in HER2-overexpressing EBC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab (T) have been improved by addition of pertuzumab (P). The prospective, phase II, neoadjuvant WSG-ADAPT HER2+/HR- trial assessed whether patients with strong early response to dual blockade alone might achieve pathological complete response (pCR) comparable to that of patients receiving dual blockade and chemotherapy. Methods: Female patients with HER2+/HR- EBC (M0) were randomized (5:2) to 12 weeks of T + P ± weekly paclitaxel (pac) at 80 mg/m2. Early response was defined as proliferation decrease ≥30% of Ki-67 (versus baseline) or low cellularity (<500 invasive tumor cells) in the 3-week biopsy. The trial was designed to test non-inferiority for pCR in early responding patients of the T + P arm versus all chemotherapy-treated patients. Results: From February 2014 to December 2015, 160 patients were screened, 92 were randomized to T + P and 42 to T + P+pac. Baseline characteristics were well balanced (median age 54 versus 51.5 years, cT2 51.1 versus 52.4%, cN0 54.3 versus 61.9%); 91.3% of patients completed T + P per protocol and 92.9% T + P+pac. The pCR rate in the T + P+pac arm was 90.5%, compared with 36.3% in the T + P arm as a whole. In the T + P arm, 24/92 were classified as non-responders, and their pCR rate was only 8.3% compared with 44.7% in responders (38/92) and 42.9% in patients with unclassified early response (30/92). No new safety signals were observed in the study population. Conclusion: Addition of taxane monotherapy to dual HER2 blockade in a 12-week neoadjuvant setting substantially increases pCR rates in HER2+/HR- EBC compared with dual blockade alone, even within early responders to dual blockade. Early non-response under dual blockade strongly predicts failure to achieve pCR.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recent studies demonstrate that addition of neoadjuvant (NA) carboplatin to anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response (pCR) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Effectiveness of anthracycline-free platinum combinations in TNBC is not well known. Here, we report efficacy of NA carboplatin + docetaxel (CbD) in TNBC. Methods: The study population includes 190 patients with stage I-III TNBC treated uniformly on two independent prospective cohorts. All patients were prescribed NA chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin (AUC 6) + docetaxel (75 mg/m ) given every 21 days × 6 cycles. pCR (no evidence of invasive tumor in the breast and axilla) and residual cancer burden (RCB) were evaluated. Results: Among 190 patients, median tumor size was 35 mm, 52% were lymph node positive, and 16% had germline BRCA1/2 mutation. The overall pCR and RCB 0 + 1 rates were 55% and 68%, respectively. pCRs in patients with BRCA-associated and wild-type TNBC were 59% and 56%, respectively (P = 0.83). On multivariable analysis, stage III disease was the only factor associated with a lower likelihood of achieving a pCR. Twenty-one percent and 7% of patients, respectively, experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event. Conclusion: The CbD regimen was well tolerated and yielded high pCR rates in both BRCA-associated and wild-type TNBC. These results are comparable with pCR achieved with the addition of carboplatin to anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy. Our study adds to the existing data on the efficacy of platinum agents in TNBC and supports further exploration of the CbD regimen in randomized studies. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 649-57. ©2016 AACR.",

        "abstract": "Background: Previous trials showed promising antitumor activity and an acceptable safety profile associated with pembrolizumab in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer. Whether the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy would significantly increase the percentage of patients with early triple-negative breast cancer who have a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes) at definitive surgery is unclear. Methods: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (784 patients; the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (390 patients; the placebo-chemotherapy group); the two groups then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo, and both groups received doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, the patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were a pathological complete response at the time of definitive surgery and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Results: At the first interim analysis, among the first 602 patients who underwent randomization, the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 64.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.9 to 69.5) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 51.2% (95% CI, 44.1 to 58.3) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (estimated treatment difference, 13.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.4 to 21.8; P<0.001). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2.7 to 25.0), 58 of 784 patients (7.4%) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 46 of 390 patients (11.8%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group had disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, had local or distant recurrence or a second primary tumor, or died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.93). Across all treatment phases, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 78.0% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 73.0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% (3 patients) and 0.3% (1 patient), respectively. Conclusion: Among patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, the percentage with a pathological complete response was significantly higher among those who received pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy than among those who received placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

However, no studies have assessed the effects of the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin without anthracycline with taxane-based and anthracycline-based regimens. The NeoCART study was designed as a multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of docetaxel combined with carboplatin in untreated stage II-III TNBC. All eligible patients were randomly assigned, at a 1:1 ratio, to an experimental docetaxel plus carboplatin (DCb) for six cycles group (DCb group) or an epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide for four cycles followed by docetaxel for four cycles group (EC-D group). PCR (ypT0/is ypN0) was evaluated as the primary outcome. Between 1 September 2016 and 31 December 2019, 93 patients were randomly assigned and 88 patients were evaluated for the primary endpoint (44 patients in each group). In the primary endpoint analysis, 27 patients in the DCb group (61.4%, 95% CI 47.0-75.8) and 17 patients in the EC-D group achieved a pCR (38.6%, 95% CI 24.3-53.0; odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI 2.4-43.1; P  = .004). Noninferiority was met, and the DCb regimen was confirmed to be superior to the EC-D regimen (P = .044, superiority margin of 5%).

We assessed the addition of 1 year of trastuzumab to a non-anthracycline regimen, docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide, in patients with HER2-amplified early stage breast cancer and examined whether this regimen was equally effective in patients with TOP2A-amplified and TOP2A-non-amplified disease. Methods: This was an open-label, single-group, phase 2 study. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years; had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less; HER2-amplified early stage breast cancer; operable, histologically confirmed, invasive carcinoma of the breast; adequate tumour specimen available for FISH analysis of TOP2A status; and adequate haematological, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. Patients received four 21-day cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), plus intravenous cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), plus intravenous trastuzumab 4 mg/kg (loading dose) on day 1 and 2 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 during chemotherapy, followed by trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every three weeks for the remainder of 1 year. The primary endpoint was 2-year DFS in TOP2A-amplified and TOP2A-non-amplified patients; the primary analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: 493 patients were enrolled between June 15, 2007, and Aug 5, 2009. After a median follow-up of 36·1 months (IQR 35·5-36·7), 2-year DFS was 97·8% (95% CI 94·2-99·2) and 2-year overall survival was 99·5% (95% CI 96·2-99·9) for the 190 patients with TOP2A-amplified disease; 2-year DFS was 97·9% (95% CI 94·9-99·1) and 2-year overall survival was 98·8% (95% CI 96·2-99·6) for the 248 patients with TOP2A-non-amplified disease; 55 patients were not assessable for TOP2A status. In the 486 patients who received at least one dose of study drug, the most common adverse events of any grade were fatigue (284 patients, 58·4%), neutropenia (250, 51·4%), and nausea (217, 44·7%). The most common grade 3-4 toxic effects were neutropenia (229, 47·1%), febrile neutropenia (30, 6·2%), fatigue (21, 4·3%), and diarrhoea (16, 3·3%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 29 (6·0%) patients (12 [2·5%] grade 1, 15 [3·1%] grade 2, and two [0·4%] grade 3). 23 patients had at least one study-related serious adverse event. 16 patients stopped trastuzumab because of cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion: A short, four-cycle regimen of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide combined with trastuzumab could be an option for adjuvant treatment of women with lower risk HER2-amplified early breast cancer, irrespective of TOP2A status.",

        "abstract": "Background: Preclinical data suggest that triple-negative breast cancers are sensitive to interstrand crosslinking agents, and that synergy may exist for the combination of a taxane, trastuzumab, and a platinum salt for HER2-positive breast cancer. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy of the addition of carboplatin to neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer. Methods: Patients with previously untreated, non-metastatic, stage II-III, triple-negative breast cancer and HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were treated for 18 weeks with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) once a week) and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (20 mg/m(2) once a week). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer received simultaneous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). Patients with HER2-positive disease received simultaneous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg initial dose with subsequent doses of 6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) and lapatinib (750 mg daily). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with dynamic allocation and minimisation, stratified by biological subtype and Ki-67 level to receive, at the same time as the backbone regimens, either carboplatin (AUC 1·5 [2·0 for the first 329 patients] once a week) or no carboplatin. The primary endpoint the proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response (defined as ypT0 ypN0), analysed for all patients who started treatment; a p value of less than 0·2 was deemed significant for the primary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: 296 patients were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin and 299 to no additional carboplatin, of whom 295 and 293 started treatment, respectively. In this final analysis, 129 patients (43·7%, 95% CI 38·1-49·4) in the carboplatin group achieved a pathological complete response, compared with 108 patients (36·9%, 31·3-42·4) without carboplatin (odds ratio 1·33, 95% CI 0·96-1·85; p=0·107). Of the patients with triple-negative breast cancer, 84 (53·2%, 54·4-60·9) of 158 patients achieved a pathological complete response with carboplatin, compared with 58 (36·9%, 29·4-44·5) of 157 without (p=0·005). Of the patients with HER2-positive tumours, 45 (32·8%, 25·0-40·7) of 137 patients achieved a pathological complete response with carboplatin compared with 50 (36·8%, 28·7-44·9) of 136 without (p=0·581; test for interaction p=0·015). Haematological and non-haematological toxic effects that were significantly more common in the carboplatin group than in the no-carboplatin group included grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (192 [65%] vs 79 [27%]), grade 3 or 4 anaemia (45 [15%] vs one [<1%]), grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (42 [14%] vs one [<1%]), and grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (51 [17%] vs 32 [11%]); carboplatin was more often associated with dose discontinuations (141 [48%] with carboplatin and 114 [39%] without carboplatin; p=0·031). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 haematological events decreased from 82% (n=135) to 70% (n=92) and grade 3 or 4 non-haematological events from 78% (n=128) to 59% (n=77) in the carboplatin arm when the dose of carboplatin was reduced from AUC 2·0 to 1·5. Conclusion: The addition of neoadjuvant carboplatin to a regimen of a taxane, an anthracycline, and targeted therapy significantly increases the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response. This regimen seems to increase responses in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, but not in those with HER2-positive breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients who have residual invasive carcinoma after the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer have poor prognoses. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients remains unclear. Methods: We randomly assigned 910 patients with HER2-negative residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (containing anthracycline, taxane, or both) to receive standard postsurgical treatment either with capecitabine or without (control). The primary end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival. Results: The result of the prespecified interim analysis met the primary end point, so this trial was terminated early. The final analysis showed that disease-free survival was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (74.1% vs. 67.6% of the patients were alive and free from recurrence or second cancer at 5 years; hazard ratio for recurrence, second cancer, or death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.92; P=0.01). Overall survival was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (89.2% vs. 83.6% of the patients were alive at 5 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.90; P=0.01). Among patients with triple-negative disease, the rate of disease-free survival was 69.8% in the capecitabine group versus 56.1% in the control group (hazard ratio for recurrence, second cancer, or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87), and the overall survival rate was 78.8% versus 70.3% (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.90). The hand-foot syndrome, the most common adverse reaction to capecitabine, occurred in 73.4% of the patients in the capecitabine group. Conclusion: After standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy containing anthracycline, taxane, or both, the addition of adjuvant capecitabine therapy was safe and effective in prolonging disease-free survival and overall survival among patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who had residual invasive disease on pathological testing.

        "abstract": "Background: Neratinib, an irreversible tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of HER1, HER2, and HER4, has clinical activity in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 12 months of neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Methods: We did this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 495 centres in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America. Eligible women (aged ≥18 years, or ≥20 years in Japan) had stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer and had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy up to 2 years before randomisation. Inclusion criteria were amended on Feb 25, 2010, to include patients with stage 2-3 HER2-positive breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab therapy up to 1 year previously. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral neratinib 240 mg per day or matching placebo. The randomisation sequence was generated with permuted blocks stratified by hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive [oestrogen or progesterone receptor-positive or both] vs hormone receptor-negative [oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative]), nodal status (0, 1-3, or ≥4), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system. Patients, investigators, and trial sponsors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival, as defined in the original protocol, at 2 years after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, we randomly assigned 2840 women to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). Median follow-up time was 24 months (IQR 20-25) in the neratinib group and 24 months (22-25) in the placebo group. At 2 year follow-up, 70 invasive disease-free survival events had occurred in patients in the neratinib group versus 109 events in those in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·50-0·91; p=0·0091). The 2-year invasive disease-free survival rate was 93·9% (95% CI 92·4-95·2) in the neratinib group and 91·6% (90·0-93·0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in patients in the neratinib group were diarrhoea (grade 3, n=561 [40%] and grade 4, n=1 [<1%] vs grade 3, n=23 [2%] in the placebo group), vomiting (grade 3, n=47 [3%] vs n=5 [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3, n=26 [2%] vs n=2 [<1%]). QT prolongation occurred in 49 (3%) patients given neratinib and 93 (7%) patients given placebo, and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (≥grade 2) in 19 (1%) and 15 (1%) patients, respectively. We recorded serious adverse events in 103 (7%) patients in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) patients in the placebo group. Seven (<1%) deaths (four patients in the neratinib group and three patients in the placebo group) unrelated to disease progression occurred after study drug discontinuation. The causes of death in the neratinib group were unknown (n=2), a second primary brain tumour (n=1), and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=1), and in the placebo group were a brain haemorrhage (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and gastric cancer (n=1). None of the deaths were attributed to study treatment in either group. Conclusion: Neratinib for 12 months significantly improved 2-year invasive disease-free survival when given after chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy to women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the improvement in breast cancer outcome is maintained.",

The purpose of Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 5 was to compare the efficacy of a combination endocrine treatment with standard chemotherapy. Methods: Assessable trial subjects (N = 1,034) presenting with hormone-responsive disease were randomized to receive either 3 years of goserelin plus 5 years of tamoxifen or six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF). Stratification criteria included tumor stage and grade, number of involved nodes, type of surgery, and steroid hormone receptor content. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as time from randomization to first relapse, local recurrence, or contralateral incidence, and overall survival (OS) as time to date of death. Results: With a 60-month median follow-up, 17.2% of patients in the endocrine group and 20.8% undergoing chemotherapy developed relapses. Local recurrences emerged in 4.7% and 8.0%, respectively. RFS and local recurrence-free survival differed significantly in favor of endocrine therapy (P =.037 and P =.015), with a similar trend observed in OS (P =.195).

Methods: This phase III study investigated 913 women with untreated operable breast cancer (T2-3, N0-2, M0) randomly assigned to receive either doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 14 days for four cycles with filgrastim support (ADOC), or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 21 days followed by docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 21 days for four cycles each (AC-DOC). The primary end point was the incidence of pathologic complete (invasive and noninvasive) response (pCR) in the breast and axillary nodes. Secondary end points were predictors for pCR, clinical response, rate of breast conservation, and safety. Results: A pCR was achieved in 94 patients (10.6%), but the likelihood was significantly greater with AC-DOC (14.3%; n = 63) than with ADOC (7.0%; n = 31) (odds ratio, 2.22; 90% CI, 1.52 to 3.24; P < .001). Independent predictors of attaining a pCR included the use of sequential therapy, high tumor grade, and negative hormone receptor status. The response rates detected by palpation and by imaging were significantly higher with AC-DOC (85.0% and 78.6%, respectively) than with ADOC (75.2% and 68.6%, respectively; both P values < .001). The rate of breast-conserving surgery was 63.4% for AC-DOC and 58.1% for ADOC (P = .05). Predominant grade 3/4 toxicities were leucopenia (AC-DOC, 74.2%; ADOC, 53.7%) and neutropenia (AC-DOC, 66.4%; ADOC, 44.7%) but were infrequently associated with fever (AC-DOC, 4.6%; ADOC, 3.1%). Conclusion: Sequential AC-DOC is more effective at inducing pCR than dose-dense ADOC as preoperative treatment for patients with operable breast cancer.",

Given the demonstrated cardiac safety for trastuzumab (T) with conventionally scheduled AC followed by P, we tested the safety of dd AC followed by P with T. The primary end point was cardiac safety, and the secondary end points were time to recurrence and overall survival. Methods: Patients with HER-2/neu immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-amplified breast cancer and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >or= 55% were enrolled, regardless of tumor size or nodal status. Treatment consisted of AC (60/600 mg/m(2)) x 4 followed by P (175 mg/m(2)) x 4 every 2-weekly with pegfilgrastim (6 mg on day 2) + T x1 year. LVEF by radionuclide scan was obtained at baseline, at months 2, 6, 9, and 18. Results: From January 2005 to November 2005, 70 patients were enrolled. The median age was 49 years (range, 27 to 72 years); median LVEF at baseline was 68% (range, 55% to 81%).

We report cardiac safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer. Methods: BERENICE ( ) is a nonrandomized, phase II, open-label, multicenter, multinational study in patients with normal cardiac function. In the neoadjuvant period, cohort A patients received four cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, then 12 doses of standard paclitaxel plus four standard trastuzumab and pertuzumab cycles. Cohort B patients received four standard fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide cycles, then four docetaxel cycles with four standard trastuzumab and pertuzumab cycles. The primary end point was cardiac safety during neoadjuvant treatment, assessed by the incidence of New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure and of left ventricular ejection fraction declines (≥10 percentage-points from baseline and to a value of <50%). The main efficacy end point was pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0/is ypN0). Results are descriptive. Results: Safety populations were 199 and 198 patients in cohorts A and B, respectively. Three patients [1.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31% to 4.34%] in cohort A experienced four New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure events. Thirteen patients (6.5%; 95% CI 3.5% to 10.9%) in cohort A and four (2.0%; 95% CI 0.6% to 5.1%) in cohort B experienced at least one left ventricular ejection fraction decline. No new safety signals were identified. pCR rates were 61.8% and 60.7% in cohorts A and B, respectively. The highest pCR rates were in the HER2-enriched PAM50 subtype (75.0% and 73.7%, respectively). Conclusion: Treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and common anthracycline-containing regimens for the neoadjuvant treatment of early breast cancer resulted in cardiac and general safety profiles, and pCR rates, consistent with prior studies with pertuzumab.",

Aim of the NeoSTOP multisite randomized phase II trial was to assess efficacy of anthracycline-free and anthracycline-containing neoadjuvant carboplatin regimens. Methods: Patients aged ≥18 years with stage I-III TNBC were randomized (1:1) to receive either paclitaxel (P) weekly × 12 plus carboplatin AUC6 every 21 days × 4 followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) every 14 days × 4 (CbP → AC, arm A), or carboplatin AUC6 + docetaxel (D) every 21 days × 6 (CbD, arm B). Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL) were assessed. Primary endpoint was pCR in breast and axilla. Other endpoints included residual cancer burden (RCB), toxicity, cost, and event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: One hundred patients were randomized; arm A (  = 48) or arm B (  = 52). pCR was 54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40%-69%] in arm A and 54% (95% CI, 40%-68%) in arm B. RCB 0+I rate was 67% in both arms. Median sTIL density was numerically higher in those with pCR compared with those with residual disease (20% vs. 5%;   = 0.25). At median follow-up of 38 months, EFS and OS were similar in the two arms. Grade 3/4 adverse events were more common in arm A compared with arm B, with the most notable differences in neutropenia (60% vs. 8%;   < 0.001) and febrile neutropenia (19% vs. 0%;   < 0.001). There was one treatment-related death (arm A) due to acute leukemia. Mean treatment cost was lower for arm B compared with arm A (  = 0.02). Conclusion: The two-drug CbD regimen yielded pCR, RCB 0+I, and survival rates similar to the four-drug regimen of CbP → AC, but with a more favorable toxicity profile and lower treatment-associated cost.",

        "abstract": "Background: We have shown that testosterone (T) deficiency per se is associated with marked catabolic effects on protein, calcium metabolism, and body composition in men independent of changes in GH or insulin-like growth factor I production. It is not clear,,however, whether estrogens have a major role in whole body anabolism in males. We investigated the metabolic effects of selective estrogen suppression in the male using a potent aromatase inhibitor, Arimidex (Anastrozole). First, a dose-response study of 12 males (mean age, 16.1 +/- 0.3 yr) was conducted, and blood withdrawn at baseline and after 10 days of oral Arimidex given as two different doses (either 0.5 or 1 mg) in random order with a 14-day washout in between. A sensitive estradiol (E2) assay showed an approximately 50% decrease in E2 concentrations with either of the two doses; hence, a 1-mg dose was selected for other studies. Subsequently, eight males (aged 15-22 yr; four adults and four late pubertal) had isotopic infusions of [(13)C]leucine and (42)Ca/(44)Ca, indirect calorimetry, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, isokinetic dynamometry, and growth factors measurements performed before and after 10 weeks of daily doses of Arimidex. Contrary to the effects of T withdrawal, there were no significant changes in body composition (body mass index, fat mass, and fat-free mass) after estrogen suppression or in rates of protein synthesis or degradation; carbohydrate, lipid, or protein oxidation; muscle strength; calcium kinetics; or bone growth factors concentrations. However, E2 concentrations decreased 48% (P = 0.006), with no significant change in mean and peak GH concentrations, but with an 18% decrease in plasma insulin-like growth factor I concentrations. There was a 58% increase in serum T (P = 0.0001), sex hormone-binding globulin did not change, whereas LH and FSH concentrations increased (P < 0.02, both). Serum bone markers, osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and rates of bone calcium deposition and resorption did not change. In conclusion, these data suggest that in the male 1) estrogens do not contribute significantly to the changes in body composition and protein synthesis observed with changing androgen levels; 2) estrogen is a main regulator of the gonadal-pituitary feedback for the gonadotropin axis; and 3) this level of aromatase inhibition does not negatively impact either kinetically measured rates of bone calcium turnover or indirect markers of bone calcium turnover, at least in the short term. Further studies will provide valuable information on whether timed aromatase inhibition can be useful in increasing the height potential of pubertal boys with profound growth retardation without the confounding negative effects of gonadal androgen suppression.",

        "abstract": "Background: To analyze the stage-specific management of male breast cancer (MBC) with surgery and radiation therapy (RT) and relate them to outcomes and to female breast cancer (FBC). Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for all primary invasive MBC and FBC diagnosed from 1973 to 2008. Analyzable data included age, race, registry, grade, stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, type of surgery, and use of RT. Stage was defined as localized (LocD): confined to the breast; regional (RegD): involving skin, chest wall, and/or regional lymph nodes; and distant: M1. The primary endpoint was cause-specific survival (CSS). Results: A total of 4276 cases of MBC and 718,587 cases of FBC were identified. Male breast cancer constituted 0.6% of all breast cancer. Comparing MBC with FBC, mastectomy (M) was used in 87.4% versus 38.3%, and breast-conserving surgery in 12.6% versus 52.6% (P<10(-4)). For males with LocD, CSS was not significantly different for the 4.6% treated with lumpectomy/RT versus the 70% treated with M alone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-3.61; P=.57). Postmastectomy RT was delivered in 33% of males with RegD and was not associated with an improvement in CSS (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.88-1.41; P=.37). There was a significant increase in the use of postmastectomy RT in MBC over time: 24.3%, 27.2%, and 36.8% for 1973-1987, 1988-1997, and 1998-2008, respectively (P<.0001). Cause-specific survival for MBC has improved: the largest significant change was identified for men diagnosed in 1998-2008 compared with 1973-1987 (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; P=.0004). Conclusion: Surgical management of MBC is dramatically different than for FBC. The majority of males with LocD receive M despite equivalent CSS with lumpectomy/RT. Postmastectomy RT is greatly underutilized in MBC with RegD, although a CSS benefit was not demonstrated. Outcomes for MBC are improving, attributable to improved therapy and its use in this unscreened population.",

Methods: We evaluated men and women with breast cancer between 2010 and 2013 with known hormone receptor (HR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status reported to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Patient characteristics were compared between groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the effect of each variable on OS. Breast cancer-specific survival was a secondary endpoint. Results: We included 1187 MBC and 166,054 FBC. Median follow-up was 21 months (range, 1 to 48) for both groups. OS at 3 years for MBC and FBC was 85.6% and 90.4%, respectively (P=0.0002). MBC were more ductal, had higher grade, presented with more advanced stage and were often HR+/HER2- (each P<0.0001). MBC had worse OS than FBC in HR+/HER2- (Hazard ratio [HaR], 1.5; P=0.0005), HR+/HER2+ (HaR, 2.8; P<0.0001) and triple negative (HaR, 4.3; P<0.0001) (Pinteraction<0.02). MBC had significantly worse OS than FBC in stages I and II, but similar OS in stages III and IV (Pinteraction<0.01). In multivariate analysis, HR+/HER2+ was the only subtype with significant differences in OS between MBC and FBC (HaR, 2.0; P=0.002). Conclusion: OS was significantly different in both groups. Men had worse OS in early stages while similar OS in stages III and IV. There were significant differences in OS according to tumor subtype; compared with women, men with HR+/HER2+ tumors had twice the risk of death.",

        "abstract": "Background: The preponderance of evidence states that, in adult men, estradiol (E2) inhibits LH secretion by decreasing pulse amplitude and responsiveness to GnRH consistent with a pituitary site of action. However, this conclusion is based on studies that employed pharmacologic doses of sex steroids, used nonselective aromatase inhibitors, and/or were performed in normal (NL) men, a model in which endogenous counterregulatory adaptations to physiologic perturbations confound interpretation of the results. In addition, studies in which estrogen antagonists were administered to NL men demonstrated an increase in LH pulse frequency, suggesting a potential additional hypothalamic site of E2 feedback. To reconcile these conflicting data, we used a selective aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, to examine the impact of E2 suppression on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in the male. Parallel studies of NL men and men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), whose pituitary-gonadal axis had been normalized with long-term GnRH therapy, were performed to permit precise localization of the site of E2 feedback. In this so-called tandem model, a hypothalamic site of action of sex steroids can thus be inferred whenever there is a difference in the gonadotropin responses of NL and IHH men to alterations in their sex steroid milieu. A selective GnRH antagonist was also used to provide a semiquantitative estimate of endogenous GnRH secretion before and after E2 suppression. Fourteen NL men and seven IHH men were studied. In Exp 1, nine NL and seven IHH men received anastrozole (10 mg/day po x 7 days). Blood samples were drawn daily between 0800 and 1000 h in the NL men and immediately before a GnRH bolus dose in the IHH men. In Exp 2, blood was drawn (every 10 min x 12 h) from nine NL men at baseline and on day 7 of anastrozole. In a subset of five NL men, 5 microg/kg of the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist was administered on completion of frequent blood sampling, then sampling continued every 20 min for a further 8 h. Anastrozole suppressed E2 equivalently in the NL (136 +/- 10 to 52 +/-2 pmol/L, P < 0.005) and IHH men (118 +/- 23 to 60 +/- 5 pmol/L, P < 0.005). Testosterone levels rose significantly (P < 0.005), with a mean increase of 53 +/- 6% in NL vs. 56 +/- 7% in IHH men. Despite these similar changes in sex steroids, the increase in gonadotropins was greater in NL than in IHH men (100 +/- 9 vs. 58 +/- 6% for LH, P = 0.07; and 85 +/- 6 vs. 41 +/- 4% for FSH, P < 0.002). Frequent sampling studies in the NL men demonstrated that this rise in mean LH levels, after aromatase blockade, reflected an increase in both LH pulse frequency (10.2 +/- 0.9 to 14.0 +/- 1.0 pulses/24 h, P < 0.05) and pulse amplitude (5.7 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 0.7 IU/L, P < 0.001). Percent LH inhibition after acute GnRH receptor blockade was similar at baseline and after E2 suppression (69.2 +/- 2.4 vs. 70 +/- 1.9%), suggesting that there was no change in the quantity of endogenous GnRH secreted. From these data, we conclude that in the human male, estrogen has dual sites of negative feedback, acting at the hypothalamus to decrease GnRH pulse frequency and at the pituitary to decrease responsiveness to GnRH.",

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose Limited data exist on the molecular biology, treatment, and outcomes of breast cancer in men, and much of our understanding in this area remains largely an extrapolation from data in women with breast cancer. Materials and Methods We studied men and women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and the 21-gene Breast Recurrence Score (RS) results. Differences in clinical characteristics and gene expression were determined, and distribution of RS results was correlated with 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival. Results There were 3,806 men and 571,115 women. Men were older than women (mean age, 64.2 v 59.1 years; P < .001). RS < 18 predominated in both genders, but RS ≥ 31 was more frequent in men (12.4% v 7.4%; P < .001), as were very low scores (RS < 11; 33.8% v 22.1%; P < .001). Mean gene expression was higher in men for the estrogen receptor (ER), proliferation, and invasion groups. ER was lowest and progesterone receptor was highest in women younger than 50 years of age, with a progressive increase in ER with age. Men younger than 50 years of age had slightly lower ER and progesterone receptor compared with older men. Survival data were available from SEER for 322 men and 55,842 women. Five-year BCSS was 99.0% (95% CI, 99.3% to 99.9%) and 95.9% (95% CI, 87.6% to 98.7%) for men with RS < 18 and RS 18-30, respectively, and for women, it was 99.5% (95% CI, 99.4% to 99.6%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 98.4% to 98.8%), respectively. RS ≥ 31 was associated with an 81.0% 5-year BCSS in men (95% CI, 53.3% to 93.2%) and 94.9% 5-year BCSS (95% CI, 93.9% to 95.7%) in women. Five-year BCSS and overall survival were lower in men than in women. Conclusion This study reveals some distinctive biologic features of breast cancer in men and an important prognostic role for RS testing in both men and women.",

Negative SLNs were found in 39 of 76 (51%) patients. In 3 (8%) patients with negative SLNs, a positive non-SLN was found, identified by intraoperative palpation. Positive SLNs were found in 37 of 76 (49%) patients. In 22 of 37 (59%), node positivity was determined intraoperatively, prompting immediate ALND. In 15 of 37 (41%) patients with positive SLNs, node positivity was determined postoperatively. Of these 15, 9 (60%) underwent completion ALND. In the 2 of 78 (3%) patients with failed SLN biopsy procedures, ALND was performed and yielded positive nodes. At a median followup of 28 months (range 5 to 96 months), there were no axillary recurrences. Compared with their female counterparts, men with breast cancer had larger tumors and were more likely to have positive nodes. Conclusion: SLN biopsy is successful and accurate in male breast cancer patients. Although a larger proportion of men have positive nodes, for men with negative nodes, SLN biopsy may reduce morbidity related to ALND.",

        "abstract": "Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy, and gender-specific treatment outcomes are currently lacking. The use of a large, multi-national surgical-outcomes database may provide a better understanding of treatment patterns and postoperative morbidity in men who undergo oncological breast surgery. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between 2007 and 2016 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (NSQIP), examining MBC treatment patterns and postoperative complication rates. All men undergoing surgery for the treatment of invasive or in situ carcinoma of the breast were identified. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and surgical treatment options most frequently used for this population were described. In addition, the 30-day postoperative complication rates in the surgical treatment of male breast cancer were evaluated. Results: A total of 1773 MBC patients with a median age of 65 years (IQR 56-74 years) were included in this analysis. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.1 (IQR 25.4-33.8). In this study population, 177 (10.0%) had a diagnosis of in situ breast cancer, while the remaining 1596 (90.0%) had invasive disease. While most men underwent mastectomy, 282 (15.9%) had breast-conserving surgery. There were 74 (4.2%) patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In addition, 118 (6.7%) patients elected to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Overall, the rate of morbidity was 4.6%, comprising mostly of wound complications (3.2%). Conclusion: Analysis of this large, prospective multi-institutional cohort revealed that complication rates are low and comparable to reported rates in the female breast cancer population. What is also significant about this analysis is that the cohort demonstrated the importance of cosmetic considerations in MBC patients, as some men decide to undergo breast-conserving surgery or immediate breast reconstruction. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in the treatment of MBC is also performed.",

        "abstract": "Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and lacks data-based treatment guidelines. Most men are currently treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or simple mastectomy (SM). We compared the oncologic treatment outcomes of early-stage MBC to determine whether breast conservation therapy (BCT) is appropriate. Methods: We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for MBC cases. That cohort was narrowed to cases of stage I-II, T1-T2N0 MBC with surgical and radiation therapy (RT) data available. The patients had undergone MRM, SM, or breast conservation surgery (BCS) with or without postoperative RT. We calculated the actuarial 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS). Results: We identified 6263 MBC cases and included 1777 men with stage I or II, T1-T2, node-negative disease, who had the required treatment information available. MRM without RT was the most common treatment (43%). Only 17% underwent BCS. Of the BCS patients, 46% received adjuvant RT to complete the traditional BCT. No deaths were recorded in the BCT group, regardless of stage, or in the 3 stage I surgical groups if the men had received RT. The actuarial 5-year CSS was 100% in each BCT group. MRM alone resulted in an actuarial 5-year CSS of 97.3% for stage 1% and 91.2% for stage 2. Conclusion: The results from our study suggest that BCT for early-stage MBC yields comparable survival compared with more invasive treatment modalities (ie, MRM or SM alone). This could shift the treatment paradigm to less-invasive interventions and might have the added benefit of increased functional and psychological outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our conclusions.",

We report the results of part I, a retrospective joint analysis of cases diagnosed during a 20-year period. Methods: Patients with follow-up and tumor samples, treated between 1990 and 2010, in 93 centers/9 countries. Samples were centrally analyzed in three laboratories (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States). Results: Of 1822 patients enrolled, 1483 were analyzed; 63.5% were diagnosed between 2001 and 2010, 57 (5.1%) had metastatic disease (M1). Median age at diagnosis: 68.4 years. Of 1054 M0 cases, 56.2% were node-negative (N0) and 48.5% had T1 tumors; 4% had breast conserving surgery (BCS), 18% sentinel lymph-node biopsy; half received adjuvant radiotherapy; 29.8% (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and 76.8% adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), mostly tamoxifen (88.4%). Per central pathology, for M0 tumors: 84.8% ductal invasive carcinomas, 51.5% grade 2; 99.3% estrogen receptor (ER)-positive; 81.9% progesterone receptor (PR)-positive; 96.9% androgen receptor (AR)-positive [ER, PR or AR Allred score ≥3]; 61.1% Ki67 expression low (<14% positive cells); using immunohistochemistry (IHC) surrogates, 41.9% were Luminal-A-like, 48.6% Luminal-B-like/HER-2-negative, 8.7% HER-2-positive, 0.3% triple negative. Median follow-up: 8.2 years (0.0-23.8) for all, 7.2 years (0.0-23.2), for M0, 2.6 years (0.0-12.7) for M1 patients. A significant improvement over time was observed in age-corrected BC mortality. BC-specific-mortality was higher for men younger than 50 years. Better overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were observed for highly ER+ (P = 0.001), highly PR+ (P = 0.002), highly AR+ disease (P = 0.019). There was no association between OS/RFS and HER-2 status, Ki67, IHC subtypes nor grade. Conclusion: Male BC is usually ER, PR and AR-positive, Luminal B-like/HER2-negative. Of note, 56% patients had T1 tumors but only 4% had BCS. ER was highly positive in >90% of cases but only 77% received adjuvant ET. ER, PR and AR were associated with OS and RFS, whereas grade, Ki67 and IHC surrogates were not. Significant improvement in survival over time was observed.",

Some extrapolate the results from female breast cancer trials, while others advocate systematic adjuvant irradiation. We evaluated clinical practices and outcomes with respect to radiation therapy in MBC treated with locoregional irradiation in the adjuvant setting using a systematic literature review. Methods: We included studies with data about adjuvant radiotherapy published between 1984 and 2017 and including at least 40 patients. Results: We found 29 retrospective series, 10,065 men were diagnosed with breast cancer; 3-100% (mean=54%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. Tumor size and nodal involvement were the strongest prognostic factors. Approximatively half of all cases had nodal metastases. Radiation therapy improved locoregional control in six series, overall survival in three and distant metastasis-free survival in one. Conclusion: MBC is diagnosed at a highly advanced stage and may be linked with poorer outcomes. Adjuvant radiation therapy must, at least, be proposed to men with positive nodes. Despite the large number of cases gathered here, arguments for radiotherapy in other prognostic subgroups (especially in pN0) may exist but are not well supported.",

        "abstract": "Background: Current treatment guidelines for male breast cancer are predominantly guided by female-only clinical trials. With scarce research, it is unclear whether breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is equivalent to mastectomy in men. We sought to compare overall survival (OS) among male breast cancer patients who underwent BCT versus mastectomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 8445 stage I-II (T1-2 N0-1 M0) male breast cancer patients from the National Cancer Database (2004-2014). Patients were grouped according to surgical and radiation therapy (RT). BCT was defined as partial mastectomy followed by RT. Multivariable and inverse probability of treatment-weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare OS between treatment groups, controlling for demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics. Results: Most patients underwent total mastectomy (61.2%), whereas 18.2% underwent BCT, 12.4% underwent total mastectomy with RT, and 8.2% underwent partial mastectomy alone. In multivariable and IPTW models, partial mastectomy alone, total mastectomy alone, and total mastectomy with RT were associated with worse OS compared with BCT (p < 0.001 all). Ten-year OS was 73.8% for BCT and 56.3, 58.0 and 56.3% for other treatment approaches. Older age, higher T/N stage, histological grade, and triple-negative receptor status were associated with poorer OS (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis by stage demonstrated similar results. Conclusion: In this national sample of male breast cancer patients, BCT was associated with greater survival. The underlying mechanisms of this association warrant further study, because more routine adoption of BCT in male breast cancer appears to translate into clinically meaningful improvements in survival.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer in men is rare, so clinical trials are not practical. Recommendations suggest treating men who are diagnosed with breast cancer using the guidelines for postmenopausal women; however, to date, no population-based studies have evaluated patterns of care. Methods: To examine characteristics, treatment, and survival among men with newly diagnosed breast cancer, in 2003 and 2004, 512 men were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Data were reabstracted and therapy was verified through the patients' treating physicians. Results: The majority of men (79%) were diagnosed through discovery of a breast lump or other signs/symptoms. Among men who had invasive disease, 86% underwent mastectomy, 37% received chemotherapy, and 58% received hormone therapy. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (P=.01) and positive lymph node status (P<.0001) were associated positively with the use of chemotherapy, whereas age group (P<.0001) and current unmarried status (P=.01) had negative associations. Among men who had invasive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/borderline tumors, the use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) was associated with age group (P=.05). Among men who had invasive disease, cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P<.0001). Among men with ER-positive/borderline disease, increased cancer mortality was associated with tumor size (P<.0001), current unmarried status (P=.04), and decreased mortality with tamoxifen (P=.04). Conclusion: Tumor characteristics and marital status were the primary predictors of therapy and cancer mortality among men with breast cancer. Although AIs are not currently recommended, they are commonly prescribed. However, their use did not result in a decrease in cancer mortality. Research must examine the efficacy of AIs with and without gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues.",

There may be a potential role in selective screening in men at elevated risk for breast cancer, but the effectiveness of such screening remains unexplored. Purpose To evaluate patterns of male breast imaging utilization, to determine high-risk screening outcomes, and to delineate risk factors associated with cancer diagnosis. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed consecutive male breast imaging examinations over a 12-year period (between 2005-2017). Examination indications, biopsy recommendations, and pathologic results were correlated with patient characteristics. Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 1869 men (median age, 55 years; range, 18-96 years) underwent 2052 examinations yielding 2304 breast lesions and resulting in 149 (6.5%) biopsies in 133 men; 41 (27.5%) were malignant and 108 (72.5%) were benign. There were 1781 (86.8%) diagnostic and 271 (13.2%) screening examinations. All men undergoing screening had personal or family history of breast cancer and/or genetic mutations. There was a significant increase in the number of examinations in men relative to the number of examinations in women over time (Spearman correlation,   = 0.85;   < .001). Five node-negative cancers resulted from screening mammography, yielding a cancer detection rate of 18 per 1000 examinations (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7, 41), with cancers diagnosed on average after 4 person-years of screening (range, 1-10 person-years). Mammographic screening sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of biopsy were 100% (95% CI: 50%, 100%), 95.0% (95% CI: 93.1%, 98%), and 50% (95% CI: 22.2%, 77.8%). Older age (  < .001), Ashkenazi descent (  < .001), genetic mutations (  = .006), personal history (  < .001), and first-degree family history (  = .03) were associated with breast cancer. Non-first-degree family history was not associated with cancer (  = .09). Conclusion There is potential benefit in screening men at high risk for developing breast cancer.

        "abstract": "Background: Although mastectomy is considered the gold standard for male breast cancer (MBC), the utilization of lumpectomy and its impact on outcomes in MBC patients has not been previously studied. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify all MBC patients who underwent either mastectomy or less than mastectomy (i.e., lumpectomy) between 1983 and 2009. Results: A total of 4707 (86.8 %) men underwent mastectomy and 718 (13.2 %) underwent lumpectomy. A greater proportion of patients underwent lumpectomy later in the study period (1983 to 1986, 10.6 %, vs. 2007 to 2009, 15.1 %). A greater percentage of lumpectomy patients were 80 years or older (21.3 % vs. 16.3 %), had stage IV disease (7.3 % vs. 3.1 %), and received no lymph node sampling (34.3 % vs. 6.9 %). Only 35.4 % of patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy. Ten-year breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival were 82.8 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in lumpectomy patients vs. 77.3 % and 46.4 %, respectively, in mastectomy patients. On Cox proportional hazards regression, lumpectomy was not independently associated with worse breast cancer-specific survival (odds ratio 1.09, 95 % confidence interval 0.87-1.37) or overall survival (odds ratio 1.12, 95 % confidence interval 0.98-1.27) after controlling for age, race, stage, and grade, as well as whether radiotherapy was received. Conclusion: Lumpectomy is performed in a small but growing proportion of MBC patients. These patients are not only older and more likely to have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, but they also are less likely to receive standard of care therapy, such as lymph node sampling and adjuvant radiotherapy. Despite these observations, breast cancer-specific survival is unaffected by the type of surgery.",

Methods: Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) or doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for a maximum of seven treatment cycles. Results: A total of 326 patients were randomized, 165 to receive doxorubicin and 161 to receive docetaxel. Overall, docetaxel produced a significantly higher rate of objective response than did doxorubicin (47.8% v 33.3%; P =.008). Docetaxel was also significantly more active than doxorubicin in patients with negative prognostic factors, such as visceral metastases (objective response, 46% v 29%) and resistance to prior chemotherapy (47% v 25%). Median time to progression was longer in the docetaxel group (26 weeks v 21 weeks; difference not significant). Median overall survival was similar in the two groups (docetaxel, 15 months; doxorubicin, 14 months). There was one death due to infection in each group, and an additional four deaths due to cardiotoxicity in the doxorubicin group. Although neutropenia was similar in both groups, febrile neutropenia and severe infection occurred more frequently in the doxorubicin group. For severe nonhematologic toxicity, the incidences of cardiac toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis were higher among patients receiving doxorubicin, whereas diarrhea, neuropathy, fluid retention, and skin and nail changes were higher among patients receiving docetaxel. Conclusion: The observed differences in activity and toxicity profiles provide a basis for therapy choice and confirms the rationale for combination studies in early breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Anthracyclines and taxanes have historically constituted the backbone of chemotherapy regimens for patients with breast cancer positive for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). For a subset of patients who categorically refuse alopecia, or for those with a contraindication to those drugs, there is an urgent need to define alternative regimens. Here, we report our institutional experience with trastuzumab and vinorelbine (tv), a combination with good clinical activity and a good side effect profile for patients with her2-positive breast cancer. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, outcomes data were extracted for patients receiving tv as their only chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting at the Jewish General Hospital. For the most part, tv was administered weekly for 6 months, followed by trastuzumab for 6 months. Results: The analysis identified 46 patients (mean age: 64 years) who received tv between 2003 and 2012 (n = 36 adjuvant, n = 10 neoadjuvant). Of the patients in the adjuvant group, 81% had stage i disease. In the neoadjuvant group, 3 patients experienced a complete pathologic response. Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence after a short course (3 months) of adjuvant tv. Overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival were 94% and 98% respectively at a median 5 years of follow-up. Febrile neutropenia-induced sepsis resulted in the death of 1 patient with significant medical comorbidities; 2 other patients died of comorbidities unrelated to their cancer or treatment. Grades 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (23%), febrile neutropenia (10%), fatigue (2%), and anemia (2%). Conclusion: For patients with non-metastatic breast cancer refusing alopecia, or for patients who are not candidates for standard chemotherapy, tv is a reasonable alternative to standard adjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Treatments with survival benefit are greatly needed for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Eribulin mesilate is a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mode of action. We aimed to compare overall survival of heavily pretreated patients receiving eribulin versus currently available treatments. Methods: In this phase 3 open-label study, women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were randomly allocated (2:1) to eribulin mesilate (1·4 mg/m(2) administered intravenously during 2-5 min on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or treatment of physician's choice (TPC). Patients had received between two and five previous chemotherapy regimens (two or more for advanced disease), including an anthracycline and a taxane, unless contraindicated. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, previous capecitabine treatment, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: 762 women were randomly allocated to treatment groups (508 eribulin, 254 TPC). Overall survival was significantly improved in women assigned to eribulin (median 13·1 months, 95% CI 11·8-14·3) compared with TPC (10·6 months, 9·3-12·5; hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·66-0·99; p=0·041). The most common adverse events in both groups were asthenia or fatigue (270 [54%] of 503 patients on eribulin and 98 [40%] of 247 patients on TPC at all grades) and neutropenia (260 [52%] patients receiving eribulin and 73 [30%] of those on TPC at all grades). Peripheral neuropathy was the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation from eribulin, occurring in 24 (5%) of 503 patients. Conclusion: Eribulin showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared with TPC in women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. This finding challenges the notion that improved overall survival is an unrealistic expectation during evaluation of new anticancer therapies in the refractory setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: The identification of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who are expected to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy is of interest. We conducted a single-arm phase II clinical trial of single-agent platinum for mTNBC with biomarker correlates. Methods: Patients with mTNBC received first- or second-line cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve 6) by physician's choice once every 3 weeks. Coprimary end points were objective response rate (RR) and response prediction by p63/p73 gene expression. Secondary and exploratory end points included toxicity assessment, RR in cisplatin versus carboplatin, and RR in molecularly defined subgroups, including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Results: Patients (N = 86; 69 as first-line therapy) received cisplatin (n = 43) or carboplatin (n = 43). RR was 25.6% (95% CI, 16.8% to 36%) and was numerically higher with cisplatin (32.6%) than with carboplatin (18.7%). RR was 54.5% in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 11). In patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 66), exploratory analyses showed that a BRCA-like genomic instability signature (n = 32) discriminated responding and nonresponding tumors (mean homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity/homologous recombination deficiency-large-scale state transitions [HRD-LOH/HRD-LST] scores were 12.68 and 5.11, respectively), whereas predefined analysis by p63/p73 expression status (n = 61), p53 and PIK3CA mutation status (n = 53), or PAM50 gene expression subtype (n = 55) did not. Five of the six long-term responders alive at a median of 4.5 years lacked germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and two of them had increased tumor HRD-LOH/HRD-LST scores. Conclusion: Platinum agents are active in mTNBC, especially in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. A measure of tumor DNA repair function may identify patients without mutations who could benefit from platinum therapy agents. Prospective controlled confirmatory trials are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Background: PURPOSE Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent not used routinely for breast cancer treatment. As a DNA cross-linking agent, cisplatin may be effective treatment for hereditary BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. Because sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA1-associated breast cancer share features suggesting common pathogenesis, we conducted a neoadjuvant trial of cisplatin in TNBC and explored specific biomarkers to identify predictors of response. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-eight women with stage II or III breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2/Neu (TNBC) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with BRCA1 germline mutations;18 (64%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14%) progressed. All TNBCs clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low BRCA1 mRNA expression (P = .03), BRCA1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). CONCLUSION Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with TNBC. Decreased BRCA1 expression may identify subsets of TNBCs that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response.",

        "abstract": "Background: Until recently, there has been no standard treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed an anthracycline-containing regimen, and no definitive phase III trials had been conducted in this setting. The results of three randomized phase III clinical trials of single-agent docetaxel (Taxotere, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA) 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in comparison to combination chemotherapy regimens in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen are reviewed and reported. An overall response rate of between 30% and 42% was reported for single-agent docetaxel, which was higher in comparison to response rates attained with the combination chemotherapy regimens in all three trials. Noteworthy were findings of a significantly improved overall survival for docetaxel-treated patients in one of the comparative trials. These results firmly establish docetaxel as preferred therapy over combination chemotherapy regimens with mitomycin C plus vinblastine, methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil, or 5-fluorouracil plus vinorelbine in the therapy of anthracycline-resistant and/or anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients. The results document the continued high level of docetaxel antitumor activity in previously anthracycline-exposed patients initially reported in phase II trials and confirm a substantial lack of anthracycline cross-resistance. The higher response rate of single-agent docetaxel versus single-agent doxorubicin as demonstrated in a fourth randomized phase III trial gives credence to the presumption that the combination of these two agents may provide a highly effective chemotherapy regimen in the management of breast cancer patients.",

Methods: Patients whose cancer had progressed after one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced breast cancer or had recurred during or within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to docetaxel 60, 75, or 100 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Results: Five hundred twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned (intent to treat [ITT]), and 524 were assessable for toxicity. In the population assessable for efficacy (n = 407), logistic regression analysis showed that increasing docetaxel dose was significantly associated with higher response rate (P = .007) and improved time to progression (TTP; P = .014). In the ITT analysis, a significant dose-response relationship was observed for tumor response (P = .026) but not for TTP (P = .067). The incidences of most hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were related to increasing dose, with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurring in 76.4%, 83.7%, and 93.4% and febrile neutropenia occurring in 4.7%, 7.4%, and 14.1% of patients administered the 60, 75, and 100 mg/m2 doses, respectively. One death was considered treatment related. Conclusion: A relationship between increasing dose of docetaxel and increased tumor response was observed across the dose range of 60 to 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Toxicities were related to increasing dose. Depending on the therapy goal, any of the doses studied may be appropriate for second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.",

Methods: A phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in patients with MBC who were treated with docetaxel either every 3 weeks or once weekly to determine and compare response rate and duration, time to disease progression, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel at a starting dose of either 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or 35 mg/m(2) weekly for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Results: A total of 118 patients underwent efficacy analysis; 59 patients were randomized to the every-3-week treatment arm and 59 to the weekly arm. The response rate was 35.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 23.6-49.1%) for the every-3-week arm versus 20.3% (95% CI, 11.0-32.8%) for the weekly arm.

This phase III study was performed to confirm preclinical studies demonstrating superior efficacy and reduced toxicity of ABI-007 compared with standard paclitaxel. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to 3-week cycles of either ABI-007 260 mg/m(2) intravenously without premedication (n = 229) or standard paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) intravenously with premedication (n = 225). Results: ABI-007 demonstrated significantly higher response rates compared with standard paclitaxel (33% v 19%, respectively; P = .001) and significantly longer time to tumor progression (23.0 v 16.9 weeks, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.75; P = .006). The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia was significantly lower for ABI-007 compared with standard paclitaxel (9% v 22%, respectively; P < .001) despite a 49% higher paclitaxel dose. Febrile neutropenia was uncommon (< 2%), and the incidence did not differ between the two study arms. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was more common in the ABI-007 arm than in the standard paclitaxel arm (10% v 2%, respectively; P < .001) but was easily managed and improved rapidly (median, 22 days). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred with ABI-007 despite the absence of premedication and shorter administration time. Conclusion: ABI-007 demonstrated greater efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared with standard paclitaxel in this patient population. The improved therapeutic index and elimination of corticosteroid premedication required for solvent-based taxanes make the novel albumin-bound paclitaxel ABI-007 an important advance in the treatment of MBC.",

This phase II study examined the antitumor activity and safety of weekly and every 3 week (q3w) nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel as first-line treatment in patients with MBC. Methods: In this randomized, multicenter study, patients (N = 302) with previously untreated MBC received nab-paclitaxel 300 mg/m(2) q3w, 100 mg/m(2) weekly, or 150 mg/m(2) weekly or docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w. Results: nab-Paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) weekly demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than docetaxel by both independent radiologist assessment (12.9 v 7.5 months, respectively; P = .0065) and investigator assessment (14.6 v 7.8 months, respectively; P = .012). On the basis of independent radiologist review, both 150 mg/m(2) (49%) and 100 mg/m(2) (45%) weekly of nab-paclitaxel demonstrated a higher overall response rate (ORR) than docetaxel (35%), but this did not reach statistical significance. This trend was supported by statistically significant investigator ORR for both weekly nab-paclitaxel doses versus docetaxel. nab-Paclitaxel q3w versus docetaxel was not different for PFS or ORR. On the basis of both the independent radiologist and investigator review, disease control rate was significantly higher for patients receiving either dose of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel. Grade 3 or 4 fatigue, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia were less frequent in all nab-paclitaxel arms. The frequency and grade of peripheral neuropathy were similar in all arms. Conclusion: This randomized study in first-line MBC demonstrated superior efficacy and safety of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel, with a statistically and clinically significant prolongation of PFS (> 5 months) in patients receiving nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) weekly compared with docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w.",

Of 43 evaluable patients 36% (eight of 22) treated with Epi and 38% (eight of 21) treated with Dox achieved a complete plus partial response rate (95% confidence limits 16-56% +/- 20% and 18-58% +/- 20%, respectively). Patients who obtained a major therapeutic response to previous CMF exhibited a significantly higher response rate with both the drugs: seven of eight (87.5%) compared with one of 13 (8%); p less than 0.05 for Epi and six of seven (86%) compared with two of 15 (13%); p less than 0.05 for Dox. The median duration of response was 4.5 months with Epi compared with 7 months with Dox, and the median survival of the two groups of patients were superimposable (12 months with Epi versus 11 months with Dox). The median cumulative dose was 220 mg/m2 (range 160-620) and 240 mg/m2 (range 160-860) for Epi and Dox, respectively. Gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities were moderate for both the drugs, with fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, and leukopenia following Epi administration. A very low incidence of alopecia was recorded for both the drugs. Regarding cardiac evaluation, no significant differences were evident; however, the only case that developed symptomatic congestive heart failure was in the Dox arm, after a cumulative dose of 820 mg/m2 at 11.5 months. Epi given weekly at low doses preserves efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer, and given at equimolar doses, has a slightly better therapeutic index than the parent compound.",

The study also included analysis of a correlation between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Methods: Two hundred eighty-seven women were randomized to receive either 40, 60, 90, or 135 mg/m2 of epirubicin intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Treatment consisted of first-line cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease. In patients with early progressive disease after either 40 or 60 mg/m2, dose escalation to 135 mg/m2 was performed. A full pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 78 patients. Results: Among 263 eligible patients, an increase in response rate and time to progression was found with an increase in dose from 40 to 90 mg/m2, while no increase in efficacy was found from 90 to 135 mg/m2. Multivariate analysis, using the Cox proportional hazards model with time to progression as the end point, confirmed that epirubicin dose more than 60 mg/m2 was an independent prognostic covariate. Furthermore, a significant association was established between randomized dose and both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. No association between pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy parameters was demonstrated. On the other hand, a significant correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity was found. Conclusion: An increase in dose of epirubicin from 40 to 90 mg/m2 is accompanied by increased efficacy. Further increases in dose do not yield increased efficacy. A positive correlation between epirubicin dose and toxicity, as well as a correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicity, was also established.",

IRF-assessed ORR was 11.5% (95% CI, 6.3% to 18.9%) for response-assessable patients. Investigator-assessed ORR for all treated patients was 18.3% (95% CI, 11.9% to 26.1%). Fifty percent of patients achieved stable disease (SD); 14.3% achieved SD >or= 6 months. Median duration of response and progression-free survival were 5.7 and 3.1 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 8.6 months. Patients received a median of 4.0 treatment cycles (range, one to 16 cycles), and 25% of patients received >or= eight cycles. Grade 3/4 treatment-related events included peripheral sensory neuropathy (14%), fatigue/asthenia (13%), myalgia (8%), and stomatitis/mucositis (6%). Resolution of grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred after a median period of 5.4 weeks. Conclusion: Ixabepilone demonstrated clear activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with MBC resistant to anthracycline, taxane, and capecitabine. Responses were durable and notable in patients who had not previously responded to multiple prior therapies.",

        "abstract": "Background: Standard chemotherapy is associated with low response rates and short progression-free survival among patients with pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines a humanized monoclonal antibody, which targets the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), with SN-38, which is conjugated to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy enables delivery of high concentrations of SN-38 to tumors. Methods: We conducted a phase 1/2 single-group, multicenter trial involving patients with advanced epithelial cancers who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. A total of 108 patients received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight after receiving at least two previous anticancer therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review. Results: The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in ≥10% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7). Conclusion: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was associated with durable objective responses in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Myelotoxic effects were the main adverse reactions. (Funded by Immunomedics; IMMU-132-01 ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "abstract": "Background: Among breast cancers without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification, overexpression, or both, a large proportion express low levels of HER2 that may be targetable. Currently available HER2-directed therapies have been ineffective in patients with these \"HER2-low\" cancers. Methods: We conducted a phase 3 trial involving patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy. (Low expression of HER2 was defined as a score of 1+ on immunohistochemical [IHC] analysis or as an IHC score of 2+ and negative results on in situ hybridization.) Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or the physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival in the hormone receptor-positive cohort. The key secondary end points were progression-free survival among all patients and overall survival in the hormone receptor-positive cohort and among all patients. Results: Of 557 patients who underwent randomization, 494 (88.7%) had hormone receptor-positive disease and 63 (11.3%) had hormone receptor-negative disease. In the hormone receptor-positive cohort, the median progression-free survival was 10.1 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.4 months in the physician's choice group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51; P<0.001), and overall survival was 23.9 months and 17.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; P = 0.003). Among all patients, the median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.1 months in the physician's choice group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; P<0.001), and overall survival was 23.4 months and 16.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; P = 0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 52.6% of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 67.4% of those who received the physician's choice of chemotherapy. Adjudicated, drug-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 12.1% of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan; 0.8% had grade 5 events. Conclusion: In this trial involving patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab deruxtecan resulted in significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than the physician's choice of chemotherapy.

Methods: Patients (n = 429) were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) (n = 214) or doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) (n = 215) on day 1, every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. Results: Time to progression (TTP; primary end point) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were significantly longer with AT than AC (median TTP, 37.3 v 31.9 weeks; log-rank P =.014; median TTF, 25.6 v 23.7 weeks; log-rank P =.048). The overall response rate (ORR) was significantly greater for patients taking AT (59%, with 10% complete response [CR], 49% partial response [PR]) than for those taking AC (47%, with 7% CR, 39% PR) (P =.009). The ORR was also higher with AT in patients with visceral involvement (58% v 41%; liver, 62% v 42%; lung, 58% v 35%), three or more organs involved (59% v 40%), or prior adjuvant CT (53% v 41%). Overall survival (OS) was comparable in both arms. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was frequent in both groups, although febrile neutropenia and infections were more frequent for patients taking AT (respectively, 33% v 10%, P <.001; 8% v 2%, P =.01). Severe nonhematologic toxicity was infrequent in both groups, including grade 3/4 cardiac events (AT, 3%; AC, 4%). Conclusion: AT significantly improves TTP and ORR compared with AC in patients with MBC, but there is no difference in OS. AT represents a valid option for the treatment of MBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of epirubicin and paclitaxel (EP) with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (except for adjuvant therapy) were randomly assigned to receive either EP (epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2) or EC (epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) administered intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. The primary outcome was progression-free survival; secondary outcome measures were overall survival, response rates, and toxicity. Results: Between 1996 and 1999, 705 patients (353 EP patients and 352 EC patients) underwent random assignment. Patient characteristics were well matched between the two groups, and 71% of patients received six cycles of treatment. Objective response rates were 65% for the EP group and 55% for the EC group (P = .015). At the time of analysis, 641 patients (91%) had died. Median progression-free survival time was 7.0 months for the EP group and 7.1 months for the EC group (hazard ratio = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.24; P = .41), and median overall survival time was 13 months for the EP group and 14 months for the EC group (hazard ratio = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.19; P = .8). EP patients, compared with EC patients, had more grade 3 and 4 mucositis (6% v 2%, respectively; P = .0006) and grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity (5% v 1%, respectively; P < .0001). Conclusion: In terms of progression-free survival and overall survival, there was no evidence of a difference between EP and EC. The data demonstrate no additional advantage to using EP instead of EC as first-line chemotherapy for MBC in taxane-naïve patients.",

Patients with four or more positive axillary nodes had a higher per cent of relapses than those with fewer nodes. The initial new clinical manifestations occurred in distant sites in 81.5 per cent of relapsed patients. Long-term chemotherapy produced an acceptable toxicity, thus allowing the administration of a high percentage of drug dosage. These results should be considered with caution, since, at present, the effect of this therapy on survival and possible long-term side effects remain unknown.",

It was designed as a pivotal study for the approval of G for a breast cancer treatment indication. Methods: Patients who relapsed after adjuvant anthracyclines were randomly assigned to gemcitabine,1,250 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 plus paclitaxel, 175 mg/m(2) on day 1; or, to paclitaxel at same dose on day 1 (both arms administered every 21 days, unblinded). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) and secondary end points were time to progression (TTP), response rate (RR), progression-free survival, response duration, and toxicity. This final OS analysis was planned at 380 deaths. Results: A total of 266 patients were randomly assigned to GT and 263 to paclitaxel. Median survival on GT was 18.6 months versus 15.8 months on paclitaxel (log-rank P = . 0489), with an adjusted Cox hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P = .0187). The TTP was longer (6.14 v 3.98 months; log-rank P = .0002) and the RR was better (41.4% v 26.2%; P = .0002) on GT. There was more grade 3 to 4 neutropenia on GT and grade 2 to 4 fatigue and neuropathy were slightly more prevalent on GT. Conclusion: This phase III study documents a role for gemcitabine in advanced breast cancer after anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy. The results establish GT as a reasonable choice for women who require cytoreduction with manageable toxicities and validate ongoing testing of GT in the adjuvant setting.",

Methods: Women (n=509) with MBC and normal cardiac function were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg/m2 (every 4 weeks) or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 (every 3 weeks). Cardiac event rates were based on reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction as a function of cumulative anthracycline dose. Results: PLD and doxorubicin were comparable with respect to PFS [6.9 versus 7.8 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR)=1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-1.22]. Subgroup results were consistent. Overall risk of cardiotoxicity was significantly higher with doxorubicin than PLD (HR=3.16; 95%CI 1.58-6.31; P<0.001). Overall survival was similar (21 and 22 months for PLD and doxorubicin, respectively; HR=0.94; 95%CI 0.74-1.19). Alopecia (overall, 66% versus 20%; pronounced, 54% versus 7%), nausea (53% versus 37%), vomiting (31% versus 19%) and neutropenia (10% versus 4%) were more often associated with doxorubicin than PLD. Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (48% versus 2%), stomatitis (22% versus 15%) and mucositis (23% versus 13%) were more often associated with PLD than doxorubicin. Conclusion: In first-line therapy for MBC, PLD provides comparable efficacy to doxorubicin, with significantly reduced cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, vomiting and alopecia.",

Methods: Eligible patients had measurable metastatic disease and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy, including anthracycline-based therapy, was allowed, as was prior hormonal therapy as part of either adjuvant treatment or treatment for metastasis. Prior therapy with taxanes or platinum was not allowed. Results: A total of 53 patients were enrolled in this study, with 50 patients evaluable for response and toxicity. The overall response rate was 62% (95% confidence interval ¿CI, 48-75%); 16% of patients had complete responses and 46% had partial responses. The median time to progression was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.9-12.9), and the 12-month survival estimate was 72% (95% CI, 61-86%). Therapy was generally well tolerated. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was the predominant toxicity, observed in 82% of patients, but there were no episodes of febrile neutropenia or sepsis. Hematopoietic growth factors were not routinely necessary. Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 16% of patients. Conclusion: Paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) with carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL per minute) demonstrated substantial efficacy in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, and the 12-month survival rate of 72% was encouraging. This therapy represents a viable option for patients with metastatic disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: To determine the activity of weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) by assessing response rate, survival, and safety. Methods: One hundred patients with ABC received paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2) (group 1, n = 20) and carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2. Paclitaxel was subsequently reduced to 100 mg/m(2) (group 2, n = 80) because of toxicity. The median age was 58.5 years, and most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of <or= 2. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status were evenly distributed among both groups. Sixty-one patients received prior chemotherapy, 37 (61%) of whom received prior doxorubicin. Among 47 patients who received prior hormonal therapy, 43 received tamoxifen. Results: The overall response rate (ORR) among 95 assessable patients was 62%, including 8% complete responses and 54% partial responses. The median time to response was 1.8 months, and the median duration of response was 13.3 months. The median time to progression was 4.8 months. The median survival was 16 months. Neutropenia and leukopenia were the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities. In group 1, neutropenia (50%) and leukopenia (35%) necessitated dose reductions for 50% of patients during the first three cycles, prompting the reduction in paclitaxel dose to 100 mg/m(2). Grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities for all patients included peripheral neuropathy (11%), infection (6%), anemia (5%), weakness (6%), and paresthesia (3%). Conclusion: The 62% ORR achieved with weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin is among the highest achieved with chemotherapy for ABC. This high response rate and the lack of cardiotoxicity suggest that the regimen should be considered as a nonanthracycline regimen for future adjuvant therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab improves the outcome in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, most cases of advanced disease eventually progress. Pertuzumab, an anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits receptor dimerization, has a mechanism of action that is complementary to that of trastuzumab, and combination therapy with the two antibodies has shown promising activity and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 studies involving patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Methods: We randomly assigned 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer to receive placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel (control group) or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel (pertuzumab group) as first-line treatment until the time of disease progression or the development of toxic effects that could not be effectively managed. The primary end point was independently assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator, the objective response rate, and safety. Results: The median progression-free survival was 12.4 months in the control group, as compared with 18.5 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.75; P<0.001). The interim analysis of overall survival showed a strong trend in favor of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel. The safety profile was generally similar in the two groups, with no increase in left ventricular systolic dysfunction; the rates of febrile neutropenia and diarrhea of grade 3 or above were higher in the pertuzumab group than in the control group. Conclusion: The combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, when used as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, significantly prolonged progression-free survival, with no increase in cardiac toxic effects.

        "abstract": "Background: Synergism between anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) and paclitaxel has been shown in vitro and in vivo. In previous experiences, weekly administration of trastuzumab and paclitaxel has shown significant activity in metastatic breast cancer. In this phase II study, we evaluated the activity and the toxicity of this weekly regimen in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Between November 1999 and July 2001, 25 patients were treated with trastuzumab (4 mg kg(-1) i.v. loading dose followed by 2 mg kg(-1) i.v. week(-1)) and paclitaxel (60-90 mg m(-2) h(-1) i.v. infusion week(-1)). The treatment was planned to continue until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity; in patients with responsive or stable disease, after 6 months of therapy, the decision to stop paclitaxel while continuing weekly trastuzumab was left to the physicians' judgement. At the median follow-up of 19.6 months (range 9.2-38.1), all patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. We obtained four (16%) complete responses (CR), 10 (40%) partial responses (PR), four (16%) stable diseases and seven (28%) disease progressions. The response rate (CR+PR) was 56% (95% CI, 36.5-75.5%). The median duration of response was 10.4 months (range 4.1-24.2+). Median time to progression was 8.6 months (range 2.5-24.2+). The toxicity was mild; five patients experienced fever and chills during the first infusion of trastuzumab (20%); leukopenia grade 2 was recorded in one patient (4%). Two patients (8%) came off study for grade 3 cardiotoxicity (after 9 and 17 weeks of treatment, respectively): both had already received anthracyclines and taxanes. Onycholysis grade 2 was observed in five patients (20%). These results confirm that weekly administration of trastuzumab and paclitaxel is active in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients HER2-overexpressing. Since cardiac disfunctions grade 3 were observed (8%), we recommend that cardiac function should be monitored in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: This phase II study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of trastuzumab and paclitaxel given every 3 weeks to women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Thirty-two patients received a loading dose of trastuzumab 8 mg/kg intravenously (day 1) and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (day 0). Thereafter, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg was administered on the same day as paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for seven cycles. In responding patients, trastuzumab monotherapy every 3 weeks was then continued until disease progression or patient withdrawal. Results: Trastuzumab trough levels were more than 20 mug/mL by the end of cycle 1. The half-life of trastuzumab was estimated to be 18 to 27 days, although this may be an underestimate. The combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities and no pharmacokinetic interaction. The most common adverse events were myalgia, paresthesias, alopecia, arthralgia, and fatigue. Events associated with trastuzumab included infusion-related reactions and cardiac dysfunction. Ten patients had a > or = 15% decrease in ejection fraction, but only one had symptomatic heart failure. The investigator-assessed objective response rate was 59% (four complete and 15 partial responses) and seven patients (22%) had stable disease. The median duration of response was 10.5 months and median time to progression was 12.2 months. Conclusion: Additional investigation of trastuzumab administered every 3 weeks is warranted. In combination with paclitaxel, it is generally well tolerated. Plasma trastuzumab trough levels and clinical response rates compare favorably with those achieved with the standard weekly trastuzumab regimen plus chemotherapy. The presence of trastuzumab does not alter exposure to paclitaxel.",

The antibody and the cytotoxic agent are conjugated by means of a stable linker. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, to T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The primary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by independent review), overall survival, and safety. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (investigator-assessed), the objective response rate, and the time to symptom progression. Two interim analyses of overall survival were conducted. Results: Among 991 randomly assigned patients, median progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (hazard ratio for progression or death from any cause, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.77; P<0.001), and median overall survival at the second interim analysis crossed the stopping boundary for efficacy (30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P<0.001). The objective response rate was higher with T-DM1 (43.6%, vs. 30.8% with lapatinib plus capecitabine; P<0.001); results for all additional secondary end points favored T-DM1. Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine than with T-DM1 (57% vs. 41%). The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher with T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine.

In a phase 1 dose-finding study, a majority of the patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer had a response to trastuzumab deruxtecan (median response duration, 20.7 months). The efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine requires confirmation. Methods: In this two-part, open-label, single-group, multicenter, phase 2 study, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan in adults with pathologically documented HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received previous treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. In the first part of the study, we evaluated three different doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan to establish a recommended dose; in the second part, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the recommended dose. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Key secondary end points were the disease-control rate, clinical-benefit rate, duration of response and progression-free survival, and safety. Results: Overall, 184 patients who had undergone a median of six previous treatments received the recommended dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg per kilogram of body weight). In the intention-to-treat analysis, a response to therapy was reported in 112 patients (60.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 53.4 to 68.0). The median duration of follow-up was 11.1 months (range, 0.7 to 19.9). The median response duration was 14.8 months (95% CI, 13.8 to 16.9), and the median duration of progression-free survival was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.7 to not reached). During the study, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 20.7% of the patients), anemia (in 8.7%), and nausea (in 7.6%). On independent adjudication, the trial drug was associated with interstitial lung disease in 13.6% of the patients (grade 1 or 2, 10.9%; grade 3 or 4, 0.5%; and grade 5, 2.2%). Conclusion: Trastuzumab deruxtecan showed durable antitumor activity in a pretreated patient population with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In addition to nausea and myelosuppression, interstitial lung disease was observed in a subgroup of patients and requires attention to pulmonary symptoms and careful monitoring.

Methods: Forty-nine patients with metastatic breast cancer received paclitaxel via 3-hour intravenous infusion after standard premedication. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not used, and chemotherapy was cycled every 3 weeks. For 25 patients who received paclitaxel as initial therapy (group I), the starting dose was 250 mg/m2. Twenty-four patients who had received two or more prior regimens, including an anthracycline (group II), started at 175 mg/m2. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 23 patients in group I. Results: Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included (groups I/II) neutropenia (36%/33%), thrombocytopenia (0%/8%), anemia (0%/13%), neuropathy (8%/0%), arthralgia/myalgia (16%/4%), and mucositis (4%/4%). No significant hypersensitivity-type reactions or cardiac arrhythmias were seen. Six patients who received paclitaxel at > or = 250 mg/m2 experienced transient photopsia, without apparent chronic neuro-ophthalmologic sequelae. The mean peak plasma paclitaxel concentration was 5.87 mumol/L (range, 1.99 to 7.89) for these patients, and 6.08 mumol/L (range, 0.81 to 13.81) for 17 of 19 patients who did not experience visual symptoms. In 25 assessable patients in group I at a median follow-up time of 12 months, one complete response (CR) and seven partial responses (PRs) have been observed, for a total response rate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15% to 53%). In group II, five PRs were noted in 24 assessable patients (20.8%; 95% CI, 7% to 42%). Median response durations were 7 months for group I and 4 months for group II. Conclusion: Paclitaxel via 3-hour infusion, without prophylactic G-CSF, is active and safe as initial and subsequent therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The transient visual symptoms noted at higher doses seem unrelated to peak plasma paclitaxel concentration. Further studies that compare 3- and 24 hour (or other) infusion schedules are necessary to determine the optimal administration of paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer.",

Trastuzumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. HER2 status was confirmed by a central laboratory review. Results: The overall response rate (ORR) with every-3-week therapy was 65% (90% confidence interval [CI], 51%-77%), with a median time to disease progression of 9.9 months and median overall survival (OS) time of 2.3 years. The ORR with weekly therapy was 81% (90% CI, 70%-90%), with a median time to disease progression of 13.8 months and a median OS time of 3.2 years.

Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or with trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). Results: The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Conclusion: Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.",

        "abstract": "Background: Phase II trials suggested that weekly paclitaxel might be more effective and less toxic than every-3-weeks administration for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 9840 was initiated to address this question. Subsequently trastuzumab was demonstrated to improve outcomes of paclitaxel therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive patients, and was therefore incorporated. Because inhibition of HER-family signaling had potential efficacy even without HER-2 overexpression, we randomly assigned for trastuzumab in this population. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or 80 mg/m(2) weekly. After the first 171 patients, all HER-2-positive patients received trastuzumab; HER-2 nonoverexpressors were randomly assigned for trastuzumab, in addition to paclitaxel schedule. A total of 577 patients were treated on 9840. An additional 158 patients were included in analyses, for combined sample of 735. The primary end point was response rate (RR); secondary end points were time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and toxicity. Primary comparisons were between weekly versus every-3-weeks paclitaxel, and trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab in HER-2 nonoverexpressors. Results: In the combined sample, weekly paclitaxel was superior to every-3-weeks administration: RR (42% v 29%, unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75; P = .0004), TTP (median, 9 v 5 months; adjusted HR = 1.43; P < .0001), and survival (median, 24 v 12 months; adjusted HR = 1.28; P = .0092). For HER-2 nonoverexpressors, trastuzumab did not improve efficacy. Grade 3 neuropathy was more common with weekly dosing (24% v 12%; P = .0003). Conclusion: Weekly paclitaxel is more effective than every-3-weeks administration for MBC. Trastuzumab did not improve efficacy for HER-2 nonoverexpressors. Neurotoxicity is a treatment-limiting toxicity for weekly paclitaxel.",

        "abstract": "Background: This randomized, multicenter trial compared first-line trastuzumab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to six cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, with or without trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly until disease progression. Results: A total of 186 patients received at least one dose of the study drug. Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was significantly superior to docetaxel alone in terms of overall response rate (61% v 34%; P = .0002), overall survival (median, 31.2 v 22.7 months; P = .0325), time to disease progression (median, 11.7 v 6.1 months; P = .0001), time to treatment failure (median, 9.8 v 5.3 months; P = .0001), and duration of response (median, 11.7 v 5.7 months; P = .009). There was little difference in the number and severity of adverse events between the arms. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was seen more commonly with the combination (32%) than with docetaxel alone (22%), and there was a slightly higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the combination arm (23% v 17%). One patient in the combination arm experienced symptomatic heart failure (1%). Another patient experienced symptomatic heart failure 5 months after discontinuation of trastuzumab because of disease progression, while being treated with an investigational anthracycline for 4 months. Conclusion: Trastuzumab combined with docetaxel is superior to docetaxel alone as first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive MBC in terms of overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure, with little additional toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of weekly docetaxel plus trastuzumab in women with HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Efficacy was correlated with serum HER-2 extracellular domain (ECD) levels. Methods: Thirty women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with weekly docetaxel and trastuzumab as first- or second-line therapy. Both docetaxel 35 mg/m(2)/wk and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg/wk were delivered in 4-week cycles consisting of three weekly treatments followed by 1 week of rest. A loading dose of trastuzumab 4 mg/kg was administered 1 day before the start of the first cycle. Results: The median delivered dose-intensity of docetaxel was 24 mg/m(2)/wk (range, 18 to 27 mg/m(2)/wk). The intent-to-treat overall response rate (ORR) was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 80%). The ORR in patients whose tumors were HER-2-positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization was 67% (16 of 24 patients; 95% CI, 45% to 84%). In patients with elevated serum HER-2 ECD at baseline, the ORR was 76% (95% CI, 53% to 92%), compared with 33% (95% CI, 7% to 70%) in patients with low HER-2 ECD levels (P =.04). Variations in HER-2 ECD concentrations during treatment correlated with response to treatment. Median time to progression was 9 months. Acute toxicity, including myelosuppression, was mild. Fatigue, fluid retention, and excessive tearing became more common with repetitive dosing. Conclusion: Weekly docetaxel and trastuzumab is an active combination for treating patients with HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Serum HER-2 ECD testing may be a promising method for monitoring patients on trastuzumab-based therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The optimal trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen for HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer is not known. The trastuzumab and vinorelbine or taxane (TRAVIOTA) study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial that was designed to compare these regimens. Methods: Eligible patients had HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer and had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine therapy or weekly taxane therapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel at the investigator's choice). Originally planned for 250 patients, the study was closed because of poor accrual with 81 evaluable patients, including 41 patients who received vinorelbine and 40 patients who received taxane. Results: Response rates were 51% and 40% for the vinorelbine/trastuzumab arm and the taxane/trastuzumab arm, respectively (Fisher exact test; P = .37). The median time to disease progression was 8.5 months and 6.0 months for the vinorelbine- and taxane-based arms, respectively (log-rank test; P = .09). Treatment with either regimen generally was well tolerated, yielding comparable rates of neurologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Vinorelbine-based treatment was associated with more anemia and neutropenia and with 2 episodes of cardiotoxicity. Taxane-based therapy was associated with more dermatologic toxicity, myalgias, and fluid retention. Conclusion: Both vinorelbine/trastuzumab and taxane/trastuzumab treatments were active as first-line therapy for HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer and had comparable rates of efficacy and tolerability. The toxicities observed were the result of recognized side effects associated with each of the chemotherapy agents and schedules.

In the German Breast Group 26/Breast International Group 03-05 trial, we investigated if trastuzumab treatment should be continued beyond progression. Methods: Patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m(2) body-surface area on days 1 through 14 [1,250 mg/m(2) semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body weight) in 3-week cycles.

        "abstract": "Background: Overexpression of the HER2 protein occurs in 25% to 30% of human breast cancers and leads to a particularly aggressive form of the disease. Efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody as a single agent was evaluated in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Methods: Two hundred twenty-two women, with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after one or two chemotherapy regimens, were enrolled. Patients received a loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously, followed by a 2-mg/kg maintenance dose at weekly intervals. Results: Study patients had advanced metastatic disease and had received extensive prior therapy. A blinded, independent response evaluation committee identified eight complete and 26 partial responses, for an objective response rate of 15% in the intent-to-treat population (95% confidence interval, 11% to 21%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months; the median duration of survival was 13 months. The most common adverse events, which occurred in approximately 40% of patients, were infusion-associated fever and/or chills that usually occurred only during the first infusion, and were of mild to moderate severity. These symptoms were treated successfully with acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine. The most clinically significant adverse event was cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 4.7% of patients. Only 1% of patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related adverse events. Conclusion: Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, administered as a single agent, produces durable objective responses and is well tolerated by women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Side effects that are commonly observed with chemotherapy, such as alopecia, mucositis, and neutropenia, are rarely seen.",

Entry criteria were relatively liberal to reflect the heterogeneity of metastatic breast cancer in clinical practice. Methods: Patients had histologically confirmed and measurable metastatic breast cancer. Up to two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, including prior therapy with anthracyclines and taxanes and prior high-dose therapy, were allowed. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) was administered weekly for 4 weeks per 4-week cycle. Results: We enrolled 212 patients; 211 were assessable for toxicity and 177 were assessable for response. Ninety percent of patients had received prior chemotherapy (adjuvant, metastatic, or both), 46% of patients had three or more involved metastatic sites, and 60% of patients had visceral-dominant disease. Responses were documented on two occasions and were independently reviewed. The overall response rate (complete plus partial response) was 21.5% (95% confidence interval, 15.4% to 27.5%), with 41.8% of patients having disease stabilization.

We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine plus trastuzumab after anthracycline and docetaxel or vinorelbine failure and prior trastuzumab exposure. Methods: Forty consecutive patients were included. Capecitabine was administered at a dose of 1,250 mg/m(2) bid for 14 consecutive days in 3-week cycles, with dose modifications if necessary. Trastuzumab was administered every 3 weeks. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as primary end point. Response was evaluated every 3 months using International Union Against Cancer criteria. Results: TTP was a median of 8 months, and overall survival was 24 months. No significant difference was found for second-line and beyond second-line treatment. A complete response (CR) was observed in 2.5%, partial response (PR) in 17.5%, stable disease lasting at least 6 months (SD) in 50%, resulting in a clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD > or = 6 months) of 70%. Diarrhea (5%) and hand-foot syndrome (15%) were the only treatment-related adverse events that occurred with grade 3 or 4 intensity. Three patients (7.5%) developed brain metastases while receiving therapy. Conclusion: Capecitabine plus trastuzumab appears to be an effective and safe option in a heavily pretreated population.

In this trial, we compared lapatinib plus capecitabine with capecitabine alone in such patients. Methods: Women with HER2-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after treatment with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive either combination therapy (lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg per day continuously plus capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg per square meter of body-surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle) or monotherapy (capecitabine alone at a dose of 2500 mg per square meter on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle). The primary end point was time to progression, based on an evaluation by independent reviewers under blinded conditions. Results: The interim analysis of time to progression met specified criteria for early reporting on the basis of superiority in the combination-therapy group. The hazard ratio for the independently assessed time to progression was 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.71; P<0.001), with 49 events in the combination-therapy group and 72 events in the monotherapy group. The median time to progression was 8.4 months in the combination-therapy group as compared with 4.4 months in the monotherapy group. This improvement was achieved without an increase in serious toxic effects or symptomatic cardiac events.

        "abstract": "Background: Preclinical studies in ErbB2-positive cell lines demonstrated a synergistic interaction between lapatinib and trastuzumab, suggesting that dual blockade is more effective than a single agent alone. EGF104900 compared the activity of lapatinib alone or in combination with trastuzumab in patients with ErbB2-positive, trastuzumab-refractory metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Patients with ErbB2-positive MBC who experienced progression on prior trastuzumab-containing regimens were randomly assigned to receive either lapatinib alone or in combination with trastuzumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary efficacy end points included overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR; complete response, partial response, and stable disease for >/= 24 weeks), and overall survival (OS). Results: In the intent-to-treat population (N = 296) who received a median of three prior trastuzumab-containing regimens, the combination of lapatinib with trastuzumab was superior to lapatinib alone for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P = .008) and CBR (24.7% in the combination arm v 12.4% in the monotherapy arm; P = .01). A trend for improved OS in the combination arm was observed (HR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.07; P = .106). There was no difference in ORR (10.3% in the combination arm v 6.9% in the monotherapy arm; P = .46). The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and fatigue; diarrhea was higher in the combination arm (P = .03). The incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events was low (combination therapy = 2% and 3.4%; monotherapy = 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively). Conclusion: Despite disease progression on prior trastuzumab-based therapy, lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab significantly improved PFS and CBR versus lapatinib alone, thus offering a chemotherapy-free option with an acceptable safety profile to patients with ErbB2-positive MBC.",

Methods: Patients, including those with stable, asymptomatic CNS disease, were randomly assigned 1:1 to neratinib (240 mg once every day) plus capecitabine (750 mg/m  twice a day 14 d/21 d) with loperamide prophylaxis, or to lapatinib (1,250 mg once every day) plus capecitabine (1,000 mg/m  twice a day 14 d/21 d). Coprimary end points were centrally confirmed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). NALA was considered positive if either primary end point was met (α split between end points). Secondary end points were time to CNS disease intervention, investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), clinical benefit rate, safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: A total of 621 patients from 28 countries were randomly assigned (N+C, n = 307; L+C, n = 314). Centrally reviewed PFS was improved with N+C (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.93; stratified log-rank  0059). The OS HR was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.07;  2098). Fewer interventions for CNS disease occurred with N+C versus L+C (cumulative incidence, 22.8%   29.2%;  043). ORRs were N+C 32.8% (95% CI, 27.1 to 38.9) and L+C 26.7% (95% CI, 21.5 to 32.4;  1201); median DoR was 8.5 versus 5.6 months, respectively (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.74;   .0004). The most common all-grade adverse events were diarrhea (N+C 83%   L+C 66%) and nausea (53%   42%). Discontinuation rates and HRQoL were similar between groups.

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of capecitabine in older women with advanced breast cancer. Methods: Seventy-three eligible patients (median age, 73 years; range, 65 to 89 years) were enrolled. The first 30 patients received oral capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days. Due to the occurrence of two toxic deaths, capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily was given to the subsequent 43 patients. Results: All patients were assessable for safety and efficacy. A total of 351 treatment cycles were administered (median, six per patient; range, one to eight cycles). Dose reductions due to toxicities were required in 30% of patients in the standard-dose group, but capecitabine was given without a dose reduction to 95% of patients in the low-dose group. Capecitabine demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The overall incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities was low: the most common events reported in </= 10% of the patients were fatigue, diarrhea, dyspnea, and nausea. In the standard-dose group, the response rate was 36.7% (95% CI, 19.9% to 56.1%). An additional seven patients had disease stabilization at >/= 24 weeks. In the low-dose group, the response rate was 34.9% (95% CI, 21% to 50.9%). An additional 15 patients had prolonged stabilization. The median time to disease progression was 4 months in either group. Conclusion: This study shows that capecitabine is safe and effective in the elderly breast cancer patient. Based on the overall results, the capecitabine dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily merits consideration as \"standard\" for older patients who do not have severely impaired renal function.",

        "abstract": "Background: Many active cytotoxic agents exist for breast cancer therapy, and numerous combination chemotherapy regimens are derived from them. Creating these combinations is sometimes empirically motivated by non-overlapping toxicities or the expectation of non-cross resistance. Yet, there is usually no absolute division of these aspects among cytotoxic agents, and the median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer has not been dramatically prolonged by this approach. When the outcome of treatment is palliation rather than cure, it becomes paramount to optimize the dynamic equilibrium between chemotherapy-induced side effects and the benefits attributable to relief of cancer-related symptoms. To this end, several recent clinical trials have evaluated the novel nucleoside analog gemcitabine (Gemzar) as single-agent therapy for advanced breast cancer. This article reviews these trials.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pembrolizumab is approved for multiple cancer types at 200 mg and 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks (Q3W). We used a model-based approach to compare the exposure of pembrolizumab 400 mg dose every 6 weeks (Q6W) with the Q3W regimens. Methods: The Q6W dose was selected by matching exposure with the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W doses. Concentration-time profiles were simulated using the established population pharmacokinetic model of pembrolizumab based on 2993 subjects from five clinical trials across tumour types. Efficacy was bridged by evaluating projections of average concentration over the dosing interval (C ) and trough concentration (C ) at steady state ( ). Safety was bridged by ensuring that concentrations were below those at 10 mg/kg dose every 2 weeks (Q2W), the maximum clinical dose. Results: The 400 mg Q6W dose had similar predicted exposure (C , geometric mean ∼1% higher) as the 200 mg Q3W dose. Fewer than 1% of subjects had transiently lower C  than that observed for 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W. Despite these reductions, similar target saturation is expected. The predicted peak concentrations (C ) for 400 mg Q6W were substantially (∼65%) lower than the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose. Conclusion: Exposures expected for pembrolizumab 400 mg Q6W were similar to the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W and below the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimens. Established exposure-response relationships for pembrolizumab over a 5-fold dose range (2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg Q2W) support that clinical efficacy and safety of 400 mg Q6W would be similar to the 200 mg and 2 mg/kg Q3W doses across tumour types.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tumour mutational burden (TMB) has been retrospectively correlated with response to immune checkpoint blockade. We prospectively explored the association of high tissue TMB (tTMB-high) with outcomes in ten tumour-type-specific cohorts from the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 study, which assessed the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab in patients with selected, previously treated, advanced solid tumours. Methods: In the multi-cohort, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 study, patients were enrolled from 81 academic facilities and community-based institutions across 21 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (ie, unresectable or metastatic, or both) incurable solid tumour (eligible tumour types were anal, biliary, cervical, endometrial, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small-cell lung, thyroid, and vulvar), progression on or intolerance to one or more lines of standard therapy, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) assessed by independent central radiological review, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 3 months, adequate organ function, and a tumour sample for biomarker analysis. Participants were given pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Tissue TMB (tTMB) was assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples using the FoundationOne CDx assay (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA). The prespecified definition of tTMB-high status was at least 10 mutations per megabase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (version 1.1) by independent central review. This prespecified analysis assessed the association between antitumour activity and tTMB in treated patients with evaluable tTMB data. Efficacy was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab, had evaluable tTMB data, and were enrolled at least 26 weeks before data cutoff (June 27, 2019), and safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and had tTMB-high status. KEYNOTE-158 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing. Results: Between Jan 15, 2016, and June 25, 2019, 1073 patients were enrolled. 1066 participants were treated as of data cutoff (June 27, 2019), of whom 805 (76%) were evaluable for TMB, and 105 (13%) of 805 had tTMB-high status and were assessed for safety. 1050 (98%) of 1066 patients enrolled by at least 26 weeks before data cutoff, of whom 790 (75%) were evaluable for TMB and included in efficacy analyses. 102 (13%) of these 790 patients had tTMB-high status (≥10 mutations per megabase), and 688 (87%) patients had non-tTMB-high status (<10 mutations per megabase). Median study follow-up was 37·1 months (IQR 35·0-38·3). Objective responses were observed in 30 (29%; 95% CI 21-39) of 102 patients in the tTMB-high group and 43 (6%; 5-8) of 688 in the non-tTMB-high group. 11 (10%) of 105 patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. 16 (15%) participants had a grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event, of which colitis was the only such adverse event that occurred in more than one patient (n=2). One patient had fatal pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator to be treatment related. Conclusion: tTMB-high status identifies a subgroup of patients who could have a robust tumour response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. tTMB could be a novel and useful predictive biomarker for response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic advanced solid tumours.",

We aimed to examine whether the addition of pembrolizumab would enhance the antitumour activity of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial, done in 209 sites in 29 countries, we randomly assigned patients 2:1 with untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using a block method (block size of six) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel; paclitaxel; or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by type of on-study chemotherapy (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 expression at baseline (combined positive score [CPS] ≥1 or <1), and previous treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (yes or no). Eligibility criteria included age at least 18 years, centrally confirmed triple-negative breast cancer; at least one measurable lesion; provision of a newly obtained tumour sample for determination of triple-negative breast cancer status and PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 0 or 1; and adequate organ function. The sponsor, investigators, other study site staff (except for the unmasked pharmacist), and patients were masked to pembrolizumab versus saline placebo administration. In addition, the sponsor, the investigators, other study site staff, and patients were masked to patient-level tumour PD-L1 biomarker results. Dual primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival assessed in the PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, CPS of 1 or more, and intention-to-treat populations. The definitive assessment of progression-free survival was done at this interim analysis; follow-up to assess overall survival is continuing. For progression-free survival, a hierarchical testing strategy was used, such that testing was done first in patients with CPS of 10 or more (prespecified statistical criterion was α=0·00411 at this interim analysis), then in patients with CPS of 1 or more (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis, with partial alpha from progression-free survival in patients with CPS of 10 or more passed over), and finally in the intention-to-treat population (α=0·00111 at this interim analysis). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing. Results: Between Jan 9, 2017, and June 12, 2018, of 1372 patients screened, 847 were randomly assigned to treatment, with 566 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 281 patients in the placebo-chemotherapy group. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff, Dec 11, 2019), median follow-up was 25·9 months (IQR 22·8-29·9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 26·3 months (22·7-29·7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Among patients with CPS of 10 or more, median progression-free survival was 9·7 months with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy and 5·6 months with placebo-chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for progression or death, 0·65, 95% CI 0·49-0·86; one-sided p=0·0012 [primary objective met]). Median progression-free survival was 7·6 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·74, 0·61-0·90; one-sided p=0·0014 [not significant]) among patients with CPS of 1 or more and 7·5 and 5·6 months (HR, 0·82, 0·69-0·97 [not tested]) among the intention-to-treat population. The pembrolizumab treatment effect increased with PD-L1 enrichment. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event rates were 68% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 67% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in <1% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Conclusion: Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus placebo-chemotherapy among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with CPS of 10 or more. These findings suggest a role for the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

Methods: LIBRETTO-001 is an ongoing phase 1/2, single-group, open-label, basket trial of selpercatinib in patients aged 18 years and older (or ≥12 years, where permitted by regulatory authorities) with RET-altered cancers. The trial is being conducted at 89 sites in 16 countries; the tumour-agnostic population was enrolled at 30 sites (outpatient and inpatient medical facilities) across eight countries. A prespecified interim analysis of LIBRETTO-001 was planned to investigate the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in a tumour-agnostic population of patients with RET fusion-positive advanced solid tumours; the data cutoff date was Sept 24, 2021. Eligible patients had disease progression on or after previous systemic therapies or no satisfactory therapeutic options and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.

Patients enrolled in the phase 1 dose-escalation portion received between 20 mg once daily or 20-240 mg twice daily; the phase 2 recommended dose was 160 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate as determined by the independent review committee. The efficacy-evaluable tumour-agnostic population was defined as patients with RET fusion-positive cancer, other than non-small-cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, who had at least 6 months of follow-up from the first study dose at the time of data cutoff (all responders at the time of data cutoff were followed up for at least 6 months from the onset of response unless they progressed or died earlier). Safety was analysed in the tumour-agnostic population of patients who had been enrolled and received selpercatinib on or before the data cutoff date. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and is still recruiting participants. Results: Between Dec 4, 2017, and Aug 4, 2021, 45 patients with RET fusion-positive tumour-agnostic cancers were enrolled from the phase 1 dose-escalation and phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts of the trial. 43 (96%) of 45 patients received a starting dose of selpercatinib at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Of the two patients who did not, one received a dose of 160 mg twice daily via intra-patient dose escalation (as allowed per protocol for patients enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study at lower doses) and the other patient's starting dose of 120 mg twice daily was never escalated. Of the 41 efficacy-evaluable patients, the objective response rate as per the independent review committee was 43·9% (95% CI 28·5-60·3; 18 of 41 patients). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (ten [22%] of 45 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase (seven [16%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [13%]). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred in 18 (40%) of 45 patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Conclusion: Selpercatinib showed clinically meaningful activity in the RET fusion-positive tumour-agnostic population, with a safety profile consistent with that observed in other indications. Comprehensive genomic testing that includes RET fusions will be crucial for identifying patients who might benefit from selpercatinib.",

Methods: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive talazoparib (1 mg once daily) or standard single-agent therapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine in continuous 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review. Results: Of the 431 patients who underwent randomization, 287 were assigned to receive talazoparib and 144 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.71; P<0.001). The interim median hazard ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06; P=0.11 [57% of projected events]). The objective response rate was higher in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (62.6% vs. 27.2%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.8; P<0.001). Hematologic grade 3-4 adverse events (primarily anemia) occurred in 55% of the patients who received talazoparib and in 38% of the patients who received standard therapy; nonhematologic grade 3 adverse events occurred in 32% and 38% of the patients, respectively. Patient-reported outcomes favored talazoparib; significant overall improvements and significant delays in the time to clinically meaningful deterioration according to both the global health status-quality-of-life and breast symptoms scales were observed. Conclusion: Among patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation, single-agent talazoparib provided a significant benefit over standard chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival.

Data on the efficacy and safety of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib, as an addition to fulvestrant therapy, in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer are limited. Methods: In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial, we enrolled eligible pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women and men with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer who had had a relapse or disease progression during or after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with or without previous cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive capivasertib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. The dual primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival assessed both in the overall population and among patients with AKT pathway-altered ( ,  , or  ) tumors. Safety was assessed. Results: Overall, 708 patients underwent randomization; 289 patients (40.8%) had AKT pathway alterations, and 489 (69.1%) had received a CDK4/6 inhibitor previously for advanced breast cancer. In the overall population, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 3.6 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.71; P<0.001). In the AKT pathway-altered population, the median progression-free survival was 7.3 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 3.1 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.65; P<0.001). The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or higher in patients receiving capivasertib-fulvestrant were rash (in 12.1% of patients, vs. in 0.3% of those receiving placebo-fulvestrant) and diarrhea (in 9.3% vs. 0.3%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 13.0% of the patients receiving capivasertib and in 2.3% of those receiving placebo.

Elacestrant is a novel, oral selective ER degrader that demonstrated activity in early studies. Methods: This randomized, open-label, phase III trial enrolled patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had one-two lines of endocrine therapy, required pretreatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and ≤ 1 chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to elacestrant 400 mg orally once daily or standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine monotherapy. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review in all patients and patients with detectable   mutations. Results: Patients were randomly assigned to elacestrant (n = 239) or SOC (n = 238).   mutation was detected in 47.8% of patients, and 43.4% received two prior endocrine therapies. PFS was prolonged in all patients (hazard ratio = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88;   = .002) and patients with   mutation (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77;   = .0005). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 7.2% receiving elacestrant and 3.1% receiving SOC. Treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations were 3.4% in the elacestrant arm versus 0.9% in SOC. Nausea of any grade occurred in 35.0% receiving elacestrant and 18.8% receiving SOC (grade 3/4, 2.5% and 0.9%, respectively). Conclusion: Elacestrant is the first oral selective ER degrader demonstrating a significant PFS improvement versus SOC both in the overall population and in patients with   mutations with manageable safety in a phase III trial for patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.",

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib, a highly selective TRK inhibitor, in adults and children who had tumors with these fusions. Methods: We enrolled patients with consecutively and prospectively identified TRK fusion-positive cancers, detected by molecular profiling as routinely performed at each site, into one of three protocols: a phase 1 study involving adults, a phase 1-2 study involving children, or a phase 2 study involving adolescents and adults. The primary end point for the combined analysis was the overall response rate according to independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. Results: A total of 55 patients, ranging in age from 4 months to 76 years, were enrolled and treated. Patients had 17 unique TRK fusion-positive tumor types. The overall response rate was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61 to 85) according to independent review and 80% (95% CI, 67 to 90) according to investigator assessment. At 1 year, 71% of the responses were ongoing and 55% of the patients remained progression-free. The median duration of response and progression-free survival had not been reached. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 86% of the patients with a response (38 of 44 patients) were continuing treatment or had undergone surgery that was intended to be curative. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1, and no adverse event of grade 3 or 4 that was considered by the investigators to be related to larotrectinib occurred in more than 5% of patients.

Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.",

Methods: Adult patients with inoperable/metastatic HR+/HER2‒ breast cancer, who had disease progression on endocrine therapy, for whom endocrine therapy was unsuitable, and had received one to two previous lines of chemotherapy in the inoperable/metastatic setting, were randomly assigned 1:1 to Dato-DXd (6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) or ICC (eribulin/vinorelbine/capecitabine/gemcitabine). Dual primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival (OS). Results: Patients were randomly assigned to Dato-DXd (n = 365) or ICC (n = 367). Dato-DXd significantly reduced the risk of progression or death versus ICC (PFS by BICR hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.76];   < .0001). Consistent PFS benefit was observed across subgroups. Although OS data were not mature, a trend favoring Dato-DXd was observed (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.14]). The rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) with Dato-DXd was lower than ICC (20.8%   44.7%). The most common TRAEs (any grade; grade ≥3) were nausea (51.1%; 1.4%) and stomatitis (50%; 6.4%) with Dato-DXd and neutropenia (grouped term, 42.5%; 30.8%) with ICC. Conclusion: Patients receiving Dato-DXd had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and a favorable and manageable safety profile, compared with ICC. Results support Dato-DXd as a novel treatment option for patients with inoperable/metastatic HR+/HER2‒ breast cancer who have received one to two previous lines of chemotherapy in this setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the phase III IMpassion130 trial, combining atezolizumab with first-line nanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (aTNBC) showed a statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive populations, and a clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) effect in PD-L1-positive aTNBC. The phase III KEYNOTE-355 trial adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy for aTNBC showed similar PFS effects. IMpassion131 evaluated first-line atezolizumab-paclitaxel in aTNBC. Methods: Eligible patients [no prior systemic therapy or ≥12 months since (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy] were randomised 2:1 to atezolizumab 840 mg or placebo (days 1, 15), both with paclitaxel 90 mg/m  (days 1, 8, 15), every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification factors were tumour PD-L1 status, prior taxane, liver metastases and geographical region. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS, tested hierarchically first in the PD-L1-positive [immune cell expression ≥1%, VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay] population, and then in the ITT population. OS was a secondary endpoint. Results: Of 651 randomised patients, 45% had PD-L1-positive aTNBC. At the primary PFS analysis, adding atezolizumab to paclitaxel did not improve investigator-assessed PFS in the PD-L1-positive population [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-1.12; P = 0.20; median PFS 6.0 months with atezolizumab-paclitaxel versus 5.7 months with placebo-paclitaxel]. In the PD-L1-positive population, atezolizumab-paclitaxel was associated with more favourable unconfirmed best overall response rate (63% versus 55% with placebo-paclitaxel) and median duration of response (7.2 versus 5.5 months, respectively). Final OS results showed no difference between arms (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.76-1.64; median 22.1 months with atezolizumab-paclitaxel versus 28.3 months with placebo-paclitaxel in the PD-L1-positive population). Results in the ITT population were consistent with the PD-L1-positive population. The safety profile was consistent with known effects of each study drug. Conclusion: Combining atezolizumab with paclitaxel did not improve PFS or OS versus paclitaxel alone. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV:  .",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer mortality in European women has been falling for three decades. We analysed trends in mortality from breast cancer in Europe over the period 1980-2017 and predicted number of deaths and rates to 2025. Methods: We extracted death certification data for breast cancer in women for 35 European countries, between 1980 and 2017, from the World Health Organisation database. We computed the age-standardised (world standard population) mortality rates per 100,000 person-years, by country and calendar year. We obtained also predictions for 2025 using a joinpoint regression model and calculated the number of avoided deaths over the period 1994-2025. Results: The mortality rate declined from 15.0 in 2012 to 14.4 in 2017 per 100,000 women (-3.9%) for the European Union (EU)-27. This fall was greater in the EU-14 (-5.2%), whereas rates rose in the transitional countries during this period by 1.9%. Mortality rate predictions across Europe are expected to reach relatively uniform levels in 2025. During the studied period, favourable trends in mortality emerged in most countries, with the greatest decrease in Denmark, whereas Poland and Romania showed an upward trend. The largest predicted decrease in breast cancer mortality was estimated for the United Kingdom (12.2/100,000 women in 2025), leading to the estimated avoidance of 150,000 breast cancer deaths over the period 1994-2025 and 470,000 in the EU-27. Conclusion: Favourable trends in breast cancer mortality were observed in most European countries, and they will continue to fall in the coming years. Less favourable patterns were still observed among the transitional countries than other European areas.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is increasingly prevalent in older adults and is a substantial part of routine oncology practice. However, management of breast cancer in this population is challenging because the disease is highly heterogeneous and there is insufficient evidence specific to older adults. Decision making should not be driven by age alone but should involve geriatric assessments plus careful consideration of life expectancy, competing risks of mortality, and patient preferences. A multidisciplinary taskforce, including members of the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists and International Society of Geriatric Oncology, gathered to expand and update the previous 2012 evidence-based recommendations for the management of breast cancer in older individuals with the endorsement of the European Cancer Organisation. These guidelines were expanded to include chemotherapy toxicity prediction calculators, cultural and social considerations, surveillance imaging, genetic screening, gene expression profiles, neoadjuvant systemic treatment options, bone-modifying drugs, targeted therapies, and supportive care. Recommendations on geriatric assessment, ductal carcinoma in situ, screening, primary endocrine therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and secondary breast cancer were updated.",

        "abstract": "Background: The European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) is a validated, widely used tool developed to score the clinical benefit from cancer medicines reported in clinical trials. ESMO-MCBS scores assume valid research methodologies and quality trial implementation. Studies incorporating flawed design, implementation, or data analysis may generate outcomes that exaggerate true benefit and are not generalisable. Failure to either indicate or penalise studies with bias undermines the intention and diminishes the integrity of ESMO-MCBS scores. This review aimed to evaluate the adequacy of the ESMO-MCBS to address bias generated by flawed design, implementation, or data analysis and identify shortcomings in need of amendment. Methods: As part of a refinement of the ESMO-MCBS, we reviewed trial design, implementation, and data analysis issues that could bias the results. For each issue of concern, we reviewed the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 approach against standards derived from Helsinki guidelines for ethical human research and guidelines from the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, the Food and Drugs Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and European Network for Health Technology Assessment. Results: Six design, two implementation, and two data analysis and interpretation issues were evaluated and in three, the ESMO-MCBS provided adequate protections. Seven shortcomings in the ability of the ESMO-MCBS to identify and address bias were identified. These related to (i) evaluation of the control arm, (ii) crossover issues, (iii) criteria for non-inferiority, (iv) substandard post-progression treatment, (v) post hoc subgroup findings based on biomarkers, (vi) informative censoring, and (vii) publication bias against quality-of-life data. Conclusion: Interpretation of the ESMO-MCBS scores requires critical appraisal of trials to understand caveats in trial design, implementation, and data analysis that may have biased results and conclusions. These will be addressed in future iterations of the ESMO-MCBS.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer have a poor prognosis. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an antibody targeting the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), which is expressed in the majority of breast cancers, coupled to SN-38 (topoisomerase I inhibitor) through a proprietary hydrolyzable linker. Methods: In this randomized, phase 3 trial, we evaluated sacituzumab govitecan as compared with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician's choice (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine) in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The primary end point was progression-free survival (as determined by blinded independent central review) among patients without brain metastases. Results: A total of 468 patients without brain metastases were randomly assigned to receive sacituzumab govitecan (235 patients) or chemotherapy (233 patients). The median age was 54 years; all the patients had previous use of taxanes. The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 6.3; 166 events) with sacituzumab govitecan and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.6; 150 events) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.52; P<0.001). The median overall survival was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.7 to 14.0) with sacituzumab govitecan and 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8 to 7.7) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.59; P<0.001). The percentage of patients with an objective response was 35% with sacituzumab govitecan and 5% with chemotherapy. The incidences of key treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (51% with sacituzumab govitecan and 33% with chemotherapy), leukopenia (10% and 5%), diarrhea (10% and <1%), anemia (8% and 5%), and febrile neutropenia (6% and 2%). There were three deaths owing to adverse events in each group; no deaths were considered to be related to sacituzumab govitecan treatment. Conclusion: Progression-free and overall survival were significantly longer with sacituzumab govitecan than with single-agent chemotherapy among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Myelosuppression and diarrhea were more frequent with sacituzumab govitecan. (Funded by Immunomedics; ASCENT ClinicalTrials.gov number,  ; EudraCT number, 2017-003019-21.).",

BYLieve aimed to assess alpelisib plus endocrine therapy in this setting in three cohorts defined by immediate previous treatment; here, we report results from cohort A. Methods: This ongoing, phase 2, multicentre, open-label, non-comparative study enrolled patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer with tumour PIK3CA mutation, following progression on or after previous therapy, including CDK4/6 inhibitors, from 114 study locations (cancer centres, medical centres, university hospitals, and hospitals) in 18 countries worldwide. Participants aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, with no more than two previous anticancer treatments and no more than one previous chemotherapy regimen, were enrolled in three cohorts. In cohort A, patients must have had progression on or after a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor as the immediate previous treatment. Patients received oral alpelisib 300 mg/day (continuously) plus fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly on day 1 of each 28-day cycle and on day 15 of cycle 1. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive without disease progression at 6 months per local assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, in patients with a centrally confirmed PIK3CA mutation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between Aug 14, 2017, and Dec 17, 2019 (data cutoff), 127 patients with at least 6 months' follow-up were enrolled into cohort A. 121 patients had a centrally confirmed PIK3CA mutation. At data cutoff, median follow-up was 11·7 months (IQR 8·5-15·9). 61 (50·4%; 95% CI 41·2-59·6) of 121 patients were alive without disease progression at 6 months. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were hyperglycaemia (36 [28%] of 127 patients), rash (12 [9%]), and rash maculopapular (12 [9%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 33 (26%) of 127 patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: BYLieve showed activity of alpelisib plus fulvestrant with manageable toxicity in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, after progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor.",

This report summarizes the safety data from the overall safety population (OSP) and efficacy data, including additional disease cohorts not published previously. Methods: Patients with refractory metastatic epithelial cancers received intravenous SG (8, 10, 12, or 18 mg/kg) on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Endpoints for the OSP included safety and pharmacokinetic parameters with investigator-evaluated objective response rate (ORR per RECIST 1.1), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival evaluated for cohorts (n > 10 patients) of small-cell lung, colorectal, esophageal, endometrial, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Results: In the OSP (n = 495, median age 61 years, 68% female; UGT1A1∗28 homozygous, n = 46; 9.3%), 41 (8.3%) permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). Most common treatment-related AEs were nausea (62.6%), diarrhea (56.2%), fatigue (48.3%), alopecia (40.4%), and neutropenia (57.8%). Most common treatment-related serious AEs (n = 75; 15.2%) were febrile neutropenia (4.0%) and diarrhea (2.8%). Grade ≥3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 42.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. Neutropenia (all grades) was numerically more frequent in UGT1A1∗28 homozygotes (28/46; 60.9%) than heterozygotes (69/180; 38.3%) or UGT1A1∗1 wild type (59/177; 33.3%). There was one treatment-related death due to an AE of aspiration pneumonia. Partial responses were seen in endometrial cancer (4/18, 22.2% ORR) and small-cell lung cancer (11/62, 17.7% ORR), and one castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient had a complete response (n = 1/11; 9.1% ORR). Conclusion: SG demonstrated a toxicity profile consistent with previous published reports. Efficacy was seen in several cancer cohorts, which validates Trop-2 as a broad target in solid tumors.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pembrolizumab showed durable antitumour activity and manageable safety in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in the single-arm KEYNOTE-012 and KEYNOTE-086 trials. In this study, we compared pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for second-line or third-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: KEYNOTE-119 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 150 medical centres (academic medical centres, community cancer centres, and community hospitals) in 31 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, with centrally confirmed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, who had received one or two previous systemic treatments for metastatic disease, had progression on their most recent therapy, and had previous treatment with an anthracycline or taxane were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a block method (block size of four) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles (pembrolizumab group), or to single-drug chemotherapy per investigator's choice of capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine (60% enrolment cap for each; chemotherapy group). Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 tumour status (positive [combined positive score (CPS) ≥1] vs negative [CPS <1]) and history of previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment versus de-novo metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Primary endpoints were overall survival in participants with a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more, those with a CPS of 1 or more, and all participants; superiority of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was tested in all participants only if shown in those with a CPS of one or more. The primary endpoint was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was analysed in the all-subjects-as-treated population. This Article describes the final analysis of the trial, which is now completed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: From Nov 25, 2015, to April 11, 2017, 1098 participants were assessed for eligibility and 622 (57%) were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab (312 [50%]) or chemotherapy (310 [50%]). Median study follow-up was 31·4 months (IQR 27·8-34·4) for the pembrolizumab group and 31·5 months (27·8-34·6) for the chemotherapy group. Median overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more was 12·7 months (95% CI 9·9-16·3) for the pembrolizumab group and 11·6 months (8·3-13·7) for the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·78 [95% CI 0·57-1·06]; log-rank p=0·057). In participants with a CPS of 1 or more, median overall survival was 10·7 months (9·3-12·5) for the pembrolizumab group and 10·2 months (7·9-12·6) for the chemotherapy group (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·69-1·06]; log-rank p=0·073). In the overall population, median overall survival was 9·9 months (95% CI 8·3-11·4) for the pembrolizumab group and 10·8 months (9·1-12·6) for the chemotherapy group (HR 0·97 [95% CI 0·82-1·15]). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (three [1%] patients in the pembrolizumab group vs ten [3%] in the chemotherapy group), decreased white blood cells (one [<1%] vs 14 [5%]), decreased neutrophil count (one [<1%] vs 29 [10%]), and neutropenia (0 vs 39 [13%]). 61 (20%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 58 (20%) patients in the chemotherapy group had serious adverse events. Three (<1%) of 601 participants had treatment-related adverse events that led to death (one [<1%] in the pembrolizumab group due to circulatory collapse; two [1%] in the chemotherapy group, one [<1%] due to pancytopenia and sepsis and one [<1%] haemothorax). Conclusion: Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer versus chemotherapy. These findings might inform future research of pembrolizumab monotherapy for selected subpopulations of patients, specifically those with PD-L1-enriched tumours, and inform a combinatorial approach for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: There is currently no clinical trial data regarding the efficacy of everolimus exemestane (EE) following prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i). This study assesses the use and efficacy of everolimus exemestane in patients with metastatic HR+ HER2- breast cancer previously treated with endocrine therapy (ET) or endocrine therapy + CDK4/6i. Methods: Retrospective analysis of electronic health record-derived data for HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer from 2012 to 2018. The proportion of patients receiving EE first-line, second-line, or third-line, and the median duration of EE prior to next line of treatment (TTNT) by line of therapy was calculated. OS for patients receiving EE first-line, second-line, or third-line, indexed to the date of first-line therapy initiation and stratified by prior treatment received, was calculated with Kaplan-Meier method with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: Six hundred twenty-two patients received EE first-line (n = 104, 16.7%), second-line (n = 273, 43.9%) or third-line (n = 245, 39.4%). Median TTNT was 8.3 months, 5.5 months, and 4.8 months respectively. Median TTNT of EE second-line was longer following prior ET alone compared to prior ET + CDK4/6i (6.2 months (95% CI 5.2, 7.3) vs 4.3 months (95% CI 3.2, 5.7) respectively, p = 0.03). Similarly, EE third-line following ET alone vs ET + CDK4/6i in first- or second-line resulted in median TTNT 5.6 months (95% CI 4.4, 6.9) vs 4.1 months (95% CI 3.6, 6.1) respectively, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Median OS was longer for patients who received EE following prior ET + CDK4/6i. EE second-line following ET + CDK 4/6i vs ET alone resulted in median OS 37.7 months vs. 32.7 months (p = 0.449). EE third-line following ET + CDK4/6i vs prior ET alone resulted in median OS 59.2 months vs. 40.8 months (p < 0.010). This difference in OS was not statistically significant when indexed to the start of EE therapy. Conclusion: This study suggests that EE remains an effective treatment option after prior ET or ET + CDK4/6i use. Median TTNT of EE was longer for patients who received prior ET, whereas median OS was longer for patients who received prior ET + CDK4/6i. However, this improvement in OS was not statistically significant when indexed to the start of EE therapy suggesting that OS benefit is primarily driven by prior CDK4/6i use. EE remains an effective treatment option regardless of prior treatment option.",

In the overall population, durvalumab did not improve progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.96; P = 0.047) or overall survival (OS; adjusted HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.54-1.29; P = 0.423). In an exploratory subgroup analysis, durvalumab improved OS in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; n = 82; HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30-0.97, P = 0.0377). Exploratory analysis showed that the HR of death was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12-1.13) for patients with PD-L1  TNBC (n = 32) and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.18-1.34) for those with PD-L1  TNBC (n = 29). In patients with TNBC, exploratory analyses showed that the HR for durvalumab efficacy (OS) was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.05-0.71; log-rank test, P = 0.0059) in patients with CD274 gain/amplification (n = 23) and 1.12 (95% CI: 0.42-2.99; log-rank test, P = 0.8139) in patients with CD274 normal/loss (n = 32). Tumor infiltration by lymphocytes (CD8, FoxP3 and CD103 expressions) and homologous recombination deficiency did not predict sensitivity to durvalumab in exploratory analyses. This latter finding should be interpreted with caution since only one patient presented a germline BRCA mutation. The present study provides a rationale to evaluate single-agent durvalumab in maintenance therapy in patients with TNBC. Exploratory analyses identified CD274 amplification as a potential biomarker of sensitivity. Maintenance chemotherapy was more effective than durvalumab in patients with hormone receptor-positive and Her2-negative disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) is the standard treatment of hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, its efficacy has not been compared with that of chemotherapy in a phase III trial. Methods: PEARL is a multicentre, phase III randomised study in which patients with aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant MBC were included in two consecutive cohorts. In cohort 1, patients were randomised 1 : 1 to palbociclib plus exemestane or capecitabine. On discovering new evidence about estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1) mutations inducing resistance to AIs, the trial was amended to include cohort 2, in which patients were randomised 1 : 1 between palbociclib plus fulvestrant and capecitabine. The stratification criteria were disease site, prior sensitivity to ET, prior chemotherapy for MBC, and country of origin. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in cohort 2 and in wild-type ESR1 patients (cohort 1 + cohort 2). ESR1 hotspot mutations were analysed in baseline circulating tumour DNA. Results: From March 2014 to July 2018, 296 and 305 patients were included in cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively. Palbociclib plus ET was not superior to capecitabine in both cohort 2 [median PFS: 7.5 versus 10.0 months; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.50] and wild-type ESR1 patients (median PFS: 8.0 versus 10.6 months; aHR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.87-1.41). The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities with palbociclib plus exemestane, palbociclib plus fulvestrant and capecitabine, respectively, were neutropenia (57.4%, 55.7% and 5.5%), hand/foot syndrome (0%, 0% and 23.5%), and diarrhoea (1.3%, 1.3% and 7.6%). Palbociclib plus ET offered better quality of life (aHR for time to deterioration of global health status: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53-0.85). Conclusion: There was no statistical superiority of palbociclib plus ET over capecitabine with respect to PFS in MBC patients resistant to AIs. Palbociclib plus ET showed a better safety profile and improved quality of life.",

The SOLAR-1 trial showed that the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant treatment provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2- ABC. Methods: Men and postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC whose disease progressed on or after aromatase inhibitor (AI) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Overall survival (OS) in the PIK3CA-mutant cohort was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methodology and a one-sided stratified log-rank test was carried out with an O'Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary of P ≤ 0.0161. Results: In the PIK3CA-mutated cohort (n = 341), median OS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 39.3 months (34.1-44.9) for alpelisib-fulvestrant and 31.4 months (26.8-41.3) for placebo-fulvestrant [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.86 (95% CI, 0.64-1.15; P = 0.15)]. OS results did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary. Median OS (95% CI) in patients with lung and/or liver metastases was 37.2 months (28.7-43.6) and 22.8 months (19.0-26.8) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant and placebo-fulvestrant arms, respectively [HR = 0.68 (0.46-1.00)]. Median times to chemotherapy (95% CI) for the alpelisib-fulvestrant and placebo-fulvestrant arms were 23.3 months (15.2-28.4) and 14.8 months (10.5-22.6), respectively [HR = 0.72 (0.54-0.95)]. No new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. Conclusion: Although the analysis did not cross the prespecified boundary for statistical significance, there was a 7.9-month numeric improvement in median OS when alpelisib was added to fulvestrant treatment of patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2- ABC. Overall, these results further support the statistically significant prolongation of PFS observed with alpelisib plus fulvestrant in this population, which has a poor prognosis due to a PIK3CA mutation.

        "abstract": "Background: The combination of everolimus (EVE) and exemestane (EXE) is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (mHRBC) who progress on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy. However, none of the patients enrolled in the trial that led to this approval (BOLERO-2) had previously received CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is), which have since become a frontline standard of care for mHRBC. As such, the clinical benefit of EVE plus EXE in patients who have previously received CDK4/6is remains unknown. Methods: Adult patients with mHRBC at our institution who progressed on an NSAI plus CDK4/6i or NSAI therapy alone and were treated with at least one cycle of EVE plus EXE between 2012 and 2018 were analyzed. Collected data included patient demographics, treatment history, adverse events, and clinical outcomes. Primary objectives were to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who received prior NSAI plus CDK4/6i therapy versus an NSAI alone. Results: Among 43 patients, 17 had prior CDK4/6i exposure. With the exception of de novo metastatic disease, patient and disease characteristics were comparable across treatment cohorts. There was no significant difference in PFS (median, 3.6 vs. 4.2 months) or OS (median, 15.6 vs. 11.3 months) between patients who had received prior CDK4/6is and those who had not, respectively. Conclusion: Prior exposure to CDK4/6i therapy did not impact survival outcomes for patients with mHRBC taking EVE plus EXE. However, there was a trend toward improved OS in the CDK4/6i cohort that should be evaluated in larger cohorts.",

        "abstract": "Background: Background CT and bone scintigraphy have limitations in evaluating systemic anticancer therapy (SACT) response in bone metastases from metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Purpose To evaluate whether whole-body MRI enables identification of progressive disease (PD) earlier than CT and bone scintigraphy in bone-only MBC. Materials and Methods This prospective study evaluated participants with bone-only MBC between May 2016 and January 2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ). Participants were enrolled at initiation of first or subsequent SACT based on standard CT and bone scintigraphy imaging. Baseline whole-body MRI was performed within 2 weeks of entry; those with extraosseous disease were excluded. CT and whole-body MRI were performed every 12 weeks until definitive PD was evident with one or both modalities. In case of PD, bone scintigraphy was used to assess for bone disease progression. Radiologists independently interpreted images from CT, whole-body MRI, or bone scintigraphy and were blinded to results with the other modalities. Systematic differences in performance between modalities were analyzed by using the McNemar test. Results Forty-five participants (mean age, 60 years ± 13 [standard deviation]; all women) were evaluated. Median time on study was 36 weeks (range, 1-120 weeks). Two participants were excluded because of unequivocal evidence of liver metastases at baseline whole-body MRI, two participants were excluded because they had clinical progression before imaging showed PD, and one participant was lost to follow-up. Of the 33 participants with PD at imaging, 67% (22 participants) had PD evident at whole-body MRI only and 33% (11 participants) had PD at CT and whole-body MRI concurrently; none had PD at CT only (  < .001, McNemar test). There was only slight agreement between whole-body MRI and CT (Cohen κ, 0.15). PD at bone scintigraphy was reported in 50% of participants (13 of 26) with bone progression at CT and/or whole-body MRI (  < .001, McNemar test). Conclusion Whole-body MRI enabled identification of progressive disease before CT in most participants with bone-only metastatic breast cancer. Progressive disease at bone scintigraphy was evident in only half of participants with bone progression at whole-body MRI. © RSNA, 2020",

        "abstract": "Background: BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutated breast cancers are sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum agents owing to deficiency in homologous recombination repair of DNA damage. In this trial, we compared veliparib versus placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and continued as monotherapy if carboplatin and paclitaxel were discontinued before progression, in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Methods: BROCADE3 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 147 hospitals in 36 countries. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) had deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation-associated, histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced HER2-negative breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received up to two previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive response technology by means of permuted blocks within strata (block size of 3 or 6) to carboplatin (area under the concentration curve 6 mg/mL per min intravenously) on day 1 and paclitaxel (80 mg/m  intravenously) on days 1, 8, and 15 of 21-day cycles combined with either veliparib (120 mg orally twice daily, on days -2 to 5) or matching placebo. If patients discontinued carboplatin and paclitaxel before progression, they could continue veliparib or placebo at an intensified dose (300 mg twice daily continuously, escalating to 400 mg twice daily if tolerated) until disease progression. Patients in the control group could receive open-label veliparib monotherapy after disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by previous platinum use, history of CNS metastases, and oestrogen and progesterone receptor status. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat, which included all randomly assigned patients with a centrally confirmed BRCA mutation, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of velilparib or placebo. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between July 30, 2014, and Jan 17, 2018, 2202 patients were screened, of whom 513 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. In the intention-to-treat population (n=509), 337 patients were assigned to receive veliparib plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (veliparib group) and 172 were assigned to receive placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (control group). Median follow-up at data cutoff (April 5, 2019) was 35·7 months (IQR 24·9-43·6) in the veliparib group and 35·5 months (23·1-45·9) in the control group. Median progression-free survival was 14·5 months (95% CI 12·5-17·7) in the veliparib group versus 12·6 months (10·6-14·4) in the control group (hazard ratio 0·71 [95% CI 0·57-0·88], p=0·0016). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (272 [81%] of 336 patients in the veliparib group vs 143 [84%] of 171 patients in the control group), anaemia (142 [42%] vs 68 [40%]), and thrombocytopenia (134 [40%] vs 48 [28%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 115 (34%) patients in the veliparib group versus 49 (29%) patients in the control group. There were no study drug-related deaths. Conclusion: The addition of veliparib to a highly active platinum doublet, with continuation as monotherapy if the doublet were discontinued, resulted in significant and durable improvement in progression-free survival in patients with germline BRCA mutation-associated advanced breast cancer. These data indicate the utility of combining platinum and PARP inhibitors in this patient population.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the HER2CLIMB study, patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer with brain metastases (BMs) showed statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with tucatinib. We describe exploratory analyses of intracranial efficacy and survival in participants with BMs. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to tucatinib or placebo, in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. All patients underwent baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging; those with BMs were classified as active or stable. Efficacy analyses were performed by applying RECIST 1.1 criteria to CNS target lesions by investigator assessment. CNS-PFS (intracranial progression or death) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in all patients with BMs. Confirmed intracranial objective response rate (ORR-IC) was evaluated in patients with measurable intracranial disease. Results: There were 291 patients with BMs: 198 (48%) in the tucatinib arm and 93 (46%) in the control arm. The risk of intracranial progression or death was reduced by 68% in the tucatinib arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.48;   < .0001). Median CNS-PFS was 9.9 months in the tucatinib arm versus 4.2 months in the control arm. Risk of death was reduced by 42% in the tucatinib arm (OS HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.85;   = .005). Median OS was 18.1 versus 12.0 months. ORR-IC was higher in the tucatinib arm (47.3%; 95% CI, 33.7% to 61.2%) versus the control arm (20.0%; 95% CI, 5.7% to 43.7%;   = .03). Conclusion: In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with BMs, the addition of tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine doubled ORR-IC, reduced risk of intracranial progression or death by two thirds, and reduced risk of death by nearly half. To our knowledge, this is the first regimen to demonstrate improved antitumor activity against BMs in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in a randomized, controlled trial.",

        "abstract": "Background: CLEOPATRA was a phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In the primary analysis and subsequent reports, progression-free and overall survival were significantly improved in the pertuzumab group compared with the placebo group. Here, we report the end-of-study analysis of CLEOPATRA. Methods: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 204 centres in 25 countries. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer, had not received previous chemotherapy or biological treatment for their metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. All study drugs were given intravenously, every 3 weeks. Patients were assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo at a loading dose of 840 mg, and 420 mg thereafter; plus trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg loading dose and 6 mg/kg thereafter; and docetaxel at 75 mg/m , escalating to 100 mg/m  if tolerated. Pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab were given until disease progression; docetaxel was given for six cycles, or longer at the investigators' discretion. Randomisation (1:1) was done by use of an interactive voice-response system and was stratified by geographical region (Asia, Europe, North America, or South America) and previous treatment (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs none). The primary endpoint was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival, which has been reported previously. Since the confirmatory overall survival analysis had also occurred before this prespecified end-of-study analysis, analyses presented here are descriptive. Overall survival analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with crossover patients analysed in the placebo group; analyses were not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and are likely to be conservative. Safety analyses were based on treatment received; crossover patients were counted in the placebo group up to the day before first pertuzumab dose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between Feb 12, 2008, and July 7, 2010, 1196 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 808 were enrolled and randomly assigned. 402 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 406 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus placebo. Clinical cutoff for this analysis was Nov 23, 2018. Between July 2012 and clinical cutoff, 50 patients crossed from the placebo to the pertuzumab group. Median follow-up was 99·9 months in the pertuzumab group (IQR 92·9-106·4) and 98·7 months (90·9-105·7) in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 57·1 months (95% CI 50-72) in the pertuzumab group and 40·8 months (36-48) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·58-0·82); 8-year landmark overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI 31-42) in the pertuzumab group and 23% (19-28) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (200 [49%] of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group, 183 [46%] of 396 patients in the placebo group). Five (1%) of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group and six (2%) of 396 patients in the placebo group had treatment-related deaths. One new serious adverse event suggestive of congestive heart failure (pertuzumab group) and one new symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (post-crossover) occurred since the previous analysis. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that the previously observed improvements in overall survival with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained after a median of more than 8 years of follow-up. The long-term safety and cardiac safety profiles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained in the overall safety population and within crossover patients. HER2-targeted therapy has changed the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the dual blockade of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with docetaxel, demonstrating an 8-year landmark overall survival rate of 37%.",

        "abstract": "Background: The current status and time trends in breast cancer incidence and survival in the 28 European Union countries (EU-28) is presented here. Rates reported are age adjusted and standardized (ASR). A high incidence and high survival rates were observed in the Northern and Western European countries, with the exception of the Baltic countries. The higher incidence is partly attributed to the higher prevalence of lifestyle risk factors, while the higher survival is attributed to better access to beneficial treatments and general health care. Most of the countries in Southern Europe or the former Eastern Bloc have not yet reached the high GDP per capita status (2017 purchasing power parity; PPP) of the earlier established Western democracies. The breast cancer incidence and survival are associated with the PPP level (both higher for the higher PPP category; 2017 PPP above USD 40,000).

        "abstract": "Background: Oligometastatic disease has been proposed as an intermediate state between localised and systemically metastasised disease. In the absence of randomised phase 3 trials, early clinical studies show improved survival when radical local therapy is added to standard systemic therapy for oligometastatic disease. However, since no biomarker for the identification of patients with true oligometastatic disease is clinically available, the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease is based solely on imaging findings. A small number of metastases on imaging could represent different clinical scenarios, which are associated with different prognoses and might require different treatment strategies. 20 international experts including 19 members of the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer OligoCare project developed a comprehensive system for characterisation and classification of oligometastatic disease. We first did a systematic review of the literature to identify inclusion and exclusion criteria of prospective interventional oligometastatic disease clinical trials. Next, we used a Delphi consensus process to select a total of 17 oligometastatic disease characterisation factors that should be assessed in all patients treated with radical local therapy for oligometastatic disease, both within and outside of clinical trials. Using a second round of the Delphi method, we established a decision tree for oligometastatic disease classification together with a nomenclature. We agreed oligometastatic disease as the overall umbrella term. A history of polymetastatic disease before diagnosis of oligometastatic disease was used as the criterion to differentiate between induced oligometastatic disease (previous history of polymetastatic disease) and genuine oligometastatic disease (no history of polymetastatic disease). We further subclassified genuine oligometastatic disease into repeat oligometastatic disease (previous history of oligometastatic disease) and de-novo oligometastatic disease (first time diagnosis of oligometastatic disease). In de-novo oligometastatic disease, we differentiated between synchronous and metachronous oligometastatic disease. We did a final subclassification into oligorecurrence, oligoprogression, and oligopersistence, considering whether oligometastatic disease is diagnosed during a treatment-free interval or during active systemic therapy and whether or not an oligometastatic lesion is progressing on current imaging. This oligometastatic disease classification and nomenclature needs to be prospectively evaluated by the OligoCare study.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDKIs) are indicated with endocrine therapy as first-line or second-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to investigate the benefit of adding CDKIs to endocrine therapy in patients whose tumours might have differing degrees of endocrine sensitivity. Methods: We pooled individual patient data from all phase 3 randomised breast cancer trials of CDKIs plus endocrine therapy submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration before Jan 1, 2019, in support of marketing applications. Our pooled analysis included all randomly assigned patients in these trials who received at least one dose of CDKI or placebo with endocrine therapy (an aromatase inhibitor [letrozole or anastrazole] or fulvestrant). We did prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with progesterone receptor-negative disease; patients with a disease-free interval of 12 months or less; patients with de-novo metastases, lobular histology, and bone-only disease; patients with visceral metastases; and patients aged up to 40 years. Patients who were not treated, who received tamoxifen as endocrine therapy, or who were treated with an aromatase inhibitor but who had received previous chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (not first-line) were excluded from our pooled analyses. All studies had a primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival, defined as time from date of randomisation to the initial date of documented cancer progression or death, whichever occurred first. Median progression-free survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs for progression-free survival were estimated by means of Cox regression models. Results: The seven studies meeting this study's inclusion criteria were done between Feb 22, 2013, and Nov 3, 2017, with a median duration of follow-up of 19·7 months (IQR 15·9-25·9). 4200 patients were included in the pooled analysis, of whom 1320 received an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDKI, 932 received placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor, 1296 received fulvestrant plus a CDKI, and 652 received fulvestrant plus placebo. Across all seven pooled trials, the difference in estimated median progression-free survival was 8·8 months in favour of CDKI plus endocrine therapy over placebo plus endocrine therapy (range across the trials 6·8-13·3 months; HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·54-0·64). Progression-free survival results favoured the CDKI group in all prespecified clinicopathological subgroups analysed, with similar HRs to that for the broader intended-use population. In first-line aromatase inhibitor-treated patients (n=2252), the median progression-free survival in the CDKI plus aromatase inhibitor group was 28·0 months (95% CI 25·3-29·1) versus 14·9 months (14·0-16·7) in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor group (difference 13·1 months; range across the trials 13·0-13·3 months; HR 0·55, 95% CI 0·49-0·62). In first-line fulvestrant-treated patients (n=396), the median progression-free survival was 18·6 months (95% CI 14·8-23·5) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group and not estimable (22·4 to not estimable) in the CDKI plus fulvestrant group (difference not estimable; HR 0·58, 95% CI 0·42-0·80). In the patients treated with fulvestrant in the second-line setting and beyond (n=1552), the difference in estimated median progression-free survival between the CDKI plus fulvestrant group and the placebo plus fulvestrant group was 6·9 months in favour of the CDKI group (range across the trials 5·5-7·3 months; HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·49-0·64). Conclusion: Since the addition of CDKI to endocrine therapy seemed to benefit all clinicopathological subgroups of interest in this pooled analysis, further research is needed to identify patient subgroups for whom endocrine therapy alone might be appropriate for first-line or second-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: In an earlier analysis of this phase 3 trial, ribociclib plus fulvestrant showed a greater benefit with regard to progression-free survival than fulvestrant alone in postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Here we report the results of a protocol-specified second interim analysis of overall survival. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ribociclib or placebo in addition to fulvestrant as first-line or second-line treatment. Survival was evaluated by means of a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: This analysis was based on 275 deaths: 167 among 484 patients (34.5%) receiving ribociclib and 108 among 242 (44.6%) receiving placebo. Ribociclib plus fulvestrant showed a significant overall survival benefit over placebo plus fulvestrant. The estimated overall survival at 42 months was 57.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.0 to 63.2) in the ribociclib group and 45.9% (95% CI, 36.9 to 54.5) in the placebo group, for a 28% difference in the relative risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.92; P = 0.00455). The benefit was consistent across most subgroups. In a descriptive update, median progression-free survival among patients receiving first-line treatment was 33.6 months (95% CI, 27.1 to 41.3) in the ribociclib group and 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.9 to 23.6) in the placebo group. No new safety signals were observed.

        "abstract": "Background: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer who have disease progression after therapy with multiple HER2-targeted agents have limited treatment options. Tucatinib is an investigational, oral, highly selective inhibitor of the HER2 tyrosine kinase. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine, who had or did not have brain metastases, to receive either tucatinib or placebo, in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. The primary end point was progression-free survival among the first 480 patients who underwent randomization. Secondary end points, assessed in the total population (612 patients), included overall survival, progression-free survival among patients with brain metastases, confirmed objective response rate, and safety. Results: Progression-free survival at 1 year was 33.1% in the tucatinib-combination group and 12.3% in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.71; P<0.001), and the median duration of progression-free survival was 7.8 months and 5.6 months, respectively. Overall survival at 2 years was 44.9% in the tucatinib-combination group and 26.6% in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.88; P = 0.005), and the median overall survival was 21.9 months and 17.4 months, respectively. Among the patients with brain metastases, progression-free survival at 1 year was 24.9% in the tucatinib-combination group and 0% in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.69; P<0.001), and the median progression-free survival was 7.6 months and 5.4 months, respectively. Common adverse events in the tucatinib group included diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, nausea, fatigue, and vomiting. Diarrhea and elevated aminotransferase levels of grade 3 or higher were more common in the tucatinib-combination group than in the placebo-combination group. Conclusion: In heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine resulted in better progression-free survival and overall survival outcomes than adding placebo; the risks of diarrhea and elevated aminotransferase levels were higher with tucatinib.

        "abstract": "Background: Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy has shown promising efficacy across many different tumour types. We report the prespecified second interim overall survival analysis of the phase 3 IMpassion130 study assessing the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial, done in 246 academic centres and community oncology practices in 41 countries, patients aged 18 years or older, with previously untreated, histologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a permuted block method (block size of four) and an interactive voice-web response system. Randomisation was stratified by previous taxane use, liver metastases, and PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells. Patients received atezolizumab 840 mg or matching placebo intravenously on day 1 and day 15 of every 28-day cycle and nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m  of body surface area intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Investigators, patients, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population and in patients with PD-L1 immune cell-positive tumours (tumours with ≥1% PD-L1 expression). The final progression-free survival results were previously reported at the first interim overall survival analysis. The prespecified statistical testing hierarchy meant that overall survival in the subgroup of PD-L1 immune cell-positive patients could only be formally tested if overall survival was significantly different between the treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between June 23, 2015, and May 24, 2017, 902 patients were enrolled, of whom 451 were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 451 were assigned to receive placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (the intention-to-treat population). Six patients from each group did not receive treatment. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff Jan 2, 2019), median follow-up was 18·5 months (IQR 9·6-22·8) in the atezolizumab group and 17·5 months (8·4-22·4) in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat patients was 21·0 months (95% CI 19·0-22·6) with atezolizumab and 18·7 months (16·9-20·3) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·86, 95% CI 0·72-1·02, p=0·078). In the exploratory overall survival analysis in patients with PD-L1 immune cell-positive tumours, median overall survival was 25·0 months (95% CI 19·6-30·7) with atezolizumab versus 18·0 months (13·6-20·1) with placebo (stratified HR 0·71, 0·54-0·94]). As of Sept 3, 2018 (the date up to which updated safety data were available), the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (38 [8%] of 453 patients in the atezolizumab group vs 36 [8%] of 437 patients in the placebo group), peripheral neuropathy (25 [6%] vs 12 [3%]), decreased neutrophil count (22 [5%] vs 16 [4%]), and fatigue (17 [4%] vs 15 [3%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in two (<1%) patients in the atezolizumab group (autoimmune hepatitis related to atezolizumab [n=1] and septic shock related to nab-paclitaxel [n=1]) and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group (hepatic failure). No new treatment-related deaths have been reported since the primary clinical data cutoff date (April 17, 2018). Conclusion: Consistent with the first interim analysis, this second interim overall survival analysis of IMpassion130 indicates no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population but suggests a clinically meaningful overall survival benefit with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with PD-L1 immune cell-positive disease. However, this positive result could not be formally tested due to the prespecified statistical testing hierarchy. For patients with PD-L1 immune cell-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel is an important therapeutic option in a disease with high unmet need.",

        "abstract": "Background: Endocrine treatment is recommended by clinical guidelines as the preferred treatment option for premenopausal as well as postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. In real-world clinical practice, however, a substantial number of patients are treated with chemotherapy. We aimed to compare the clinical antitumour activity and safety of palbociclib plus endocrine therapy with that of capecitabine chemotherapy in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Methods: This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 study was done in 14 academic institutions in South Korea. Premenopausal women aged 19 years or older with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that had relapsed or progressed during previous tamoxifen therapy and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were included. One line of previous chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer was allowed. Patients were randomly assigned, using a random permuted block design (with a block size of two), to receive palbociclib plus combination endocrine therapy (oral exemestane 25 mg per day for 28 days and oral palbociclib 125 mg per day for 21 days every 4 weeks plus leuprolide 3·75 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks) or chemotherapy (oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m  twice daily for 2 weeks every 3 weeks). Randomisation was stratified by previous chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and visceral metastasis. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All analyses were done in a modified intention-to-treat population that excluded patients who did not receive study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing for follow-up of overall survival. Results: Between June 15, 2016, and Dec 10, 2018, 189 patients were enrolled, of whom 184 were randomly assigned to the palbociclib plus endocrine therapy group (n=92) or the capecitabine group (n=92). Six patients in the capecitabine group withdrew from the study before drug administration; therefore, 92 patients in the palbociclib plus endocrine therapy group and 86 patients in the capecitabine group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. 46 (50%) of 92 patients in the palbociclib plus endocrine therapy group and 45 (51%) of 92 in the capecitabine group were treatment naive for metastatic breast cancer. During a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 9-22), median progression-free survival was 20·1 months (95% CI 14·2-21·8) in the palbociclib plus endocrine therapy group versus 14·4 months (12·1-17·0) in the capecitabine group (hazard ratio 0·659 [95% CI 0·437-0·994], one-sided log-rank p=0·0235). Treatment-related grade 3 or worse neutropenia was more common in the palbociclib plus endocrine therapy group than in the capecitabine group (69 [75%] of 92 vs 14 [16%] of 86 patients). 2 (2%) patients in the palbociclib plus endocrine therapy group and 15 (17%) patients in the capecitabine group had treatment-related serious adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Conclusion: Exemestane plus palbociclib with ovarian function suppression showed clinical benefit compared with capecitabine in terms of improved progression-free survival in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Palbociclib plus exemestane with ovarian suppression is an active treatment option in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have been pretreated with tamoxifen.",

        "abstract": "Background: Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend against screening breast cancer patients for asymptomatic brain metastases. Because brain metastases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality from breast cancer, we undertook a literature review to ascertain whether there might be a role for brain metastases screening in high-risk patient subgroups. Methods: A literature search was conducted on the OvidSP platform in the MedLine database, using MeSH terms and subject headings related to breast cancer, brain metastases, and incidence. The search was conducted without language or publication restrictions, and included articles indexed from January 1, 2006 to June 10, 2018. Experimental and observational studies that reported the incidence of brain metastases in patients with nonmetastatic or metastatic breast cancer were included. Results: One hundred seventy studies were identified, with 33 included in the final analysis. Among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients, incidence of brain metastases as site of first recurrence per year of median follow-up ranged from 0.1% to 3.2%. Although incidence of brain metastases was much higher among the metastatic breast cancer population overall, it was particularly high among metastatic HER2-overexpressing (HER2 ) and triple-negative populations, ranging between 22% and 36% for the former, and 15%-37% for the latter in the absence of screening. Conclusion: In patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, screening for asymptomatic brain metastases cannot currently be justified. However, due to the high incidence of brain metastases among patients with metastatic HER2  and triple-negative breast cancer, studies to determine the value of screening for brain metastases should be undertaken in these subgroups.",

From this study, we report the effect of olaparib on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: Patients were randomised 2:1 to olaparib monotherapy (300 mg twice daily) or single-agent TPC. The primary HRQoL end-point was mean change from baseline in the two-item global health status/QoL score determined from patient-completed European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item module (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaires and assessed using a mixed model for repeated measures. Symptoms and functioning domains, best overall response and time to deterioration of QoL were also evaluated. Results: Overall questionnaire compliance rates were 93.2% for olaparib and 76.3% for TPC. Between-treatment global health status/QoL comparison showed a significant improvement in the olaparib arm versus the TPC arm, with mean change of 3.9 (standard deviation 1.2) versus -3.6 (2.2), a difference of 7.5 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.48, 12.44; P = 0.0035). A higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm showed a best overall response of 'improvement' in global health status/QoL (33.7% vs 13.4%). Median time to global health status/QoL deterioration was not reached in olaparib patients and was 15.3 months for TPC patients (hazard ratio: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.77]; P = 0.004). For EORTC QLQ-C30 symptoms and functioning subscales, only nausea/vomiting symptom score was worse in the olaparib arm than in the TPC arm (across all visits compared with baseline). Conclusion: HRQoL was consistently improved for patients treated with olaparib, compared with chemotherapy TPC.",

        "abstract": "Background: An earlier analysis of this phase 3 trial showed that the addition of a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor to endocrine therapy provided a greater benefit with regard to progression-free survival than endocrine therapy alone in premenopausal or perimenopausal patients with advanced hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Here we report the results of a protocol-specified interim analysis of the key secondary end point of overall survival. Methods: We randomly assigned patients to receive either ribociclib or placebo in addition to endocrine therapy (goserelin and either a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen). Overall survival was evaluated with the use of a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: A total of 672 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. There were 83 deaths among 335 patients (24.8%) in the ribociclib group and 109 deaths among 337 patients (32.3%) in the placebo group. The addition of ribociclib to endocrine therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than endocrine therapy alone. The estimated overall survival at 42 months was 70.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.5 to 76.0) in the ribociclib group and 46.0% (95% CI, 32.0 to 58.9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; P = 0.00973 by log-rank test). The survival benefit seen in the subgroup of 495 patients who received an aromatase inhibitor was consistent with that in the overall intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.98). The percentage of patients who received subsequent antineoplastic therapy was balanced between the groups (68.9% in the ribociclib group and 73.2% in the placebo group). The time from randomization to disease progression during receipt of second-line therapy or to death was also longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87). Conclusion: This trial showed significantly longer overall survival with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy than with endocrine therapy alone among patients with advanced hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. No new concerns regarding toxic effects emerged with longer follow-up. (Funded by Novartis; MONALEESA-7 ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "abstract": "Background: mutations occur in approximately 40% of patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The PI3Kα-specific inhibitor alpelisib has shown antitumor activity in early studies. Methods: In a randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared alpelisib (at a dose of 300 mg per day) plus fulvestrant (at a dose of 500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue   mutation status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, in the cohort with  -mutated cancer; progression-free survival was also analyzed in the cohort without  -mutated cancer. Secondary end points included overall response and safety. Results: A total of 572 patients underwent randomization, including 341 patients with confirmed tumor-tissue   mutations. In the cohort of patients with  -mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5 to 14.5) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.85; P<0.001); in the cohort without  -mutated cancer, the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.25; posterior probability of hazard ratio <1.00, 79.4%). Overall response among all the patients in the cohort without  -mutated cancer was greater with alpelisib-fulvestrant than with placebo-fulvestrant (26.6% vs. 12.8%); among patients with measurable disease in this cohort, the percentages were 35.7% and 16.2%, respectively. In the overall population, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hyperglycemia (36.6% in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group vs. 0.7% in the placebo-fulvestrant group) and rash (9.9% vs. 0.3%). Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7% of patients in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3% of those in the placebo-fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported. The percentages of patients who discontinued alpelisib and placebo owing to adverse events were 25.0% and 4.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with  -mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously.

        "abstract": "Background: In the OlympiAD study, olaparib was shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in patients with a germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAm) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC). We now report the planned final overall survival (OS) results, and describe the most common adverse events (AEs) to better understand olaparib tolerability in this population. Methods: OlympiAD, a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label study ( ), enrolled patients with a germline BRCAm and HER2-negative mBC who had received ≤2 lines of chemotherapy for mBC. Patients were randomized to olaparib tablets (300 mg bid) or predeclared TPC (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). OS and safety were secondary end points. Results: A total of 205 patients were randomized to olaparib and 97 to TPC. At 64% data maturity, median OS was 19.3 months with olaparib versus 17.1 months with TPC (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66-1.23; P = 0.513); median follow-up was 25.3 and 26.3 months, respectively. HR for OS with olaparib versus TPC in prespecified subgroups were: prior chemotherapy for mBC [no (first-line setting): 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; yes (second/third-line): 1.13, 0.79-1.64]; receptor status (triple negative: 0.93, 0.62-1.43; hormone receptor positive: 0.86, 0.55-1.36); prior platinum (yes: 0.83, 0.49-1.45; no: 0.91, 0.64-1.33). Adverse events during olaparib treatment were generally low grade and manageable by supportive treatment or dose modification. There was a low rate of treatment discontinuation (4.9%), and the risk of developing anemia did not increase with extended olaparib exposure. Conclusion: While there was no statistically significant improvement in OS with olaparib compared to TPC, there was the possibility of meaningful OS benefit among patients who had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Olaparib was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity during extended exposure. Please see the article online for additional video content.",

        "abstract": "Background: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment has changed substantially over time, but we do not know whether survival post-metastasis has improved at the population level. Methods: We searched for studies of MBC patients that reported survival after metastasis in at least two time periods between 1970 and the present. We used meta-regression models to test for survival improvement over time in four disease groups: recurrent, recurrent estrogen (ER)-positive, recurrent ER-negative, and de novo stage IV. We performed sensitivity analyses based on bias in some studies that could lead earlier cohorts to include more aggressive cancers. Results: There were 15 studies of recurrent MBC (N = 18 678 patients; 3073 ER-positive and 1239 ER-negative); meta-regression showed no survival improvement among patients recurring between 1980 and 1990, but median survival increased from 21 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 18 to 25) months to 38 (95% CI = 31 to 47) months from 1990 to 2010. For ER-positive MBC patients, median survival increased during 1990-2010 from 32 (95% CI = 23 to 43) to 57 (95% CI = 37 to 87) months, and for ER-negative MBC patients from 14 (95% CI = 11 to 19) to 33 (95% CI = 21 to 51) months. Among eight studies (N = 35 831) of de novo stage IV MBC, median survival increased during 1990-2010 from 20 (95% CI = 16 to 24) to 31 (95% CI = 24 to 39) months. Results did not change in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: By bridging studies over time, we demonstrated improvements in survival for recurrent and de novo stage IV MBC overall and across ER-defined subtypes since 1990. These results can inform patient-doctor discussions about MBC prognosis and therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative (hormone-receptor-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor outcomes. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel may enhance the anticancer activity of atezolizumab. Methods: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel or placebo plus nab-paclitaxel; patients continued the intervention until disease progression or an unacceptable level of toxic effects occurred. Stratification factors were the receipt or nonreceipt of neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane therapy, the presence or absence of liver metastases at baseline, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at baseline (positive vs. negative). The two primary end points were progression-free survival (in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1-positive subgroup) and overall survival (tested in the intention-to-treat population; if the finding was significant, then it would be tested in the PD-L1-positive subgroup). Results: Each group included 451 patients (median follow-up, 12.9 months). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel, as compared with 5.5 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.5 months and 5.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.78; P<0.001). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median overall survival was 21.3 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 17.6 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.02; P=0.08); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median overall survival was 25.0 months and 15.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.86). No new adverse effects were identified. Adverse events that led to the discontinuation of any agent occurred in 15.9% of the patients who received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and in 8.2% of those who received placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Conclusion: Atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in both the intention-to-treat population and the PD-L1-positive subgroup.

        "abstract": "Background: In order to facilitate implementation of precision medicine in clinical management of cancer, there is a need to harmonise and standardise the reporting and interpretation of clinically relevant genomics data. Methods: The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group (TR and PM WG) launched a collaborative project to propose a classification system for molecular aberrations based on the evidence available supporting their value as clinical targets. A group of experts from several institutions was assembled to review available evidence, reach a consensus on grading criteria and present a classification system. This was then reviewed, amended and finally approved by the ESMO TR and PM WG and the ESMO leadership. Results: This first version of the ESMO Scale of Clinical Actionability for molecular Targets (ESCAT) defines six levels of clinical evidence for molecular targets according to the implications for patient management: tier I, targets ready for implementation in routine clinical decisions; tier II, investigational targets that likely define a patient population that benefits from a targeted drug but additional data are needed; tier III, clinical benefit previously demonstrated in other tumour types or for similar molecular targets; tier IV, preclinical evidence of actionability; tier V, evidence supporting co-targeting approaches; and tier X, lack of evidence for actionability. Conclusion: The ESCAT defines clinical evidence-based criteria to prioritise genomic alterations as markers to select patients for targeted therapies. This classification system aims to offer a common language for all the relevant stakeholders in cancer medicine and drug development.",

Methods: Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive talazoparib or PCT. PROs were assessed at day 1 (baseline), the start of each treatment cycle (every 3 weeks), and at the end of treatment, using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-30) and its breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23. Prespecified exploratory analyses included a longitudinal mixed-effect model comparing treatment arms and a time to definitive clinically meaningful deterioration (TTD) analysis carried out in the global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), and all functional and symptom scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and -BR23 questionnaires. Between-arm TTD comparisons were made using a stratified log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Baseline scores were similar between arms. Statistically significant estimated overall improvement from baseline in GHS/QoL was seen for talazoparib compared with statistically significant deterioration for PCT {3.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 4.8] versus -5.4 [95% CI -8.8, -2.0]; between arms, P < 0.0001}. A statistically significant greater delay was observed in TTD in GHS/QoL, favoring talazoparib over PCT [hazard ratio, 0.38 (95% CI 0.26, 0.55; median, 24.3 versus 6.3 months, respectively; P < 0.0001)]. A statistically significant overall change and a statistically significant delay in TTD, all favoring talazoparib, were also observed in multiple functions and symptoms. Conclusion: Patients who received talazoparib had significant overall improvements and significant delay in TTD in multiple cancer-related and breast cancer-specific symptoms, functions, and GHS/QoL.",

Methods: The PERTAIN trial ( ) is an ongoing randomized, open-label, multicenter-80 sites and eight countries-phase II trial. Patients have HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive MBC/LABC and no prior systemic therapy with the exception of endocrine. Random assignment was 1:1 to intravenous pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks), and oral anastrozole (1 mg every day) or letrozole (2.5 mg every day), or trastuzumab and an AI. Induction intravenous docetaxel every 3 weeks or paclitaxel every week could be administered for 18 to 24 weeks at the investigator's discretion (decided before but given after random assignment). Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Patients were stratified by whether they received induction chemotherapy and their time since adjuvant hormone therapy. Results: One hundred twenty-nine patients were randomly assigned per arm (February 2012 to October 2014; intent-to-treat populations); 75 in one arm and 71 in the other were chosen to receive induction chemotherapy. Stratified median PFS was 18.89 months (95% CI, 14.09 to 27.66 months) in the pertuzumab plus trastuzumab arm and 15.80 months (95% CI, 11.04 to 18.56 months) in the trastuzumab arm (stratified hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89; P = .0070).

        "abstract": "Background: Tucatinib is a potent and selective oral HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with the potential to provide a well tolerated new treatment option for patients whose disease has progressed on currently available therapies. We aimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with or without brain metastases. Methods: In this non-randomised, open-label, phase 1b trial done in five sites in the USA, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive progressive breast cancer who had been previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine. Eligible patients required HER2-positivity assessed locally, evaluable lesions as defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Tucatinib was administered twice a day in conjunction with capecitabine 1000 mg/m  orally twice a day for 14 days of a 21-day cycle, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously once every 21 days, or both. A modified 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, starting with tucatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumab, and subsequently evaluating the triplet combination. The primary endpoint was to establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of tucatinib, evaluated by toxicity assessments. Efficacy was assessed in all patients by contrast CT of the body. Analyses included all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between Jan 15, 2014, and Dec 15, 2015, 60 patients were enrolled and treated. The current report is from mature data as of June 30, 2017. The tucatinib recommended phase 2 dose was determined to be 300 mg orally twice a day, equivalent to single-agent maximum tolerated dose. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no drug-drug interaction with capecitabine. Adverse events seen at the recommended phase 2 dose regardless of causality, grade, and treatment group included diarrhoea (35 [67%] of 52 patients), nausea (31 [60%] patients), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (23 [44%] patients), fatigue (20 [38%] patients), and vomiting (20 [38%] patients). In all patients, treatment-related toxicities of grade 3 and worse included fatigue (five [8%] patients), diarrhoea (four [7%] patients), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (four [7%] patients). No treatment-related deaths were reported. The proportion of patients with measurable disease achieving objective response was 83% (five of six patients) in the combination of tucatinib with capecitabine, 40% (six of 15 patients) in the combination of tucatinib with trastuzumab, and 61% (14 of 23 patients) in the combination of tucatinib with both capecitabine and trastuzumab. Conclusion: Tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab had acceptable toxicity and showed preliminary anti-tumour activity. Validation of the current study results will be determined in the double-blinded randomised study, HER2CLIMB (ONT-380-206;  ).",

        "abstract": "Background: In MONALEESA-2, ribociclib plus letrozole showed improved progression-free survival compared with letrozole alone as first-line treatment for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer. MONALEESA-7 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with advanced, HR-positive breast cancer. Methods: This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at 188 centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were premenopausal women aged 18-59 years who had histologically or cytologically confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria, or at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion; and had not received previous treatment with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors. Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting was permitted, as was up to one line of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via interactive response technology to receive oral ribociclib (600 mg/day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) or matching placebo with either oral tamoxifen (20 mg daily) or a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (letrozole 2·5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg, both oral, daily), all with goserelin (3·6 mg administered subcutaneously on day 1 of every 28-day cycle). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. MONALEESA-7 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,   and is ongoing, but no longer enrolling patients. Results: Between Dec 17, 2014, and Aug 1, 2016, 672 patients were randomly assigned: 335 to the ribociclib group and 337 to the placebo group. Per investigator's assessment, median progression-free survival was 23·8 months (95% CI 19·2-not reached) in the ribociclib group compared with 13·0 months (11·0-16·4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·44-0·69; p<0·0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients in either group were neutropenia (203 [61%] of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 12 [4%] of 337 in the placebo group) and leucopenia (48 [14%] and four [1%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 60 (18%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 39 (12%) of 337 in the placebo group, of which 15 (4%) and six (2%), respectively, were attributed to the study regimen. 12 (4%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and ten (3%) of 337 in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 11 deaths occurred (five [1%] in the ribociclib group and six [2%] in the placebo group) during or within 30 days after treatment, most of which were due to progression of the underlying breast cancer (three [1%] and six [2%]). The remaining two deaths in the ribociclib group were due to an intracranial haemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient, and a pre-existing wound haemorrhage in another patient. Conclusion: Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy improved progression-free survival compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy, and had a manageable safety profile in patients with premenopausal, HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer. The combination could represent a new first-line treatment option for these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 predispose individuals to breast cancer (termed germline-mutated BRCA1/2 breast cancer, gBRCA-BC) by impairing homologous recombination (HR) and causing genomic instability. HR also repairs DNA lesions caused by platinum agents and PARP inhibitors. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) harbor subpopulations with BRCA1/2 mutations, hypothesized to be especially platinum-sensitive. Cancers in putative 'BRCAness' subgroups-tumors with BRCA1 methylation; low levels of BRCA1 mRNA (BRCA1 mRNA-low); or mutational signatures for HR deficiency and those with basal phenotypes-may also be sensitive to platinum. We assessed the efficacy of carboplatin and another mechanistically distinct therapy, docetaxel, in a phase 3 trial in subjects with unselected advanced TNBC. A prespecified protocol enabled biomarker-treatment interaction analyses in gBRCA-BC and BRCAness subgroups. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). In the unselected population (376 subjects; 188 carboplatin, 188 docetaxel), carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR, 31.4% versus 34.0%, respectively; P = 0.66). In contrast, in subjects with gBRCA-BC, carboplatin had double the ORR of docetaxel (68% versus 33%, respectively; biomarker, treatment interaction P = 0.01). Such benefit was not observed for subjects with BRCA1 methylation, BRCA1 mRNA-low tumors or a high score in a Myriad HRD assay. Significant interaction between treatment and the basal-like subtype was driven by high docetaxel response in the nonbasal subgroup. We conclude that patients with advanced TNBC benefit from characterization of BRCA1/2 mutations, but not BRCA1 methylation or Myriad HRD analyses, to inform choices on platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, gene expression analysis of basal-like cancers may also influence treatment selection.",

        "abstract": "Background: In 2015, the second cycle of the CONCORD programme established global surveillance of cancer survival as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems and to inform global policy on cancer control. CONCORD-3 updates the worldwide surveillance of cancer survival to 2014. Methods: CONCORD-3 includes individual records for 37·5 million patients diagnosed with cancer during the 15-year period 2000-14. Data were provided by 322 population-based cancer registries in 71 countries and territories, 47 of which provided data with 100% population coverage. The study includes 18 cancers or groups of cancers: oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, prostate, and melanoma of the skin in adults, and brain tumours, leukaemias, and lymphomas in both adults and children. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were rectified by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Results: For most cancers, 5-year net survival remains among the highest in the world in the USA and Canada, in Australia and New Zealand, and in Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. For many cancers, Denmark is closing the survival gap with the other Nordic countries. Survival trends are generally increasing, even for some of the more lethal cancers: in some countries, survival has increased by up to 5% for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and lung. For women diagnosed during 2010-14, 5-year survival for breast cancer is now 89·5% in Australia and 90·2% in the USA, but international differences remain very wide, with levels as low as 66·1% in India. For gastrointestinal cancers, the highest levels of 5-year survival are seen in southeast Asia: in South Korea for cancers of the stomach (68·9%), colon (71·8%), and rectum (71·1%); in Japan for oesophageal cancer (36·0%); and in Taiwan for liver cancer (27·9%). By contrast, in the same world region, survival is generally lower than elsewhere for melanoma of the skin (59·9% in South Korea, 52·1% in Taiwan, and 49·6% in China), and for both lymphoid malignancies (52·5%, 50·5%, and 38·3%) and myeloid malignancies (45·9%, 33·4%, and 24·8%). For children diagnosed during 2010-14, 5-year survival for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ranged from 49·8% in Ecuador to 95·2% in Finland. 5-year survival from brain tumours in children is higher than for adults but the global range is very wide (from 28·9% in Brazil to nearly 80% in Sweden and Denmark). Conclusion: The CONCORD programme enables timely comparisons of the overall effectiveness of health systems in providing care for 18 cancers that collectively represent 75% of all cancers diagnosed worldwide every year. It contributes to the evidence base for global policy on cancer control. Since 2017, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has used findings from the CONCORD programme as the official benchmark of cancer survival, among their indicators of the quality of health care in 48 countries worldwide. Governments must recognise population-based cancer registries as key policy tools that can be used to evaluate both the impact of cancer prevention strategies and the effectiveness of health systems for all patients diagnosed with cancer.",

Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade. The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy. Methods Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI. Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI. Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety. Results Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P = .0064). Consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups. Overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall survival also favored LAP + TRAS + AI. The median PFS with LAP + AI versus TRAS + AI was 8.3 versus 5.7 months (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P = .0361). Common adverse events (AEs; ≥ 15%) with LAP + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, and LAP + AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2. Serious AEs were reported similarly across the three groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP + TRAS + AI. Conclusion Dual HER2 blockade with LAP + TRAS + AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS + AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC. This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",

Methods: A retrospective cohort study, 1990-2010, with follow up through 2015 of dnMBC patients (stage IV at diagnosis) and rMBC patients with subsequent distant metastatic recurrence (stage I-III initial diagnosis) [dnMBC = 247, rMBC = 911)]. Analysis included Chi squared tests of categorical variables, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional adjusted hazard ratios (HzR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Disease specific survival (DSS) was time from diagnosis or distant recurrence to BC death. Results: Over time, 1990-1998, 1999-2004, and 2005-2010, dnMBC incidence was constant (3%) and rMBC incidence decreased [18% to 7% (p < 0.001)] with no change in dnMBC hormone receptor (HR) or her2-neu (HER2) status but a decrease in rMBC HER2-positive cases and increase in triple negative breast cancer (HR-negative/HER2-negative) (p = 0.049). Five-year dnMBC DSS was 44% vs. 21% for rMBC (p < 0.001). Five-year dnMBC DSS improved over time [28% to 55% (p = 0.008)] and rMBC worsened [23% to 13%, p = 0.065)]. Worse DSS was associated with HR-negative status (HzR = 1.63; 1.41, 1.89), rMBC (HzR = 1.88; 1.58, 2.23), older age (70 +) (HzR = 1.88; 1.58, 2.24), > 1 distant metastases (HzR 1.39; 1.20, 1.62), and visceral dominant disease (HzR 1.22; 1.05, 1.43). After 1998, HER2-positive disease was associated with better DSS (HzR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56, 0.93). Conclusion: Factors associated with the widening survival gap and non-equivalence between dnMBC and rMBC and decreased rMBC incidence warrant further study.",

Methods MONARCH 3 is a double-blind, randomized phase III study of abemaciclib or placebo plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had no prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Patients received abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily continuous schedule) plus either 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily. The primary objective was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included response evaluation and safety. A planned interim analysis occurred after 189 events. Results Median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the abemaciclib arm (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.72; P = .000021; median: not reached in the abemaciclib arm, 14.7 months in the placebo arm). In patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate was 59% in the abemaciclib arm and 44% in the placebo arm ( P = .004). In the abemaciclib arm, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse effect (81.3%) but was mainly grade 1 (44.6%).

        "abstract": "Background: The ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) version 1.0 (v1.0) was published in May 2015 and was the first version of a validated and reproducible tool to assess the magnitude of clinical benefit from new cancer therapies. The ESMO-MCBS was designed to be a dynamic tool with planned revisions and updates based upon recognition of expanding needs and shortcomings identified since the last review. Methods: The revision process for the ESMO-MCBS incorporates a nine-step process: Careful review of critiques and suggestions, and identification of problems in the application of v1.0; Identification of shortcomings for revision in the upcoming version; Proposal and evaluation of solutions to address identified shortcomings; Field testing of solutions; Preparation of a near-final revised version for peer review for reasonableness by members of the ESMO Faculty and Guidelines Committee; Amendments based on peer review for reasonableness; Near-final review by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and the ESMO Executive Board; Final amendments; Final review and approval by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and the ESMO Executive Board. Results: Twelve issues for revision or amendment were proposed for consideration; proposed amendments were formulated for eight identified shortcomings. The proposed amendments are classified as either structural, technical, immunotherapy triggered or nuanced. All amendments were field tested in a wide range of studies comparing scores generated with ESMO-MCBS v1.0 and version 1.1 (v1.1). Conclusion: ESMO-MCBS v1.1 incorporates 10 revisions and will allow for scoring of single-arm studies. Scoring remains very stable; revisions in v1.1 alter the scores of only 12 out of 118 comparative studies and facilitate scoring for single-arm studies.",

MONARCH 1 was a phase II single-arm open-label study. Women with HR /HER2  MBC who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy and had 1 or 2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting were eligible. Abemaciclib 200 mg was administered orally on a continuous schedule every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of MONARCH 1 was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). Other endpoints included clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).  Patients (  = 132) had a median of 3 (range, 1-8) lines of prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting, 90.2% had visceral disease, and 50.8% had ≥3 metastatic sites. At the 12-month final analysis, the primary objective of confirmed objective response rate was 19.7% (95% CI, 13.3-27.5; 15% not excluded); clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD≥6 months) was 42.4%, median progression-free survival was 6.0 months, and median overall survival was 17.7 months. The most common treatment-emergent AEs of any grade were diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea; discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent (7.6%).  In this poor-prognosis, heavily pretreated population with refractory HR /HER2  metastatic breast cancer, continuous dosing of single-agent abemaciciclib was well tolerated and exhibited promising clinical activity.  .",

        "abstract": "Background: Systemic therapies (ATHs) in early breast cancer have improved the survival of breast cancer (BC) patients in recent decades. The magnitude of the changes in overall, metastasis-free (MFS) and post-metastatic (PMS) survival and in the metastasis (MET) pattern will be described. Methods: We analysed 60,227 patients with a diagnosis of T-N-M0 BC between 1978 and 2013 and 11,983 patients with metastases (MET) in the Munich Cancer Registry. Patients will be divided into four time periods to identify relationships between BC and METs. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the impact of the BC subtype and MET status on survival with the time periods as surrogate markers for ATH evolution. Results: During the observation period, 5-year relative survival has improved from 80.3 to 93.6% with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.54 (P < 0.0001). Successful implementation of ATH has changed the MET pattern. The percentage of liver and CNS METs has more than doubled, the rate of lung METs remains stable, and the rate of bone METs has been reduced by approximately 50%. MFS has been prolonged with a hazard ratio 0.75 (P < 0.0001), but PMS has declined (hazard ratio 1.36; P < 0.0001); however, effects of adjuvant and palliative treatments cannot be separated. These results do not contradict improvements in advanced BC and do not suggest alterations of MET tumour biology by ATH. Conclusion: Over the past three decades, ATHs have dramatically improved patient survival after BC diagnosis-most likely, by eradicating prevalent micro-METs; as a result, the MET pattern has changed. Eradicating only a portion of the first METs results in delaying the onset of subsequent MET, which leads to an apparently paradoxical effect: an extension of the MET-free interval and a reduction in PMS.",

        "abstract": "Background: Stomatitis is a class effect associated with the inhibition of mTOR and is associated with everolimus therapy for breast cancer. Topical steroids might reduce stomatitis incidence and severity, and the need for dose reductions and interruptions of everolimus. Anecdotal use of topical steroid oral prophylaxis has been reported in patients with breast cancer. We aimed to assess dexamethasone-based mouthwash for prevention of stomatitis in patients with breast cancer. Methods: This US-based, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 prevention study enrolled women aged 18 years and older with postmenopausal status who had histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Beginning on day 1 of cycle 1, patients received everolimus 10 mg plus exemestane 25 mg daily, with 10 mL of alcohol-free dexamethasone 0·5 mg per 5 mL oral solution (swish for 2 min and spit, four times daily for 8 weeks). After 8 weeks, dexamethasone mouthwash could be continued for up to eight additional weeks at the discretion of the clinician and patient. The primary endpoint was incidence of grade 2 or worse stomatitis by 8 weeks assessed in the full analysis set (patients who received at least one dose of everolimus and exemestane and at least one confirmed dose of dexamethasone mouthwash) versus historical controls from the BOLERO-2 trial (everolimus and exemestane treatment in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who were not given dexamethasone mouthwash for prevention of stomatitis). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between May 28, 2014, and Oct 8, 2015, we enrolled 92 women; 85 were evaluable for efficacy. By 8 weeks, the incidence of grade 2 or worse stomatitis was two (2%) of 85 patients (95% CI 0·29-8·24), versus 159 (33%) of 482 patients (95% CI 28·8-37·4) for the duration of the BOLERO-2 study. Overall, 83 (90%) of 92 patients had at least one adverse event. The most frequently reported grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the safety set were hyperglycaemia (seven [8%] of 92 patients), rash (four [4%]), and dyspnoea (three [3%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 20 (22%) patients; six (7%) were deemed treatment related, with dyspnoea (three [3%]) and pneumonia (two [2%]) reported most frequently. 12 (13%) of 92 patients had adverse events suspected to be related to treatment that led to discontinuation of everolimus and exemestane (the most common were rash, hyperglycaemia, and stomatitis, which each affected two [2%] patients). Conclusion: Prophylactic use of dexamethasone oral solution substantially reduced the incidence and severity of stomatitis in patients receiving everolimus and exemestane and could be a new standard of oral care for patients receiving everolimus and exemestane therapy.",

We performed a phase 3 study that was designed to confirm and expand the efficacy and safety data for palbociclib plus letrozole for this indication. Methods: In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 666 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, who had not had prior treatment for advanced disease, to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigators; secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, clinical benefit response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetic effects, and safety. Results: The median progression-free survival was 24.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to not estimable) in the palbociclib-letrozole group, as compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9 to 17.1) in the placebo-letrozole group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (occurring in 66.4% of the patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group vs. 1.4% in the placebo-letrozole group), leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in none of the patients in the placebo-letrozole group. Permanent discontinuation of any study treatment as a result of adverse events occurred in 43 patients (9.7%) in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in 13 patients (5.9%) in the placebo-letrozole group. Conclusion: Among patients with previously untreated ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, palbociclib combined with letrozole resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than that with letrozole alone, although the rates of myelotoxic effects were higher with palbociclib-letrozole.

Methods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy for advanced disease. We randomly assigned the patients to receive either ribociclib (600 mg per day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) plus letrozole (2.5 mg per day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, overall response rate, and safety. A preplanned interim analysis was performed on January 29, 2016, after 243 patients had disease progression or died. Prespecified criteria for superiority required a hazard ratio of 0.56 or less with P<1.29×10 . Results: The duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.72; P=3.29×10  for superiority). The median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months. After 18 months, the progression-free survival rate was 63.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6 to 70.3) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8 to 49.5) in the placebo group. In patients with measurable disease at baseline, the overall response rate was 52.7% and 37.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were reported in more than 10% of the patients in either group were neutropenia (59.3% in the ribociclib group vs. 0.9% in the placebo group) and leukopenia (21.0% vs. 0.6%); the rates of discontinuation because of adverse events were 7.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Among patients receiving initial systemic treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, the duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer among those receiving ribociclib plus letrozole than among those receiving placebo plus letrozole, with a higher rate of myelosuppression in the ribociclib group.

        "abstract": "Background: As a means to measure quantifiable signs, symptoms, and impacts of a disease or its treatment, patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments can be applied to numerous settings, including use in drug development to support labeling claims. This research summarizes the use of PROs in trials for 16 commonly used regulatory approved treatments for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Methods: For each treatment (n = 16), a literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. The primary criterion for selection was the report of studies that used PROs to evaluate treatment benefit and/or toxicity in advanced or metastatic breast cancer. From this, a sub-set of articles for each treatment were selected for full-text review where PRO-related information was extracted and summarized. Results: The searches yielded 1727 publications. Following abstract review, 1702 were excluded because they failed to meet criteria, or were duplicates or less relevant for PRO information reported. Thus, 25 articles were reviewed in detail for this evaluation. Eleven PRO instruments were identified from these publications. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core (EORTC QLQ-C30) was utilized the most frequently (n = 13, 52.0%). Most publications reported PROs positioned as secondary endpoints (n = 20, 80.0%); described some of the statistical analyses applied to PRO data (n = 21, 84.0%); and specified PRO results (n = 23, 92.0%). Conclusion: While several of the publications provided some information on how PROs were utilized, many did not describe details for PRO administration, scoring, analyses, and results interpretation. While it is encouraging that PROs are often used in clinical trials for patients with metastatic breast cancer, they are not commonly used to support endpoints that establish the basis for label claims. Because they yield direct insight into the patient experience of a condition, PROs may be used to provide a more comprehensive perspective of the benefits and risks from treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: The optimal frequency of monitoring patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is unknown; however, data suggest that intensive monitoring does not improve outcomes. We performed a population-based analysis to evaluate patterns and predictors of extreme use of disease-monitoring tests (serum tumor markers [STMs] and radiographic imaging) among women with MBC. Methods: The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify women with MBC diagnosed from 2002 to 2011 who underwent disease monitoring. Billing dates of STMs (carcinoembryonic antigen and/or cancer antigen 15-3/cancer antigen 27.29) and imaging tests (computed tomography and/or positron emission tomography) were recorded; if more than one STM or imaging test were completed on the same day, they were counted once. We defined extreme use as > 12 STM and/or more than four radiographic imaging tests in a 12-month period. Multivariable analysis was used to identify factors associated with extreme use. In extreme users, total health care costs and end-of-life health care utilization were compared with the rest of the study population. Results: We identified 2,460 eligible patients. Of these, 924 (37.6%) were extreme users of disease-monitoring tests. Factors significantly associated with extreme use were hormone receptor-negative MBC (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.08), history of a positron emission tomography scan (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.40 to 3.55), and more frequent oncology office visits (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.49 to 3.96). Medical costs per year were 59.2% higher in extreme users. Extreme users were more likely to use emergency department and hospice services at the end of life. Conclusion: Despite an unknown clinical benefit, approximately one third of elderly women with MBC were extreme users of disease-monitoring tests. Higher use of disease-monitoring tests was associated with higher total health care costs. Efforts to understand the optimal frequency of monitoring are needed to inform clinical practice.",

Identification of patients most suitable for the addition of palbociclib to endocrine therapy after tumour recurrence is crucial for treatment optimisation in metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to confirm our earlier findings with this extended follow-up and show our results for subgroup and biomarker analyses. Methods: In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 study, women aged 18 years or older with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that had progressed on previous endocrine therapy were stratified by sensitivity to previous hormonal therapy, menopausal status, and presence of visceral metastasis at 144 centres in 17 countries. Eligible patients-ie, any menopausal status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, measurable disease or bone disease only, and disease relapse or progression after previous endocrine therapy for advanced disease during treatment or within 12 months of completion of adjuvant therapy-were randomly assigned (2:1) via a centralised interactive web-based and voice-based randomisation system to receive oral palbociclib (125 mg daily for 3 weeks followed by a week off over 28-day cycles) plus 500 mg fulvestrant (intramuscular injection on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1; then on day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. We also assessed endocrine therapy resistance by clinical parameters, quantitative hormone-receptor expression, and tumour PIK3CA mutational status in circulating DNA at baseline. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between Oct 7, 2013, and Aug 26, 2014, 521 patients were randomly assigned, 347 to fulvestrant plus palbociclib and 174 to fulvestrant plus placebo. Study enrolment is closed and overall survival follow-up is in progress. By March 16, 2015, 259 progression-free-survival events had occurred (145 in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 114 in the fulvestrant plus placebo group); median follow-up was 8·9 months (IQR 8·7-9·2). Median progression-free survival was 9·5 months (95% CI 9·2-11·0) in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 4·6 months (3·5-5·6) in the fulvestrant plus placebo group (hazard ratio 0·46, 95% CI 0·36-0·59, p<0·0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 251 (73%) of 345 patients in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 38 (22%) of 172 patients in the fulvestrant plus placebo group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (223 [65%] in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and one [1%] in the fulvestrant plus placebo group), anaemia (ten [3%] and three [2%]), and leucopenia (95 [28%] and two [1%]). Serious adverse events (all causalities) occurred in 44 patients (13%) of 345 in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 30 (17%) of 172 patients in the fulvestrant plus placebo group. PIK3CA mutation was detected in the plasma DNA of 129 (33%) of 395 patients for whom these data were available. Neither PIK3CA status nor hormone-receptor expression level significantly affected treatment response. Conclusion: Fulvestrant plus palbociclib was associated with significant and consistent improvement in progression-free survival compared with fulvestrant plus placebo, irrespective of the degree of endocrine resistance, hormone-receptor expression level, and PIK3CA mutational status. The combination could be considered as a therapeutic option for patients with recurrent hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on previous endocrine therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: To provide recommendations on the appropriate use of breast tumor biomarker assay results to guide decisions on systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Methods: A literature search and prospectively defined study selection identified systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective-retrospective studies, and prospective comparative observational studies published from 2006 through September 2014. Results: The literature search revealed 17 articles that met criteria for further review: 11 studies reporting discordances between primary tumors and metastases in expression of hormone receptors or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), one RCT that addressed the use of a biomarker to decide whether to change or continue a treatment regimen, and five prospective-retrospective studies that evaluated the clinical utility of biomarkers. Conclusion: In patients with accessible metastases, biopsy for confirmation of disease process and retesting of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status should be offered, but evidence is lacking to determine whether changing anticancer treatment on the basis of change in receptor status affects clinical outcomes. With discordance of results between primary and metastatic tissues, the Panel consensus is to use preferentially the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status of the metastasis to direct therapy if supported by the clinical scenario and patient's goals for care. Carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 15-3, and cancer antigen 27-29 may be used as adjunctive assessments, but not alone, to contribute to decisions regarding therapy. Recommendations for tumor rebiopsy and use of circulating tumor markers are based on clinical experience and Panel informal consensus in the absence of studies designed to evaluate the clinical utility of the markers. As such, it is also reasonable for clinicians to not use these markers as adjunctive assessments.",

Among 159 citations reviewed, 17 single-institution, non-randomized, observational studies met our inclusion criteria. Several studies demonstrate that changes in PET/CT standard uptake values are associated with changes in tumor volume as determined by bone scan, MRI, and/or CT. However, no studies evaluated comparative test performance between modalities or determined relationships between imaging findings and subsequent clinical decisions. Evidence for imaging's effectiveness in determining treatment response among metastatic breast cancer patients is limited.

The overall survival (OS) analysis is presented here. Methods: BOLERO-2 is a phase III, double-blind, randomized international trial comparing EVE 10 mg/day plus EXE 25 mg/day versus placebo (PBO) + EXE 25 mg/day in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer with prior exposure to NSAIs. The primary end point was PFS by local investigator assessment; OS was a key secondary end point. Results: At the time of data cutoff (3 October 2013), 410 deaths had occurred and 13 patients remained on treatment. Median OS in patients receiving EVE + EXE was 31.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 28.0-34.6 months] compared with 26.6 months (95% CI 22.6-33.1 months) in patients receiving PBO + EXE (hazard ratio = 0.89; 95% CI 0.73-1.10; log-rank P = 0.14). Poststudy treatments were received by 84% of patients in the EVE + EXE arm versus 90% of patients in the PBO + EXE arm. Types of poststudy therapies were balanced across arms, except for chemotherapy (53% EVE + EXE versus 63% PBO + EXE). No new safety concerns were identified. Conclusion: In BOLERO-2, adding EVE to EXE did not confer a statistically significant improvement in the secondary end point OS despite producing a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the primary end point, PFS (4.6-months prolongation in median PFS; P < 0.0001). Ongoing translational research should further refine the benefit of mTOR inhibition and related pathways in this treatment setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients with progressive disease after two or more HER2-directed regimens for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer have few effective therapeutic options. We aimed to compare trastuzumab emtansine, an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the cytotoxic agent DM1 linked to trastuzumab, with treatment of physician's choice in this population of patients. Methods: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial took place in medical centres in 22 countries across Europe, North America, South America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients (≥18 years, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2) with progressive HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who had received two or more HER2-directed regimens in the advanced setting, including trastuzumab and lapatinib, and previous taxane therapy in any setting, were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to trastuzumab emtansine (3·6 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days) or physician's choice using a permuted block randomisation scheme by an interactive voice and web response system. Patients were stratified according to world region (USA vs western Europe vs other), number of previous regimens (excluding single-agent hormonal therapy) for the treatment of advanced disease (two to three vs more than three), and presence of visceral disease (any vs none). Coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report the final PFS analysis and the first interim overall survival analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: From Sept 14, 2011, to Nov 19, 2012, 602 patients were randomly assigned (404 to trastuzumab emtansine and 198 to physician's choice). At data cutoff (Feb 11, 2013), 44 patients assigned to physician's choice had crossed over to trastuzumab emtansine. After a median follow-up of 7·2 months (IQR 5·0-10·1 months) in the trastuzumab emtansine group and 6·5 months (IQR 4·1-9·7) in the physician's choice group, 219 (54%) patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group and 129 (65%) of patients in the physician's choice group had PFS events. PFS was significantly improved with trastuzumab emtansine compared with physician's choice (median 6·2 months [95% CI 5·59-6·87] vs 3·3 months [2·89-4·14]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·528 [0·422-0·661]; p<0·0001). Interim overall survival analysis showed a trend favouring trastuzumab emtansine (stratified HR 0·552 [95% CI 0·369-0·826]; p=0·0034), but the stopping boundary was not crossed. A lower incidence of grade 3 or worse adverse events was reported with trastuzumab emtansine than with physician's choice (130 events [32%] in 403 patients vs 80 events [43%] in 184 patients). Neutropenia (ten [2%] vs 29 [16%]), diarrhoea (three [<1%] vs eight [4%]), and febrile neutropenia (one [<1%] vs seven [4%]) were grade 3 or worse adverse events that were more common in the physician's choice group than in the trastuzumab emtansine group. Thrombocytopenia (19 [5%] vs three [2%]) was the grade 3 or worse adverse event that was more common in the trastuzumab emtansine group. 74 (18%) patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group and 38 (21%) in the physician's choice group reported a serious adverse event. Conclusion: Trastuzumab emtansine should be considered as a new standard for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who have previously received trastuzumab and lapatinib.",

        "abstract": "Background: Bevacizumab has consistently demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate when combined with first-line chemotherapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC). However, the lack of a significant overall survival (OS) difference continues to attract debate, and identification of patients deriving greatest benefit from bevacizumab remains elusive. Methods: Individual patient data from three randomised phase III trials in the first-line HER2-negative mBC setting were analysed, focusing specifically on efficacy in poor-prognosis patients. Results: The meta-analysis (n = 2447) demonstrated a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.71; median 9.2 months with bevacizumab versus 6.7 months with non-bevacizumab therapy) and response rate of 49% versus 32%, respectively. The OS HR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.86-1.08); median 26.7 versus 26.4 months, respectively. In patients with triple-negative mBC, the HRs for PFS and OS were 0.63 (95% CI 0.52-0.76) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.79-1.16), respectively. Median PFS was 8.1 months with bevacizumab versus 5.4 months with chemotherapy alone, median OS was 18.9 versus 17.5 months, respectively, and 1-year OS rates were 71% versus 65%. Conclusion: Bevacizumab improves efficacy, including 1-year OS rates, both overall and in subgroups of poor-prognosis patients with limited treatment options.",

        "abstract": "Background: The combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab resulted in a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 50% in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer whose disease progressed during prior trastuzumab-based therapy. To define whether this previously observed encouraging activity was a result of the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab or of pertuzumab alone, we recruited a third cohort of patients who received pertuzumab without trastuzumab. We then investigated the impact of reintroducing trastuzumab to patients whose disease progressed on pertuzumab monotherapy. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with HER2-positive breast cancer whose disease progressed during prior trastuzumab-based therapy received pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks) until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Seventeen patients with disease progression continued to receive pertuzumab (at the same dose), with the addition of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose and then 2 mg/kg weekly or 8 mg/kg loading dose and then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Results: All 29 patients enrolled for pertuzumab monotherapy experienced disease progression. The objective response rate (ORR) and CBR were 3.4% and 10.3%, respectively, during pertuzumab monotherapy. With the addition of trastuzumab, the ORR and CBR were 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively. Progression-free survival was longer with combination therapy than pertuzumab monotherapy (17.4 v 7.1 weeks, respectively). Treatment was well tolerated with minimal cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion: Although pertuzumab has some activity in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that progressed during therapy with trastuzumab, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab seems to be more active than monotherapy.",

In early studies, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus added to endocrine therapy showed antitumor activity. Methods: In this phase 3, randomized trial, we compared everolimus and exemestane versus exemestane and placebo (randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio) in 724 patients with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease (or both). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included survival, response rate, and safety. A preplanned interim analysis was performed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee after 359 progression-free survival events were observed. Results: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two study groups. The median age was 62 years, 56% had visceral involvement, and 84% had hormone-sensitive disease. Previous therapy included letrozole or anastrozole (100%), tamoxifen (48%), fulvestrant (16%), and chemotherapy (68%). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were stomatitis (8% in the everolimus-plus-exemestane group vs. 1% in the placebo-plus-exemestane group), anemia (6% vs. <1%), dyspnea (4% vs. 1%), hyperglycemia (4% vs. <1%), fatigue (4% vs. 1%), and pneumonitis (3% vs. 0%). At the interim analysis, median progression-free survival was 6.9 months with everolimus plus exemestane and 2.8 months with placebo plus exemestane, according to assessments by local investigators (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.54; P<0.001). Median progression-free survival was 10.6 months and 4.1 months, respectively, according to central assessment (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.47; P<0.001).

        "abstract": "Background: Standardized indications for treatment of tumor-related spinal instability are hampered by the lack of a valid and reliable classification system. The objective of this study was to determine the interobserver reliability, intraobserver reliability, and predictive validity of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS). Methods: Clinical and radiographic data from 30 patients with spinal tumors were classified as stable, potentially unstable, and unstable by members of the Spine Oncology Study Group. The median category for each patient case (consensus opinion) was used as the gold standard for predictive validity testing. On two occasions at least 6 weeks apart, each rater also scored each patient using SINS. Each total score was converted into a three-category data field, with 0 to 6 as stable, 7 to 12 as potentially unstable, and 13 to 18 as unstable. Results: The κ statistics for interobserver reliability were 0.790, 0.841, 0.244, 0.456, 0.462, and 0.492 for the fields of location, pain, bone quality, alignment, vertebral body collapse, and posterolateral involvement, respectively. The κ statistics for intraobserver reliability were 0.806, 0.859, 0.528, 0.614, 0.590, and 0.662 for the same respective fields. Intraclass correlation coefficients for inter- and intraobserver reliability of total SINS score were 0.846 (95% CI, 0.773 to 0.911) and 0.886 (95% CI, 0.868 to 0.902), respectively. The κ statistic for predictive validity was 0.712 (95% CI, 0.676 to 0.766). Conclusion: SINS demonstrated near-perfect inter- and intraobserver reliability in determining three clinically relevant categories of stability. The sensitivity and specificity of SINS for potentially unstable or unstable lesions were 95.7% and 79.5%, respectively.",

Methods: We searched literature databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared different chemotherapy durations in the first-line treatment of MBC. Only trials with unconfounded comparisons of additional cycles of chemotherapy were included. The main outcome measures for this analysis were OS and PFS. Published data from retrieved studies were analyzed according to standard meta-analytic techniques. Results: We found 11 randomized clinical trials including 2,269 patients. Longer first-line chemotherapy duration resulted into a significantly improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99; P = .046) and PFS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.76; P < .001). There were no differences in effects on either OS or PFS between subgroups defined by time of random assignment, study design, number of chemotherapy cycles in the control arm or concomitant endocrine therapy.

Methods: Postmenopausal women with HER2/hormone receptor-copositive MBC were randomly assigned to anastrozole (1 mg/d orally) with or without trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous infusion on day 1, then 2 mg/kg every week) until progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat population. Results Overall, 103 patients received trastuzumab plus anastrozole; 104 received anastrozole alone. Patients in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole arm experienced significant improvements in PFS compared with patients receiving anastrozole alone (hazard ratio = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84; median PFS, 4.8 v 2.4 months; log-rank P = .0016). In patients with centrally confirmed hormone receptor positivity (n = 150), median PFS was 5.6 and 3.8 months in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole and anastrozole alone arms, respectively (log-rank P = .006). Overall survival in the overall and centrally confirmed hormone receptor-positive populations showed no statistically significant treatment difference; however, 70% of patients in the anastrozole alone arm crossed over to receive trastuzumab after progression on anastrozole alone. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was 23% and 5%, respectively, in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole arm, and 15% and 1%, respectively, in the anastrozole alone arm; one patient in the combination arm experienced New York Heart Association class II congestive heart failure.

        "abstract": "Background: Cross-talk between human epidermal growth factor receptors and hormone receptor pathways may cause endocrine resistance in breast cancer. This trial evaluated the effect of adding lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole as first-line treatment of hormone receptor (HR) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC were randomly assigned to daily letrozole (2.5 mg orally) plus lapatinib (1,500 mg orally) or letrozole and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the HER2-positive population. Results In HR-positive, HER2-positive patients (n = 219), addition of lapatinib to letrozole significantly reduced the risk of disease progression versus letrozole-placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .019); median PFS was 8.2 v 3.0 months, respectively. Clinical benefit (responsive or stable disease >or= 6 months) was significantly greater for lapatinib-letrozole versus letrozole-placebo (48% v 29%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8; P = .003). Patients with centrally confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors (n = 952) had no improvement in PFS. A preplanned Cox regression analysis identified prior antiestrogen therapy as a significant factor in the HER2-negative population; a nonsignificant trend toward prolonged PFS for lapatinib-letrozole was seen in patients who experienced relapse less than 6 months since prior tamoxifen discontinuation (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P = .117). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common in the lapatinib-letrozole arm versus letrozole-placebo arm (diarrhea, 10% v 1%; rash, 1% v 0%, respectively), but they were manageable. Results: This trial demonstrated that a combined targeted strategy with letrozole and lapatinib significantly enhances PFS and clinical benefit rates in patients with MBC that coexpresses HR and HER2.",

This meta-analysis uses data from all relevant trials to detect any advantages of taxanes in terms of tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and survival. Methods: Individual patient data were collected on eight randomized combination trials comparing anthracyclines + taxanes (+ cyclophosphamide in one trial) with anthracyclines + cyclophosphamide (+ fluorouracil in four trials), and on three single-agent trials comparing taxanes with anthracyclines. Combination trials included 3,034 patients; single-agent trials included 919 patients. Results: Median follow-up of living patients was 43 months, median survival was 19.3 months, and median PFS was 7.1 months. In single-agent trials, response rates were similar in the taxanes (38%) and in the anthracyclines (33%) arms (P = .08). The hazard ratios for taxanes compared with anthracyclines were 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.36; P = .011) for PFS and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P = .90) for survival.

        "abstract": "Background: It is commonly thought that combining chemotherapy agents for treating women with metastatic breast cancer will result in regimens that are more active, offer superior tumour response rates with more time before progression and improve overall survival. However, it is not known whether giving patients more intensive chemotherapy regimens (judged according to some measure eg dose, dose intensity, response rate, or toxicity) results in better health outcomes. One way to investigate the effect of more versus less-intensive chemotherapy is to compare regimens containing a single drug (and hence possibly less active treatment) with regimens containing a greater number of drugs (and hence possibly more active but more toxic), even when adjustments are made to dosages or schedules to account for toxicity. Methods: To compare use of single chemotherapy agents with regimens containing a combination of agents for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Results: The Specialised Register maintained by the Editorial Base of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on 2nd May 2003 using the codes for \"advanced breast cancer\", \"chemotherapy\". Details of the search strategy applied by the group to create the register, and the procedure used to code references, are described in the group's module on The Cochrane Library.

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the impact of prior adjuvant chemotherapy on response rate (RR), progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of metastatic breast cancer patients treated with epirubicin/paclitaxel (ET) regimens. In all, 291 patients enrolled in five studies in metastatic breast cancer were analysed: 101 (35%) were chemonaive, 109 (37%) had received adjuvant CMF and 81 (28%) adjuvant anthracyclines. Response rate to ET was 66%. Response rate was 63% for cyclophosphamide plus methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil (CMF), 67% for prior anthracyclines and 68% in chemonaive patients (P=0.5). By multivariate analysis, adjusted odds ratio for response was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.37-1.79) for CMF and 0.92 (95% CI 0.43-2.01) for anthracyclines (P=0.86). The CR rates were 14% for both CMF and anthracyclines and 22% for chemonaive patients (P=0.2). By multivariate analysis, the relative odds of CR for CMF or anthracyclines were 0.40 and 0.39 as compared to chemonaive patients (P=0.036). The median PFS was 11.0 months for prior CMF, 10.2 months for anthracyclines and 12.5 months in chemonaive patients (P=0.33). In multivariate Cox's model, a nonsignificant increase in the risk of progression was seen in patients treated with adjuvant CMF or anthracyclines. The median OS was 23.8 months for CMF, 20.2 months for anthracyclines and 27.5 months in chemonaive patients (P=0.61). The same, nonsignificant, association was seen in multivariate analysis. The ET regimens provide satisfactory results in metastatic breast cancer, regardless of previous adjuvant chemotherapy.",

There are sections on the prevention of bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and helminth infections and on hospital infection control, strategies for safe living following transplantation, immunizations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The guidelines are evidence-based, and prevention strategies are rated by both the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence that supports it. Recommendations are given for preventing cytomegalovirus disease with prophylactic or preemptive gancyclovir, herpes simplex virus disease with prophylactic acyclovir, candidiasis with fluconazole, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Hopefully, following the recommendations made in the guidelines will reduce morbidity and mortality from opportunistic infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Prospective data on the risk of recurrence among women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer who temporarily discontinue endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy are lacking. Methods: We conducted a single-group trial in which we evaluated the temporary interruption of adjuvant endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy in young women with previous breast cancer. Eligible women were 42 years of age or younger; had had stage I, II, or III disease; had received adjuvant endocrine therapy for 18 to 30 months; and desired pregnancy. The primary end point was the number of breast cancer events (defined as local, regional, or distant recurrence of invasive breast cancer or new contralateral invasive breast cancer) during follow-up. The primary analysis was planned to be performed after 1600 patient-years of follow-up. The prespecified safety threshold was the occurrence of 46 breast cancer events during this period. Breast cancer outcomes in this treatment-interruption group were compared with those in an external control cohort consisting of women who would have met the entry criteria for the current trial. Results: Among 516 women, the median age was 37 years, the median time from breast cancer diagnosis to enrollment was 29 months, and 93.4% had stage I or II disease. Among 497 women who were followed for pregnancy status, 368 (74.0%) had at least one pregnancy and 317 (63.8%) had at least one live birth. In total, 365 babies were born. At 1638 patient-years of follow-up (median follow-up, 41 months), 44 patients had a breast cancer event, a result that did not exceed the safety threshold. The 3-year incidence of breast cancer events was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 11.6) in the treatment-interruption group and 9.2% (95% CI, 7.6 to 10.8) in the control cohort. Conclusion: Among select women with previous hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy did not confer a greater short-term risk of breast cancer events, including distant recurrence, than that in the external control cohort. Further follow-up is critical to inform longer-term safety. (Funded by ETOP IBCSG Partners Foundation and others; POSITIVE ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "abstract": "Background: The achievement of pathologic complete response (pCR) is strongly prognostic for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early breast cancer (EBC), and adapting postneoadjuvant therapy improves long-term outcomes for patients with HER2-positive disease not achieving pCR. We sought to investigate prognostic factors for EFS and OS among patients with and without pCR after neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy. Methods: We used individual data from 3,710 patients randomly assigned in 11 neoadjuvant trials for HER2-positive EBC with ≥100 patients enrolled, available data for pCR, EFS, and OS, and follow-up ≥3 years. We assessed baseline clinical tumor size (cT) and clinical nodal status (cN) as prognostic factors using stratified (by trial and treatment) Cox models separately for hormone receptor-positive versus hormone receptor-negative disease, and for patients who had pCR (pCR+; ypT0/is, ypN0) versus patients who did not achieve a pCR (pCR-). Results: The median follow-up overall was 61.2 months. In pCR+ patients, cT and cN were significant independent prognostic factors for EFS, whereas only cT was a significant predictor for OS. In pCR- patients, cT, cN, and hormone receptor status were significant independent predictors for both EFS and OS. Regardless of hormone receptor status, cT, and cN, the 5-year EFS/OS rates were higher in pCR+ patients than in pCR- patients. In most subsets with regards to hormone receptor and pCR status, cT and cN were independent prognostic factors for both EFS and OS, including pCR+ patients. Conclusion: These results confirm that patients achieving pCR have far better survival outcomes than patients who do not. The traditional poor prognostic features, namely tumor size and nodal status, remain important even after a pCR.",

        "abstract": "Background: Anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer substantially improves survival compared with no chemotherapy. However, concerns about short-term and long-term side-effects of anthracyclines have led to increased use of taxane chemotherapy without anthracycline, which could compromise efficacy. We aimed to better characterise the benefits and risks of including anthracycline, and the comparative benefits of different anthracycline-taxane regimens. Methods: We did an individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing taxane regimens with versus without anthracycline, and updated our previous meta-analysis of anthracycline regimens with versus without taxane, as well as analysing 44 trials in six related comparisons. We searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts to identify trials assessing anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant trials were eligible if they began before Jan 1, 2012. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality. Log-rank analyses yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs) and CIs. Results: 28 trials of taxane regimens with or without anthracycline were identified, of which 23 were deemed eligible, and 15 provided data on 18 103 women. Across all 15 trials that provided individual data, recurrence rates were 14% lower on average (RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·79-0·93; p=0·0004) with taxane regimens including anthracycline than those without. Non-breast cancer deaths were not increased but there was one additional acute myeloid leukaemia case per 700 women treated. The clearest reductions in recurrence were found when anthracycline was added concurrently to docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide versus the same dose of docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (10-year recurrence risk 12·3% vs 21·0%; risk difference 8·7%, 95% CI 4·5-12·9; RR 0·58, 0·47-0·73; p<0·0001). 10-year breast cancer mortality in this group was reduced by 4·2% (0·4-8·1; p=0·0034). No significant reduction in recurrence risk was found for sequential schedules of taxane plus anthracycline when compared with docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (RR 0·94, 0·83-1·06; p=0·30). For the analysis of anthracycline regimens with versus without taxane, 35 trials (n=52 976) provided individual patient data. Larger recurrence reductions were seen from adding taxane to anthracycline regimens when the cumulative dose of anthracycline was the same in each group (RR 0·87, 0·82-0·93; p<0·0001; n=11 167) than in trials with two-fold higher cumulative doses of non-taxane (mostly anthracycline) in the control group than in the taxane group (RR 0·96, 0·90-1·03; p=0·27; n=14 620). Direct comparisons between anthracycline and taxane regimens showed that a higher cumulative dose and more dose-intense schedules were more efficacious. The proportional reductions in recurrence for taxane plus anthracycline were similar in oestrogen receptor-positive and oestrogen receptor-negative disease, and did not differ by age, nodal status, or tumour size or grade. Conclusion: Anthracycline plus taxane regimens are most efficacious at reducing breast cancer recurrence and death. Regimens with higher cumulative doses of anthracycline plus taxane provide the greatest benefits, challenging the current trend in clinical practice and guidelines towards non-anthracycline chemotherapy, particularly shorter regimens, such as four cycles of docetaxel-cyclophosphamide. By bringing together data from almost all relevant trials, this meta-analysis provides a reliable evidence base to inform individual treatment decisions, clinical guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials.",

Here, we present the 10-year results. Methods: We randomly assigned 500 women with breast IEN (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS], or hormone-sensitive or unknown DCIS) to low-dose tamoxifen or placebo after surgery with or without irradiation. The primary end point was the incidence of invasive breast cancer or DCIS. Results: The TAM-01 population included 500 women (20% atypical ductal hyperplasia, 11% LCIS, and 69% DCIS). The mean (±SD) age at the start of treatment was 54 ± 9 years, and 58% of participants were postmenopausal. After a median follow-up of 9.7 years (IQR, 8.3-10.9 years), 66 breast cancers (15 in situ; 51 invasive) were diagnosed: 25 in the tamoxifen group and 41 in the placebo group (annual rate per 1,000 person-years, 11.3 with tamoxifen   19.5 with placebo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.95; log-rank   = .03). Most recurrences were invasive (77%) and ipsilateral (59%). Regarding contralateral breast cancer incidence, there were six events in the tamoxifen arm and 16 in the placebo arm (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.92;   = .025). The number needed to be treated to prevent one case of breast event with tamoxifen therapy was 22 in 5 years and 14 in 10 years. The benefit was seen across all patient subgroups. There was a significant 50% reduction of recurrence with tamoxifen in the DCIS cohort, which represents 70% of the overall population (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.91;   = .02). No between-group difference in the incidence of serious adverse events was reported during the prolonged follow-up period. Conclusion: Tamoxifen 5 mg once daily for 3 years significantly prevents recurrence from noninvasive breast cancer after 7 years from treatment cessation without long-term adverse events.",

Methods: In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients aged 18 years or older, with small (≤3 cm), node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, were recruited from 16 institutions in 13 cities in the USA. Eligible patients were given intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m ) with intravenous trastuzumab (loading dose of 4 mg/kg, subsequent doses 2 mg/kg) weekly for 12 weeks, followed by trastuzumab (weekly at 2 mg/kg or once every 3 weeks at 6 mg/kg) for 40 weeks to complete a full year of trastuzumab. The primary endpoint was 3-year invasive disease-free survival. Here, we report 10-year survival outcomes, assessed in all participants who received protocol-defined treatment, with exploratory analyses using the HER2DX genomic tool. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is closed to accrual. Results: Between Oct 29, 2007, and Sept 3, 2010, 410 patients were enrolled and 406 were given adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab and included in the analysis. Mean age at enrolment was 55 years (SD 10·5), 405 (99·8%) of 406 patients were female and one (0·2%) was male, 350 (86·2%) were White, 28 (6·9%) were Black or African American, and 272 (67·0%) had hormone receptor-positive disease. After a median follow-up of 10·8 years (IQR 7·1-11·4), among 406 patients included in the analysis population, we observed 31 invasive disease-free survival events, of which six (19·4%) were locoregional ipsilateral recurrences, nine (29·0%) were new contralateral breast cancers, six (19·4%) were distant recurrences, and ten (32·3%) were all-cause deaths. 10-year invasive disease-free survival was 91·3% (95% CI 88·3-94·4), 10-year recurrence-free interval was 96·3% (95% CI 94·3-98·3), 10-year overall survival was 94·3% (95% CI 91·8-96·8), and 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 98·8% (95% CI 97·6-100). HER2DX risk score as a continuous variable was significantly associated with invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-unit increment 1·24 [95% CI 1·00-1·52]; p=0·047) and recurrence-free interval (1·45 [1·09-1·93]; p=0·011). Conclusion: Adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab is a reasonable treatment standard for patients with small, node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer. The HER2DX genomic tool might help to refine the prognosis for this population.",

Here, we report updated results from an interim analysis to assess overall survival as well as invasive disease-free survival and distant relapse-free survival with additional follow-up. Methods: In monarchE, an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who had hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive, early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were recruited from 603 sites including hospitals and academic and community centres in 38 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by means of an interactive web-based response system (block size of 4), stratified by previous chemotherapy, menopausal status, and region, to receive standard-of-care endocrine therapy of physician's choice for up to 10 years with or without abemaciclib 150 mg orally twice a day for 2 years (treatment period). All therapies were administered in an open-label manner without masking. High-risk disease was defined as either four or more positive axillary lymph nodes, or between one and three positive axillary lymph nodes and either grade 3 disease or tumour size of 5 cm or larger (cohort 1). A smaller group of patients were enrolled with between one and three positive axillary lymph nodes and Ki-67 of at least 20% as an additional risk feature (cohort 2). This was a prespecified overall survival interim analysis planned to occur 2 years after the primary outcome analysis for invasive disease-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing. Results: Between July 17, 2017, and Aug 12, 2019, 5637 patients were randomly assigned (5601 [99·4%] were women and 36 [0·6%] were men). 2808 were assigned to receive abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy and 2829 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone. At a median follow-up of 42 months (IQR 37-47), median invasive disease-free survival was not reached in either group and the invasive disease-free survival benefit previously reported was sustained: HR 0·664 (95% CI 0·578-0·762, nominal p<0·0001). At 4 years, the absolute difference in invasive disease-free survival between the groups was 6·4% (85·8% [95% CI 84·2-87·3] in the abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy group vs 79·4% [77·5-81·1] in the endocrine therapy alone group). 157 (5·6%) of 2808 patients in the abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy group died compared with 173 (6·1%) of 2829 patients in the endocrine therapy alone group (HR 0·929, 95% CI 0·748-1·153; p=0·50). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (in 548 [19·6%] of 2791 patients receiving abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy vs 24 [0·9%] of 2800 patients in the endocrine therapy alone group), leukopenia (318 [11·4%] vs 11 [0·4%]), and diarrhoea (218 [7·8%] vs six [0·2%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 433 (15·5%) of 2791 patients receiving abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy versus 256 (9·1%) of 2800 receiving endocrine therapy. There were two treatment-related deaths in the abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy group (diarrhoea and pneumonitis) and none in the endocrine therapy alone group. Conclusion: Adjuvant abemaciclib reduces the risk of recurrence. The benefit is sustained beyond the completion of treatment with an absolute increase at 4 years, further supporting the use of abemaciclib in patients with high-risk hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer. Further follow-up is needed to establish whether overall survival can be improved with abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy in these patients.",

Rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) did not differ between the two groups. Here, we present the survival outcomes from PREDIX HER2 and investigate metabolic response and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as prognostic factors. Methods: In total, 202 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled and 197 patients received six cycles of either THP or T-DM1. Secondary endpoints included event-free survival (EFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Assessment with PET/CT was performed at baseline, after two and six treatment cycles. TILs were assessed manually at baseline biopsies, while image-based evaluation of TILs [digital TILs (DTIL)] was performed in digitized full-face sections. Results: After a median follow-up of 5.21 years, there was no difference between the two treatment groups in terms of EFS [HR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-2.91], RFS (HR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.24-1.93), or OS (HR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.09-2.82). Higher SUVmax at cycle 2 (C2) predicted lower pCR (ORadj = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87; P = 0.005) and worse EFS (HRadj = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.41; P < 0.001). Baseline TILs and DTILs provided additional prognostic information to clinical parameters and C2 SUVmax. Conclusion: Long-term outcomes following neoadjuvant T-DM1 were similar to neoadjuvant THP. SUVmax after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer may be an independent predictor of both short- and long-term outcomes. Combined assessment with TILs may facilitate early selection of poor responders for alternative treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Background: The randomized, double-blind OlympiA trial compared 1 year of the oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, olaparib, to matching placebo as adjuvant therapy for patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 (gBRCA1/2pv) and high-risk, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, early breast cancer (EBC). The first pre-specified interim analysis (IA) previously demonstrated statistically significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS). The olaparib group had fewer deaths than the placebo group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance for overall survival (OS). We now report the pre-specified second IA of OS with updates of IDFS, DDFS, and safety. Methods: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to olaparib or placebo following (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy if indicated. Endocrine therapy was given concurrently with study medication for hormone receptor-positive cancers. Statistical significance for OS at this IA required P < 0.015. Results: With a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the second IA of OS demonstrated significant improvement in the olaparib group relative to the placebo group [hazard ratio 0.68; 98.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.97; P = 0.009]. Four-year OS was 89.8% in the olaparib group and 86.4% in the placebo group (Δ 3.4%, 95% CI -0.1% to 6.8%). Four-year IDFS for the olaparib group versus placebo group was 82.7% versus 75.4% (Δ 7.3%, 95% CI 3.0% to 11.5%) and 4-year DDFS was 86.5% versus 79.1% (Δ 7.4%, 95% CI 3.6% to 11.3%), respectively. Subset analyses for OS, IDFS, and DDFS demonstrated benefit across major subgroups. No new safety signals were identified including no new cases of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Conclusion: With 3.5 years of median follow-up, OlympiA demonstrates statistically significant improvement in OS with adjuvant olaparib compared with placebo for gBRCA1/2pv-associated EBC and maintained improvements in the previously reported, statistically significant endpoints of IDFS and DDFS with no new safety signals.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast reconstruction is generally discouraged in women with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Nevertheless, reconstruction rates are increasing in this population. Methods: We aimed to determine contemporary trends and predictors of breast reconstruction use and its impact on mortality among IBC patients. Results: Demographic, clinicopathologic, and follow-up data for women with non-metastatic IBC having mastectomy between 2004 and 2015 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries database. Rates and predictors of immediate breast reconstruction, along with survival outcomes between the breast reconstruction and no reconstruction groups were calculated. To account for selection bias, a propensity score analysis matching one reconstruction patient to three no reconstruction patients was performed. Conclusion: A total of 4076 women with non-metastatic IBC who underwent mastectomy (388 [9.5%] with breast reconstruction and 3688 [90.5%] without) were included. The proportion of women undergoing breast reconstruction and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy increased from 6.2 to 15.3% and 12.9 to 29.6%, respectively, between 2004 and 2015. Younger age, higher annual income, metropolitan residence, and bilateral mastectomy predicted breast reconstruction use. The 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 62.9% for women having breast reconstruction and 47.6% for women not having breast reconstruction. After propensity-matched analysis, 10-year cancer-specific survival was similar between the reconstruction (56.6%) and no reconstruction (62.2%) groups (adjusted hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.79-1.16; p = 0.65).",

In the GeparNuevo ( ) trial, addition of durvalumab to NACT as previously reported led to a moderate increase in pathological complete response (pCR) rate by an absolute 9% (P = 0.287). Methods: Patients with cT1b-cT4a-d triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) received durvalumab 1.5 g or placebo every 4 weeks added to nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m  weekly for 12 weeks, followed by durvalumab/placebo every 4 weeks plus epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks followed by surgery. Durvalumab was not continued after surgery. The primary objective was pCR. Secondary endpoints included invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 174 patients were randomised between June 2016 and October 2017. After a median follow-up of 43.7 months, 34 events had occurred. Despite a non-significant increase in the pCR rate, significant differences were observed for 3-year iDFS, DDFS and OS: iDFS was 85.6% with durvalumab versus 77.2% with placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.97, stratified log-rank P = 0.036]; DDFS 91.7% versus 78.4% (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.74, P = 0.005); OS 95.2% versus 83.5% (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.72, P = 0.006). pCR patients had 3-year iDFS of 95.5% with durvalumab and 86.1% without (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-1.06). In the non-pCR cohort 3-year iDFS was 76.3% versus 69.7% (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.29-1.54). Multivariable analysis confirmed a durvalumab effect independent of the pCR effect. No new safety signals occurred. Conclusion: Durvalumab added to NACT in TNBC significantly improved survival despite a modest pCR increase and no adjuvant component of durvalumab. Additional studies are needed to clarify the optimal duration and sequence of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of early TNBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: Primary chemotherapy in breast cancer poses a dilemma with regard to adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy, as guidelines for locoregional radiotherapy were originally based on pathology results of primary surgery. We aimed to evaluate the oncological safety of de-escalated locoregional radiotherapy in patients with cT1-2N1 breast cancer treated with primary chemotherapy, according to a predefined, consensus-based study guideline. Methods: In this prospective registry study (RAPCHEM, BOOG 2010-03), patients referred to one of 17 participating radiation oncology centres in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2011, and Jan 1, 2015, with cT1-2N1 breast cancer (one to three suspicious nodes on imaging before primary chemotherapy, of which at least one had been pathologically confirmed), and who were treated with primary chemotherapy and surgery of the breast and axilla were included in the study. The study guideline comprised three risk groups for locoregional recurrence, with corresponding locoregional radiotherapy recommendations: no chest wall radiotherapy and no regional radiotherapy in the low-risk group, only local radiotherapy in the intermediate-risk group, and locoregional radiotherapy in the high-risk group. Radiotherapy consisted of a biologically equivalent dose of 25 fractions of 2 Gy, with or without a boost. During the study period, the generally applied radiotherapy technique in the Netherlands was forward-planned or inverse-planned intensity modulated radiotherapy. 5-year follow-up was assessed, taking into account adherence to the study guideline, with locoregional recurrence rate as primary endpoint. We hypothesised that 5-year locoregional recurrence rate would be less than 4% (upper-limit 95% CI 7·8%). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is completed. Results: 838 patients were eligible for 5-year follow-up analyses: 291 in the low-risk group, 370 in the intermediate-risk group, and 177 in the high-risk group. The 5-year locoregional recurrence rate in all patients was 2·2% (95% CI 1·4-3·4). The 5-year locoregional recurrence rate was 2·1% (0·9-4·3) in the low-risk group, 2·2% (1·0-4·1) in the intermediate-risk group, and 2·3% (0·8-5·5) in the high-risk group. If the study guideline was followed, the locoregional recurrence rate was 2·3% (0·8-5·3) for the low-risk group, 1·0% (0·2-3·4) for the intermediate-risk group, and 1·4% (0·3-4·5) for the high-risk group. Conclusion: In this study, the 5-year locoregional recurrence rate was less than 4%, which supports our hypothesis that it is oncologically safe to de-escalate locoregional radiotherapy based on locoregional recurrence risk, in selected patients with cT1-2N1 breast cancer treated with primary chemotherapy, according to this predefined, consensus-based study guideline.",

        "abstract": "Background: Whole breast irradiation (WBI) after conservative surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) reduces local recurrence. We investigated whether a tumour bed boost after WBI improved outcomes, and examined radiation dose fractionation sensitivity for non-low-risk DCIS. Methods: The study was an international, randomised, unmasked, phase 3 trial involving 136 participating centres of six clinical trials organisations in 11 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, Ireland, and the UK). Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older with unilateral, histologically proven, non-low-risk DCIS treated by breast-conserving surgery with at least 1 mm of clear radial resection margins. They were assigned to one of four groups (1:1:1:1) of no tumour bed boost versus boost after conventional versus hypofractionated WBI, or randomly assigned to one of two groups (1:1) of no boost versus boost after each centre prespecified conventional or hypofractionated WBI. The conventional WBI used was 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and hypofractionated WBI was 42·5 Gy in 16 fractions. A boost dose of 16 Gy in eight fractions, if allocated, was delivered after WBI. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time to local recurrence. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ). Results: Between June 25, 2007, and June 30, 2014, 1608 patients were randomly assigned to have no boost (805 patients) or boost (803 patients). Conventional WBI was given to 831 patients, and hypofractionated WBI was given to 777 patients. Median follow-up was 6·6 years. The 5-year free-from-local-recurrence rates were 92·7% (95% CI 90·6-94·4%) in the no-boost group and 97·1% (95·6-98·1%) in the boost group (hazard ratio 0·47; 0·31-0·72; p<0·001). The boost group had higher rates of grade 2 or higher breast pain (10% [8-12%] vs 14% [12-17%], p=0·003) and induration (6% [5-8%] vs 14% [11-16%], p<0·001). Conclusion: In patients with resected non-low-risk DCIS, a tumour bed boost after WBI reduced local recurrence with an increase in grade 2 or greater toxicity. The results provide the first randomised trial data to support the use of boost radiation after postoperative WBI in these patients to improve local control. The international scale of the study supports the generalisability of the results.",

        "abstract": "Background: Several de-escalation neoadjuvant strategies have been investigated to reduce the use of chemotherapy in HER2-positive early breast cancer using pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint; there are few survival data from these trials. Here, we report 5-year survival data in the WSG-ADAPT-HER2+/HR- trial and address the effect of pathological complete response, early therapy response, and molecular subtype. Methods: WSG-ASAPT-HER2+/HR-, a part of the ADAPT umbrella trial performed in patients with different subtypes of early breast cancer, was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial done at 40 Breast Cancer Centres in Germany. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, unilateral, primary invasive, non-inflammatory early breast cancer, hormone receptor-negative and HER2-positive status, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 or a Karnofsky performance status of at least 80%. Patients were randomly assigned (5:2, block size 21, stratified by centre and clinical nodal status) to 12 weeks of either trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks) or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m  weekly); all drugs were administered intravenously. The primary objective of the trial was to compare the number of patients with a pathological complete response at surgery (ie, no invasive tumour cells in breast and lymph nodes [ypT0/is ypN0], the primary endpoint) in early responders (ie, low cellularity or Ki67 decrease ≥30% after 3 weeks) in the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab group versus all patients (irrespective of an early response) in the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel group. Non-inferiority was defined as a pathological complete response no worse than 23% lower in the early-responder proportion of patients in the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab group than in the entire trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel group. The primary endpoint has been reported previously. Additionally, the primary objective of the ADAPT umbrella trial was the evaluation of the effect of pathological complete response on invasive disease-free survival. At investigator's discretion, further chemotherapy could be omitted in patients with a pathological complete response. Secondary survival endpoints were 5-year invasive disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, distant disease-free survival, and overall survival. The effect of pathological complete response on survival was estimated by Cox regression analysis. All analyses are reported in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and is closed to recruitment. Results: Between March 3, 2014, and Oct 6, 2015, 134 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to treatment, 92 to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and 42 to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel. Median follow-up in survivors was 59·9 months (IQR 53·4-61·4). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in invasive disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, distant disease-free survival, and overall survival. In the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel group and in the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab group, the proportions of patients achieving 5-year survival respectively were 98% (95% CI 84-100) and 87% (78-93) for invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·32, 95% CI 0·07-1·49; p=0·15); 98% (95% CI 84-100) and 89% (79-94) for relapse-free survival (HR 0·41, 95% CI 0·09-1·91; p=0·25); 100% (95% CI not estimable) and 95% (88-98) for locoregional relapse-free survival (HR 0·41, 95% CI 0·05-3·75; p=0·43); 98% (95% CI 84-100) and 92% (83-96) for distant disease-free survival (HR 0·35, 95% CI 0·04-3·12; p=0·36), and 98% (95% CI 84-100) and 94% (86-97) for overall survival (HR 0·41, 95% CI 0·05-3·63; p=0·43). Pathological complete response was associated with improved invasive disease-free survival (HR 0·14, 95% CI 0·03-0·64; p=0·011). Two invasive disease-free survival events occurred after a pathological complete response (one in each treatment group). Conclusion: The WSG-ADAPT-HER2+/HR- trial showed good survival rates in patients with a pathological complete response after de-escalated 12-week trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with or without weekly paclitaxel. Omission of further chemotherapy did not affect invasive disease-free survival in patients with a pathological complete response. 12 weeks of weekly paclitaxel plus dual HER2 blockade could be an efficacious de-escalated neoadjuvant regimen in patients with hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive early breast cancer with high pathological complete response rates and good 5-year outcomes. Further trials of this approach are ongoing.",

        "abstract": "Background: To our knowledge, WSG-ADAPT-HR+/HER2- (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ; n = 5,625 registered) is the first trial combining the 21-gene expression assay (recurrence score [RS]) and response to 3-week preoperative endocrine therapy (ET) to guide systemic therapy in early breast cancer. Methods: Baseline and postendocrine Ki67 (Ki67 ) were evaluated centrally. In the endocrine trial, all patients received exclusively ET: patients with pathologic regional lymph node status (pN) 0-1 (ie, 0-3 involved lymph nodes) entered control arm if RS ≤ 11 and experimental arm if RS12-25 with ET response (Ki67  ≤ 10%). All other patients (including N0-1 RS12-25   ET response) received dose-dense chemotherapy (CT) followed by ET in the CT trial. Primary end point of the endocrine trial was noninferiority of 5-year invasive disease-free survival (5y-iDFS) in experimental (  control) arm; secondary end points included distant DFS, overall survival, and translational research. Results: Intention-to-treat population comprised 2,290 patients (n = 1,422 experimental   n = 868 control): 26.3% versus 34.6% premenopausal and 27.4% versus 24.0% pN1. One-sided 95% lower confidence limit of the 5y-iDFS difference was -3.3%, establishing prespecified noninferiority (  = .05). 5y-iDFS was 92.6% (95% CI, 90.8 to 94.0) in experimental versus 93.9% (95% CI, 91.8 to 95.4) in control arm; 5-year distant DFS was 95.6% versus 96.3%, and 5-year overall survival 97.3% versus 98.0%, respectively. Differences were similar in age and nodal subgroups. In N0-1 RS12-25, outcome of ET responders (ET alone) was comparable with that of ET nonresponders (CT) for age > 50 years and superior for age ≤ 50 years. ET response was more likely with aromatase inhibitors (mostly postmenopausal) than with tamoxifen (mostly premenopausal): 78.1% versus 41.1% (  < .001). ET response was 78.8% in RS0-11, 62.2% in RS12-25, and 32.7% in RS > 25 (n = 4,203,   < .001). Conclusion: WSG-ADAPT-HR+/HER2- demonstrates that guiding systemic treatment by both RS and ET response is feasible in clinical routine and spares CT in pre- and postmenopausal patients with ≤ 3 involved lymph nodes.",

        "abstract": "Background: Despite the large number of patients with early breast cancer (EBC) who have been treated with capecitabine in randomised trials, no individual patient data meta-analysis has been conducted. The primary objective was to examine the effect of capecitabine on disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary objectives were to analyse distant DFS (DDFS), overall survival (OS), pathological complete response (for neoadjuvant studies) and the interaction between capecitabine-related toxicity and treatment effect. Methods: www. Results: gov and www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov were searched using the following criteria: use of capecitabine for EBC as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy; multicentre randomised trial with >100 patients; recruitment completed, and outcomes available. Required data were available for 13 trials. Conclusion: Individual data from 15,993 patients were collected. Cox regression analyses of all included patients revealed that the addition of capecitabine did not alter DFS significantly compared with treatment without capecitabine (hazard ratio [HR] 0.952; 95% CI 0.895-1.012; P value = 0.115). There was also no effect on DFS in the subset of studies where capecitabine was given instead of another drug (HR 1.035; 95% CI 0.945-1.134; P = 0.455). However, capecitabine administered in addition to the standard systemic treatment improved DFS (HR 0.888; 95% CI 0.817-0.965; P = 0.005). An OS improvement was observed in the entire cohort (HR 0.892; 95% CI 0.824-0.965, P = 0.005) and in the subset of capecitabine addition (HR 0.837; 95% CI 0.751, 0.933, P = 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients benefitted from treatment with capecitabine overall and in addition to other systemic treatments in terms of DFS and OS.",

        "abstract": "Background: The addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to a significantly higher percentage of patients with early triple-negative breast cancer having a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes) at definitive surgery in an earlier analysis of this phase 3 trial of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. The primary results regarding event-free survival in this trial have not been reported. Methods: We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, patients with previously untreated stage II or III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo plus doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo (placebo-chemotherapy group) every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were pathological complete response (the results for which have been reported previously) and event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, occurrence of a second primary cancer, or death from any cause. Safety was also assessed. Results: Of the 1174 patients who underwent randomization, 784 were assigned to the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 390 to the placebo-chemotherapy group. The median follow-up at this fourth planned interim analysis (data cutoff, March 23, 2021) was 39.1 months. The estimated event-free survival at 36 months was 84.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.7 to 86.9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group, as compared with 76.8% (95% CI, 72.2 to 80.7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.82; P<0.001). Adverse events occurred predominantly during the neoadjuvant phase and were consistent with the established safety profiles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. Conclusion: In patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab after surgery, resulted in significantly longer event-free survival than neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.

        "abstract": "Background: For women with early-stage oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, adjuvant tamoxifen reduces 15-year breast cancer mortality by a third. Aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women but are ineffective in premenopausal women when used without ovarian suppression. We aimed to investigate whether premenopausal women treated with ovarian suppression benefit from aromatase inhibitors. Methods: We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials comparing aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, exemestane, or letrozole) versus tamoxifen for 3 or 5 years in premenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer receiving ovarian suppression (goserelin or triptorelin) or ablation. We collected data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of any breast cancer recurrence or second primary cancer, and dates and causes of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence (distant, locoregional, or contralateral), breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. As distant recurrence invariably results in death from breast cancer several years after the occurrence, whereas locoregional recurrence and new contralateral breast cancer are not usually fatal, the distant recurrence analysis is shown separately. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses estimated first-event rate ratios (RR) and their confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We obtained data from all four identified trials (ABCSG XII, SOFT, TEXT, and HOBOE trials), which included 7030 women with ER-positive tumours enrolled between June 17, 1999, and Aug 4, 2015. Median follow-up was 8·0 years (IQR 6·1-9·3). The rate of breast cancer recurrence was lower for women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor than for women assigned to tamoxifen (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·69-0·90, p=0·0005). The main benefit was seen in years 0-4 (RR 0·68, 99% CI 0·55-0·85; p<0·0001), the period when treatments differed, with a 3·2% (95% CI 1·8-4·5) absolute reduction in 5-year recurrence risk (6·9% vs 10·1%). There was no further benefit, or loss of benefit, in years 5-9 (RR 0·98, 99% CI 0·73-1·33, p=0·89) or beyond year 10. Distant recurrence was reduced with aromatase inhibitor (RR 0·83, 95% CI 0·71-0·97; p=0·018). No significant differences were observed between treatments for breast cancer mortality (RR 1·01, 95% CI 0·82-1·24; p=0·94), death without recurrence (1·30, 0·75-2·25; p=0·34), or all-cause mortality (1·04, 0·86-1·27; p=0·68). There were more bone fractures with aromatase inhibitor than with tamoxifen (227 [6·4%] of 3528 women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor vs 180 [5·1%] of 3502 women allocated to tamoxifen; RR 1·27 [95% CI 1·04-1·54]; p=0·017). Non-breast cancer deaths (30 [0·9%] vs 24 [0·7%]; 1·30 [0·75-2·25]; p=0·36) and endometrial cancer (seven [0·2%] vs 15 [0·3%]; 0·52 [0·22-1·23]; p=0·14) were rare. Conclusion: Using an aromatase inhibitor rather than tamoxifen in premenopausal women receiving ovarian suppression reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Longer follow-up is needed to assess any impact on breast cancer mortality.",

        "abstract": "Background: Primary analyses of the phase III BrighTNess trial showed addition of carboplatin with/without veliparib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates with manageable acute toxicity in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we report 4.5-year follow-up data from the trial. Methods: Women with untreated stage II-III TNBC were randomized (2 : 1 : 1) to paclitaxel (weekly for 12 doses) plus: (i) carboplatin (every 3 weeks for four cycles) plus veliparib (twice daily); (ii) carboplatin plus veliparib placebo; or (iii) carboplatin placebo plus veliparib placebo. All patients then received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2-3 weeks for four cycles. The primary endpoint was pCR. Secondary endpoints included event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Since the co-primary endpoint of increased pCR with carboplatin plus veliparib with paclitaxel versus carboplatin with paclitaxel was not met, secondary analyses are descriptive. Results: Of 634 patients, 316 were randomized to carboplatin plus veliparib with paclitaxel, 160 to carboplatin with paclitaxel, and 158 to paclitaxel. With median follow-up of 4.5 years, the hazard ratio for EFS for carboplatin plus veliparib with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel was 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.92, P = 0.02], but 1.12 (95% CI 0.72-1.72, P = 0.62) for carboplatin plus veliparib with paclitaxel versus carboplatin with paclitaxel. In post hoc analysis, the hazard ratio for EFS was 0.57 (95% CI 0.36-0.91, P = 0.02) for carboplatin with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel. OS did not differ significantly between treatment arms, nor did rates of myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, or other secondary malignancies. Conclusion: Improvement in pCR with the addition of carboplatin was associated with long-term EFS benefit with a manageable safety profile, and without increasing the risk of second malignancies, whereas adding veliparib did not impact EFS. These findings support the addition of carboplatin to weekly paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage TNBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: High-quality randomised clinical trials testing moderately fractionated breast radiotherapy have clearly shown that local control and survival is at least as effective as with 2 Gy daily fractions with similar or reduced normal tissue toxicity. Fewer treatment visits are welcomed by patients and their families, and reduced fractions produce substantial savings for health-care systems. Implementation of hypofractionation, however, has moved at a slow pace. The oncology community have now reached an inflection point created by new evidence from the FAST-Forward five-fraction randomised trial and catalysed by the need for the global radiation oncology community to unite during the COVID-19 pandemic and rapidly rethink hypofractionation implementation. The aim of this paper is to support equity of access for all patients to receive evidence-based breast external beam radiotherapy and to facilitate the translation of new evidence into routine daily practice. The results from this European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology Advisory Committee in Radiation Oncology Practice consensus state that moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy can be offered to any patient for whole breast, chest wall (with or without reconstruction), and nodal volumes. Ultrafractionation (five fractions) can also be offered for non-nodal breast or chest wall (without reconstruction) radiotherapy either as standard of care or within a randomised trial or prospective cohort. The consensus is timely; not only is it a pragmatic framework for radiation oncologists, but it provides a measured proposal for the path forward to influence policy makers and empower patients to ensure equity of access to evidence-based radiotherapy.",

In women with positive lymph-node disease, the role of the recurrence score with respect to predicting a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear. Methods: In a prospective trial, we randomly assigned women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, and a recurrence score of 25 or lower (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis) to endocrine therapy only or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy. The primary objective was to determine the effect of chemotherapy on invasive disease-free survival and whether the effect was influenced by the recurrence score. Secondary end points included distant relapse-free survival. Results: A total of 5083 women (33.2% premenopausal and 66.8% postmenopausal) underwent randomization, and 5018 participated in the trial. At the prespecified third interim analysis, the chemotherapy benefit with respect to increasing invasive disease-free survival differed according to menopausal status (P = 0.008 for the comparison of chemotherapy benefit in premenopausal and postmenopausal participants), and separate prespecified analyses were conducted. Among postmenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.9% in the endocrine-only group and 91.3% in the chemoendocrine group, with no chemotherapy benefit (hazard ratio for invasive disease recurrence, new primary cancer [breast cancer or another type], or death, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.26; P = 0.89). Among premenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 89.0% with endocrine-only therapy and 93.9% with chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.83; P = 0.002), with a similar increase in distant relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87; P = 0.009). The relative chemotherapy benefit did not increase as the recurrence score increased. Conclusion: Among premenopausal women with one to three positive lymph nodes and a recurrence score of 25 or lower, those who received chemoendocrine therapy had longer invasive disease-free survival and distant relapse-free survival than those who received endocrine-only therapy, whereas postmenopausal women with similar characteristics did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

However, only a few studies have compared the breast cancer outcomes between the implant-based reconstruction (IBR) and autologous flap reconstruction (AFR). In this study, we retrospectively compared the local recurrence rates, distant metastasis rates, and survival outcomes between immediate IBR and AFR. Methods: A total of 1530 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent IBR or AFR with nipple-/skin-sparing mastectomy were included. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant systemic therapy were excluded from the study. After propensity score matching by age at diagnosis, T stage, N stage, molecular subtype, mastectomy type, adjuvant radiotherapy status, and follow-up period, 938 patients were 1:1 matched, comprising the well-balanced IBR and AFR groups. Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were compared between the matched groups. Results: After matching, the median follow-up periods were 68 months and 71 months for the IBR and AFR groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the IBR and AFR groups regarding the local recurrence (7.2% vs. 5.1%; P = 0.175), regional recurrence (2.1% vs. 1.5%; P = 0.463), or distant metastasis (3.2% vs. 3.2%; P = 1.000) rates. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the IBR and AFR groups in the LRRFS (hazard ratio, 0.691; 95% CI, 0.433-1.102; P = 0.118), DFS (hazard ratio, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.468-1.076; P = 0.104), DMFS (hazard ratio, 1.006; 95% CI, 0.491-2.059; P = 0.987), or BCSS (hazard ratio, 0.445; 95% CI, 0.111-1.786; P = 0.659).

        "abstract": "Background: The benefit of extending aromatase inhibitor therapy beyond 5 years in the context of previous aromatase inhibitors remains controversial. We aimed to compare extended therapy with letrozole for 5 years versus the standard duration of 2-3 years of letrozole in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have already received 2-3 years of tamoxifen. Methods: This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial was done at 69 hospitals in Italy. Women were eligible if they were postmenopausal at the time of study entry, had stage I-III histologically proven and operable invasive hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, had received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for at least 2 years but no longer than 3 years and 3 months, had no signs of disease recurrence, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or lower. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2-3 years (control group) or 5 years (extended group) of letrozole (2·5 mg orally once a day). Randomisation, with stratification by centre, with permuted blocks of size 12, was done with a centralised, interactive, internet-based system that randomly generated the treatment allocation. Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analysis was done for patients who received at least 1 month of study treatment. This trial was registered with EudraCT, 2005-001212-44, and ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between Aug 1, 2005, and Oct 24, 2010, 2056 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive letrozole for 2-3 years (n=1030; control group) or for 5 years (n=1026; extended group). After a median follow-up of 11·7 years (IQR 9·5-13·1), disease-free survival events occurred in 262 (25·4%) of 1030 patients in the control group and 212 (20·7%) of 1026 in the extended group. 12-year disease-free survival was 62% (95% CI 57-66) in the control group and 67% (62-71) in the extended group (hazard ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·65-0·93; p=0·0064). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were arthralgia (22 [2·2%] of 983 patients in the control group vs 29 [3·0%] of 977 in the extended group) and myalgia (seven [0·7%] vs nine [0·9%]). There were three (0·3%) serious treatment-related adverse events in the control group and eight (0·8%) in the extended group. No deaths related to toxic effects were observed. Conclusion: In postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who received 2-3 years of tamoxifen, extended treatment with 5 years of letrozole resulted in a significant improvement in disease-free survival compared with the standard 2-3 years of letrozole. Sequential endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by letrozole for 5 years should be considered as one of the optimal standard endocrine treatments for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: For postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, the most effective duration for adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor remains unclear. Methods: In this prospective, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who had received 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy to receive the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole for an additional 2 years (2-year group, receiving a total of 7 years) or an additional 5 years (5-year group, receiving a total of 10 years). The primary end point was disease-free survival. The primary analysis included all the patients who were still participating in the trial and who had no recurrence 2 years after randomization (i.e., when treatment in the 2-year group had ended). Secondary end points were overall survival, contralateral breast cancer, second primary cancer, and clinical bone fracture. Results: Among the 3484 women who were enrolled in the trial, 3208 remained in the trial without disease progression after the first 2 years of extended anastrozole treatment following randomization. Among these women, disease progression or death occurred in 335 women in each treatment group in the primary-analysis set at 8 years (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.15; P = 0.90). No between-group differences occurred in most secondary end points, and subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in any particular subgroup. The risk of clinical bone fracture was higher in the 5-year group than in the 2-year group (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.84). Conclusion: In postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who had received 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, extending hormone therapy by 5 years provided no benefit over a 2-year extension but was associated with a greater risk of bone fracture.

        "abstract": "Background: Young women with breast cancer experience unique treatment and survivorship issues centering on treatment-related amenorrhea (TRA), including fertility preservation and management of ovarian function as endocrine therapy. The Young Women's Breast Cancer Study (YWS) is a multi-center, prospective cohort study of women diagnosed at age ≤40, enrolled from 2006 to 2016. Menstrual outcomes were self-reported on serial surveys. We evaluated factors associated with TRA using logistic regression. One year post-diagnosis, 286/789 (36.2%) experienced TRA, yet most resumed menses (2-year TRA: 120/699; 17.2%). Features associated with 1-year TRA included older age (OR = 0.29 (0.17-0.48), OR = 0.67 (0.46-0.94), p = 0.02); normal body mass index (BMI) (OR  =0.59 (0.41-0.83), p < 0.01); chemotherapy (OR  = 5.55 (3 60-8.82), p < 0.01); and tamoxifen (OR = 1.55 (1.11-2.16), p = 0.01). TRA rates were similar across most standard regimens (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab +/- pertuzumab: 55.6%; docetaxel/cyclophosphamide +/- trastuzumab/pertuzumab: 41.8%; doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel +/- trastuzumab/pertuzumab: 44.1%; but numerically lower with AC alone (25%) or paclitaxel/trastuzumab (11.1%). Among young women with breast cancer, lower BMI appears to be an independent predictor of TRA. This finding has important implications for interpretation of prior studies, future research, and patient care in our increasingly obese population. Additionally, these data describe TRA associated with use of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide, which is increasingly being used in lieu of anthracycline-containing regimens. Collectively, these data can be used to inform use of fertility preservation strategies for women who need to undergo treatment as well as the potential need for ovarian suppression following modern chemotherapy for young women with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.Clinical trial registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov,  .",

        "abstract": "Background: Many patients and physicians remain concerned about the potential detrimental effects of pregnancy after breast cancer (BC) in terms of reproductive outcomes and maternal safety. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at providing updated evidence on these topics. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies including patients with a pregnancy after BC (PROSPERO number CRD42020158324). Likelihood of pregnancy after BC, their reproductive outcomes, and maternal safety were assessed. Pooled relative risks, odds ratios (ORs), and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using random effects models. Results: Of 6,462 identified records, 39 were included involving 8,093,401 women from the general population and 112,840 patients with BC of whom 7,505 had a pregnancy after diagnosis. BC survivors were significantly less likely to have a subsequent pregnancy compared with the general population (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.49). Risks of caesarean section (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.25), low birth weight (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.73), preterm birth (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.88), and small for gestational age (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.33) were significantly higher in BC survivors, particularly in those with previous chemotherapy exposure, compared with the general population. No significantly increased risk of congenital abnormalities or other reproductive complications were observed. Compared to patients with BC without subsequent pregnancy, those with a pregnancy had better disease-free survival (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89) and overall survival (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68). Similar results were observed after correcting for potential confounders and irrespective of patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, pregnancy outcome, and timing of pregnancy. Conclusion: These results provide reassuring evidence on the safety of conceiving in BC survivors. Patients' pregnancy desire should be considered a crucial component of their survivorship care plan.",

Here, we present additional exploratory safety and efficacy analyses. Methods: KATHERINE enrolled HER2-positive EBC patients with residual invasive disease in the breast/axilla at surgery after NACT containing a taxane (± anthracycline, ± platinum) and trastuzumab (± pertuzumab). Patients were randomized to adjuvant T-DM1 (n = 743) or trastuzumab (n = 743) for 14 cycles. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). Results: The incidence of peripheral neuropathy (PN) was similar regardless of neoadjuvant taxane type. Irrespective of treatment arm, baseline PN was associated with longer PN duration (median, 105-109 days longer) and lower resolution rate (∼65% versus ∼82%). Prior platinum therapy was associated with more grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in the T-DM1 arm (13.5% versus 3.8%), but there was no grade ≥3 hemorrhage in these patients. Risk of recurrence or death was decreased with T-DM1 versus trastuzumab in patients who received anthracycline-based NACT [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.67], non-anthracycline-based NACT (HR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.82), presented with cT1, cN0 tumors (0 versus 6 IDFS events), or had particularly high-risk tumors (HRs ranged from 0.43 to 0.72). The central nervous system (CNS) was more often the site of first recurrence in the T-DM1 arm (5.9% versus 4.3%), but T-DM1 was not associated with a difference in overall risk of CNS recurrence. Conclusion: T-DM1 provides clinical benefit across patient subgroups, including small tumors and particularly high-risk tumors and does not increase the overall risk of CNS recurrence. NACT type had a minimal impact on safety.",

        "abstract": "Background: Shared Decision-Making (SDM) enhances patients' satisfaction with a decision, which in turn increases compliance with and adherence to cancer treatment. SDM requires a good patient-clinician relationship and communication, patients need information matching their individual needs, and clinicians need support on how to best involve the individual patient in the decision-making process. This survey assessed oncological patients' information needs and satisfaction, their preferred information in patient decision aids (PDAs), and their preferred way of making decisions regarding their treatment. Methods: Questionnaires were distributed among attendees of a lecture program on complementary and alternative medicine in oncology of which 220 oncological patients participated. Results: Participants reported a generally high need for information-correlating with level of education-but also felt overwhelmed by the amount. The latter proved particularly important during consultation. Use of PDAs increased satisfaction with given information but occurred in less than a third of the cases. Most requested contents for PDAs were pros and cons of treatment options and lists of questions to ask. The vast majority of patients preferred SDM to deciding alone. None wanted their physician to decide for them. Conclusion: There is a high demand for SDM but a lack of conclusive evidence on the specific information needs of different types of patients. Conversation between patients and clinicians needs encouragement and support. PDAs are designed for this purpose and have the potential to increase patient satisfaction. Their scarce use in consultations calls for easier access to and better information on PDAs for clinicians.",

        "abstract": "Background: This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.",

        "abstract": "Background: To develop guideline recommendations concerning optimal neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Methods: ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of the literature on neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer and provide recommended care options. Results: A total of 41 articles met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations. Conclusion: Patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy should be managed by a multidisciplinary care team. Appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy include patients with inflammatory breast cancer and those in whom residual disease may prompt a change in therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy can also be used to reduce the extent of local therapy or reduce delays in initiating therapy. Although tumor histology, grade, stage, and estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression should routinely be used to guide clinical decisions, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of other markers or genomic profiles. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have clinically node-positive and/or at least T1c disease should be offered an anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen; those with cT1a or cT1bN0 TNBC should not routinely be offered neoadjuvant therapy. Carboplatin may be offered to patients with TNBC to increase pathologic complete response. There is currently insufficient evidence to support adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to standard chemotherapy. In patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR-positive), HER2-negative tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used when a treatment decision can be made without surgical information. Among postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, hormone therapy can be used to downstage disease. Patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease should be offered neoadjuvant therapy in combination with anti-HER2-positive therapy. Patients with T1aN0 and T1bN0, HER2-positive disease should not be routinely offered neoadjuvant therapy.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.",

A consensus was reached in 42% of statements, a majority in 38%, and no decision in 21%. Based on these findings, the panel developed clinical guidance recommendations and a toolbox to overcome many clinical and technical requirements associated with the diagnosis, response assessment, surgical planning, and surgery of patients with early-stage breast cancer. This guidance could convince clinicians and patients of the major clinical advancements purported by primary systemic therapy, the use of less extensive and more targeted surgery to improve the lives of patients with breast cancer.",

Methods: ExteNET was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial of 2840 patients with HER2  eBC after neoadjuvant/adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Patients were stratified by HR status and randomly assigned 1-year oral neratinib 240 mg/day or placebo. The primary endpoint was iDFS. Descriptive analyses were performed in patients with HR  eBC who initiated treatment ≤ 1 year (HR /≤ 1-year) and > 1 year (HR /> 1-year) post-trastuzumab. Results: HR /≤ 1-year and HR /> 1-year populations comprised 1334 (neratinib, n = 670; placebo, n = 664) and 297 (neratinib, n = 146; placebo, n = 151) patients, respectively. Absolute iDFS benefits at 5 years were 5.1% in HR /≤ 1-year (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.82) and 1.3% in HR />1-year (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.29-1.84). In HR /≤ 1-year, neratinib was associated with a numerical improvement in overall survival (OS) at 8 years (absolute benefit, 2.1%; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.55-1.13). Of 354 patients in the HR /≤ 1-year group who received neoadjuvant therapy, 295 had residual disease, and results showed absolute benefits of 7.4% at 5-year iDFS (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.33-1.07) and 9.1% at 8-year OS (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.92). There were fewer central nervous system events with neratinib. Adverse events were similar to those previously reported. Conclusion: Neratinib significantly improved iDFS in the HER2 /HR /≤ 1-year population, and a similar trend was observed in patients with residual disease following neoadjuvant treatment. Numerical improvements in central nervous system events and OS were consistent with iDFS benefits and suggest long-term benefit for neratinib in this population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Preoperative and perioperative aromatase inhibitor (POAI) therapy has the potential to improve outcomes in women with operable oestrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancer. It has also been suggested that tumour Ki67 values after 2 weeks (Ki67 ) of POAI predicts individual patient outcome better than baseline Ki67 (Ki67 ). The POETIC trial aimed to test these two hypotheses. Methods: POETIC was an open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial (done in 130 UK hospitals) in which postmenopausal women aged at least 50 years with WHO performance status 0-1 and hormone receptor-positive, operable breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to POAI (letrozole 2·5 mg per day orally or anastrozole 1 mg per day orally) for 14 days before and following surgery or no POAI (control). Adjuvant treatment was given as per UK standard local practice. Randomisation was done centrally by computer-generated permuted block method (variable block size of six or nine) and was stratified by hospital. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence. A key second objective explored association between Ki67 (dichotomised at 10%) and disease outcomes. The primary analysis for clinical endpoints was by modified intention to treat (excluding patients who withdrew consent). For Ki67 biomarker association and endpoint analysis, the evaluable population included all randomly assigned patients who had paired Ki67 values available.

Recruitment is complete and long-term follow-up is ongoing. Results: Between Oct 13, 2008, and April 16, 2014, 4480 women were recruited and randomly assigned to POAI (n=2976) or control (n=1504). On Feb 6, 2018, median follow-up was 62·9 months (IQR 58·1-74·1). 434 (10%) of 4480 women had a breast cancer recurrence (280 [9%] POAI; 154 [10%] control), hazard ratio 0·92 (95% CI 0·75-1·12); p=0·40 with the proportion free from breast cancer recurrence at 5 years of 91·0% (95% CI 89·9-92·0) for patients in the POAI group and 90·4% (88·7-91·9) in the control group. Within the POAI-treated HER2-negative subpopulation, 5-year recurrence risk in women with low Ki67  and Ki67  (low-low) was 4·3% (95% CI 2·9-6·3), 8·4% (6·8-10·5) with high Ki67  and low Ki67  (high-low) and 21·5% (17·1-27·0) with high Ki67  and Ki67  (high-high). Within the POAI-treated HER2-positive subpopulation, 5-year recurrence risk in the low-low group was 10·1% (95% CI 3·2-31·3), 7·7% (3·4-17·5) in the high-low group, and 15·7% (10·1-24·4) in the high-high group. The most commonly reported grade 3 adverse events were hot flushes (20 [1%] of 2801 patients in the POAI group vs six [<1%] of 1400 in the control group) and musculoskeletal pain (29 [1%] vs 13 [1%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: POAI has not been shown to improve treatment outcome, but can be used without detriment to help select appropriate adjuvant therapy based on tumour Ki67. Most patients with low Ki67  or low POAI-induced Ki67  do well with adjuvant standard endocrine therapy (giving consideration to clinical-pathological factors), whereas those whose POAI-induced Ki67  remains high might benefit from further adjuvant treatment or trials of new therapies.",

        "abstract": "Background: An important challenge in the field of cancer is finding the balance between delivering effective treatments and avoiding adverse effects and financial toxicity caused by innovative, yet expensive, drugs. To address this, several treatment de-escalation trials have been conducted, but only a few of these have provided clear answers. A few trials had poor accrual or had design flaws that led to conflicting results. Members of the Breast International Group (BIG) and North American Breast Cancer Group (NABCG) believe the way forward is to understand the lessons from these trials and listen more carefully to what truly matters to our patients. We reviewed several adjuvant trials of different cancer types and developed a road map for improving the design and implementation of future de-escalation trials. The road map incorporates patients' insights obtained through focused group discussions across the BIG-NABCG networks. Considerations for the development of de-escalation trials for systemic adjuvant treatment, including noninferiority trial design, choice of end points, and prioritization of a patient's perspectives, are presented in this consensus article.",

IMpassion031 compared efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus placebo combined with nab-paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage TNBC. Methods: This double-blind, randomised, phase 3 study enrolled patients in 75 academic and community sites in 13 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated stage II-III histologically documented TNBC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy plus intravenous atezolizumab at 840 mg or placebo every 2 weeks. Chemotherapy comprised of nab-paclitaxel at 125 mg/m  every week for 12 weeks followed by doxorubicin at 60 mg/m  and cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m  every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, which was then followed by surgery. Stratification was by clinical breast cancer stage and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. Co-primary endpoints were pathological complete response in all-randomised (ie, all randomly assigned patients in the intention-to-treat population) and PD-L1-positive (ie, patients with PD-L1-expressing tumour infiltrating immune cells covering ≥1% of tumour area) populations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ), Eudra (CT2016-004734-22), and the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (JapicCTI-173630), and is ongoing. Results: Between July 7, 2017, and Sept 24, 2019, 455 patients were recruited and assessed for eligibility. Of the 333 eligible patients, 165 were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 168 to placebo plus chemotherapy. At data cutoff (April 3, 2020), median follow-up was 20·6 months (IQR 8·7-24·9) in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 19·8 months (8·1-24·5) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. Pathological complete response was documented in 95 (58%, 95% CI 50-65) patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 69 (41%, 34-49) patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (rate difference 17%, 95% CI 6-27; one-sided p=0·0044 [significance boundary 0·0184]). In the PD-L1-positive population, pathological complete response was documented in 53 (69%, 95% CI 57-79) of 77 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 37 (49%, 38-61) of 75 patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (rate difference 20%, 95% CI 4-35; one-sided p=0·021 [significance boundary 0·0184]). In the neoadjuvant phase, grade 3-4 adverse events were balanced and treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 37 (23%) and 26 (16%) patients, with one patient per group experiencing an unrelated grade 5 adverse event (traffic accident in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and pneumonia in the placebo plus chemotherapy group). Conclusion: In patients with early-stage TNBC, neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and anthracycline-based chemotherapy significantly improved pathological complete response rates with an acceptable safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Background: Previous studies of hypofractionated adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy for early breast cancer established a 15- or 16-fraction (fr) regimen as standard. The FAST Trial (CRUKE/04/015) evaluated normal tissue effects (NTE) and disease outcomes after 5-fr regimens. Ten-year results are presented. Methods: Women ≥ 50 years of age with low-risk invasive breast carcinoma (pT1-2 pN0) were randomly assigned to 50 Gy/25 fr (5 weeks) or 30 or 28.5 Gy in 5 once-weekly fr of 6.0 or 5.7 Gy. The primary end point was change in photographic breast appearance at 2 and 5 years; secondary end points were physician assessments of NTE and local tumor control. Odds ratios (ORs) from longitudinal analyses compared regimens. Results: A total of 915 women were recruited from 18 UK centers (2004-2007). Five-year photographs were available for 615/862 (71%) eligible patients. ORs for change in photographic breast appearance were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.49;   = .019) for 30 Gy and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.71;   = .686) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. α/β estimate for photographic end point was 2.7 Gy (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.9 Gy), giving a 5-fr schedule of 28 Gy (95% CI, 26 to 30 Gy) estimated to be isoeffective with 50 Gy/25 fr. ORs for any moderate/marked physician-assessed breast NTE (shrinkage, induration, telangiectasia, edema) were 2.12 (95% CI, 1.55 to 2.89;   < .001) for 30 Gy and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.72;   = .248) for 28.5 Gy versus 50 Gy. With 9.9 years median follow-up, 11 ipsilateral breast cancer events (50 Gy: 3; 30 Gy: 4; 28.5 Gy: 4) and 96 deaths (50 Gy: 30; 30 Gy: 33; 28.5 Gy: 33) have occurred. Conclusion: At 10 years, there was no significant difference in NTE rates after 28.5 Gy/5 fr compared with 50 Gy/25 fr, but NTE were higher after 30 Gy/5 fr. Results confirm the published 3-year findings that a once-weekly 5-fr schedule of whole-breast radiotherapy can be identified that appears to be radiobiologically comparable for NTE to a conventionally fractionated regimen.",

        "abstract": "Background: We aimed to identify a five-fraction schedule of adjuvant radiotherapy (radiation therapy) delivered in 1 week that is non-inferior in terms of local cancer control and is as safe as an international standard 15-fraction regimen after primary surgery for early breast cancer. Here, we present 5-year results of the FAST-Forward trial. Methods: FAST-Forward is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial done at 97 hospitals (47 radiotherapy centres and 50 referring hospitals) in the UK. Patients aged at least 18 years with invasive carcinoma of the breast (pT1-3, pN0-1, M0) after breast conservation surgery or mastectomy were eligible. We randomly allocated patients to either 40 Gy in 15 fractions (over 3 weeks), 27 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week), or 26 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week) to the whole breast or chest wall. Allocation was not masked because of the nature of the intervention. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour relapse; assuming a 2% 5-year incidence for 40 Gy, non-inferiority was predefined as ≤1·6% excess for five-fraction schedules (critical hazard ratio [HR] of 1·81). Normal tissue effects were assessed by clinicians, patients, and from photographs. This trial is registered at isrctn.com, ISRCTN19906132. Results: Between Nov 24, 2011, and June 19, 2014, we recruited and obtained consent from 4096 patients from 97 UK centres, of whom 1361 were assigned to the 40 Gy schedule, 1367 to the 27 Gy schedule, and 1368 to the 26 Gy schedule. At a median follow-up of 71·5 months (IQR 71·3 to 71·7), the primary endpoint event occurred in 79 patients (31 in the 40 Gy group, 27 in the 27 Gy group, and 21 in the 26 Gy group); HRs versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 0·86 (95% CI 0·51 to 1·44) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 0·67 (0·38 to 1·16) for 26 Gy in five fractions. 5-year incidence of ipsilateral breast tumour relapse after 40 Gy was 2·1% (1·4 to 3·1); estimated absolute differences versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were -0·3% (-1·0 to 0·9) for 27 Gy in five fractions (probability of incorrectly accepting an inferior five-fraction schedule: p=0·0022 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions) and -0·7% (-1·3 to 0·3) for 26 Gy in five fractions (p=0·00019 vs 40 Gy in 15 fractions). At 5 years, any moderate or marked clinician-assessed normal tissue effects in the breast or chest wall was reported for 98 of 986 (9·9%) 40 Gy patients, 155 (15·4%) of 1005 27 Gy patients, and 121 of 1020 (11·9%) 26 Gy patients. Across all clinician assessments from 1-5 years, odds ratios versus 40 Gy in 15 fractions were 1·55 (95% CI 1·32 to 1·83, p<0·0001) for 27 Gy in five fractions and 1·12 (0·94 to 1·34, p=0·20) for 26 Gy in five fractions. Patient and photographic assessments showed higher normal tissue effect risk for 27 Gy versus 40 Gy but not for 26 Gy versus 40 Gy. Conclusion: 26 Gy in five fractions over 1 week is non-inferior to the standard of 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for local tumour control, and is as safe in terms of normal tissue effects up to 5 years for patients prescribed adjuvant local radiotherapy after primary surgery for early-stage breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neratinib is an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for extended adjuvant treatment in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer based on the phase III ExteNET study. In that trial, in which no antidiarrheal prophylaxis was mandated, grade 3 diarrhea was observed in 40% of patients and 17% discontinued due to diarrhea. The international, open-label, sequential-cohort, phase II CONTROL study is investigating several strategies to improve tolerability. Methods: Patients who completed trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy received neratinib 240 mg/day for 1 year plus loperamide prophylaxis (days 1-28 or 1-56). Sequential cohorts evaluated additional budesonide or colestipol prophylaxis (days 1-28) and neratinib dose escalation (DE; ongoing). The primary end point was the incidence of grade ≥3 diarrhea. Results: Final data for loperamide (L; n = 137), budesonide + loperamide (BL; n = 64), colestipol + loperamide (CL; n = 136), and colestipol + as-needed loperamide (CL-PRN; n = 104) cohorts, and interim data for DE (n = 60; completed ≥six cycles or discontinued; median duration 11 months) are available. No grade 4 diarrhea was observed. Grade 3 diarrhea rates were lower than ExteNET in all cohorts and lowest in DE (L 31%, BL 28%, CL 21%, CL-PRN 32%, DE 15%). Median number of grade 3 diarrhea episodes was one; median duration per grade 3 episode was 1.0-2.0 days across cohorts. Most grade 3 diarrhea and diarrhea-related discontinuations occurred in month 1. Diarrhea-related discontinuations were lowest in DE (L 20%, BL 8%, CL 4%, CL-PRN 8%, DE 3%). Decreases in health-related quality of life did not cross the clinically important threshold. Conclusion: Neratinib tolerability was improved with preemptive prophylaxis or DE, which reduced the rate, severity, and duration of neratinib-associated grade ≥3 diarrhea compared with ExteNET. Lower diarrhea-related treatment discontinuations in multiple cohorts indicate that proactive management can allow patients to stay on neratinib for the recommended time period.

        "abstract": "Background: The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of intraoperative radiation therapy with electrons (IOERT) in breast conserving therapy (BCT), both as partial breast irradiation (PBI) as well as anticipated boost (\"IOERT-Boost\"). For both applications, the criteria for patient selection, technical details/requirements, physical aspects and outcome data are presented. IOERT AS PBI: The largest evidence comes from Italian studies, especially the ELIOT randomized trial. Investigators showed that the rate of in-breast relapses (IBR) in the IOERT group was significantly greater than with whole breast irradiation (WBI), even when within the pre-specified equivalence margin. Tumour sizes >2 cm, involved axillary nodes, Grade 3 and triple negative molecular subtypes emerged as statistically significant predictors of IBR. For patients at low risk for in-breast recurrence (ASTRO/ESTRO recommendations), full dose IOERT was isoeffective with standard WBI. Hence, several national guidelines now include this treatment strategy as one of the standard techniques for PBI in carefully selected patients. IOERT BOOST: The largest evidence for boost IOERT preceding WBI comes from pooled analyses performed by the European Group of the International Society of Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (ISIORT Europe), where single boost doses (mostly around 10 Gy) preceded whole-breast irradiation (WBI) with 50 Gy (conventional fractionation). At median follow-up periods up to ten years, local recurrence rates around 1% were observed for low risk tumours. Higher local relapse rates were described for grade 3 tumours, triple negative breast cancer as well as for patients treated after primary systemic therapy for locally advanced tumours. Even in this settings, long-term (>5y) local tumour control rates beyond 95% were achieved. These encouraging results are interpreted as being attributable to utmost precision in dose delivery (by avoiding a \"geographic and/or temporal miss\"), and the possible radiobiological superiority of a single high dose fraction, compared to the conventionally fractionated boost. IOERT also showed favourable results in terms of cosmetic outcome, assumedly thanks to the small treated volumes combined with complete skin sparing.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cancer and cardiovascular (CV) disease are the most prevalent diseases in the developed world. Evidence increasingly shows that these conditions are interlinked through common risk factors, coincident in an ageing population, and are connected biologically through some deleterious effects of anticancer treatment on CV health. Anticancer therapies can cause a wide spectrum of short- and long-term cardiotoxic effects. An explosion of novel cancer therapies has revolutionised this field and dramatically altered cancer prognosis. Nevertheless, these new therapies have introduced unexpected CV complications beyond heart failure. Common CV toxicities related to cancer therapy are defined, along with suggested strategies for prevention, detection and treatment. This ESMO consensus article proposes to define CV toxicities related to cancer or its therapies and provide guidance regarding prevention, screening, monitoring and treatment of CV toxicity. The majority of anticancer therapies are associated with some CV toxicity, ranging from asymptomatic and transient to more clinically significant and long-lasting cardiac events. It is critical however, that concerns about potential CV damage resulting from anticancer therapies should be weighed against the potential benefits of cancer therapy, including benefits in overall survival. CV disease in patients with cancer is complex and treatment needs to be individualised. The scope of cardio-oncology is wide and includes prevention, detection, monitoring and treatment of CV toxicity related to cancer therapy, and also ensuring the safe development of future novel cancer treatments that minimise the impact on CV health. It is anticipated that the management strategies discussed herein will be suitable for the majority of patients. Nonetheless, the clinical judgment of physicians remains extremely important; hence, when using these best clinical practices to inform treatment options and decisions, practitioners should also consider the individual circumstances of their patients on a case-by-case basis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to, and inhibits, the receptor activator of RANKL (TNFSF11) and might affect breast cancer biology, as shown by preclinical evidence. We aimed to assess whether denosumab combined with standard-of-care adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy and locoregional treatments would increase bone metastasis-free survival in women with breast cancer. Methods: In this international, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (D-CARE), patients were recruited from 389 centres in 39 countries. We enrolled women (aged ≥ 18 years) with histologically confirmed stage II or III breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. On eligibility confirmation, investigators at each site telephoned an interactive voice response system to centrally randomly assign patients (1:1) based on a fixed stratified permuted block randomisation list (block size 4) to receive either denosumab (120 mg) or matching placebo subcutaneously every 3-4 weeks, starting with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, for about 6 months and then every 12 weeks for a total duration of 5 years. Stratification factors were breast cancer therapy, lymph node status, hormone receptor and HER2 status, age, and geographical region. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between June 2, 2010, and Aug 24, 2012, 4509 women were randomly assigned to receive denosumab (n=2256) or placebo (n=2253) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

The primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (median not reached in either group; hazard ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·82-1·14; p=0·70). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events, reported in patients who had at least one dose of the investigational product (2241 patients with denosumab vs 2218 patients with placebo), were neutropenia (340 [15%] vs 328 [15%]), febrile neutropenia (112 [5%] vs 142 [6%]), and leucopenia (62 [3%] vs 61 [3%]). Positively adjudicated osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 122 (5%) of 2241 patients treated with denosumab versus four (<1%) of 2218 patients treated with placebo; treatment-emergent hypocalcaemia occurred in 152 (7%) versus 82 (4%). Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the placebo group due to acute myeloid leukaemia and depressed level of consciousness. Conclusion: Despite preclinical evidence suggesting RANKL inhibition might delay bone metastasis or disease recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer, in this study, denosumab did not improve disease-related outcomes for women with high-risk early breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: The sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (SN FNAC) study has shown that in node-positive (N+) breast cancer, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) can be performed following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), with a low false negative rate (FNR = 8.4%). A secondary endpoint of the SN FNAC study was to determine whether axillary ultrasound (AxUS) could predict axillary pathological complete response (ypN0) and increase the accuracy of SNB. Methods: The SN FNAC trial is a study of patients with biopsy-proven N+ breast cancer who underwent SNB followed by completion node dissection. All patients had AxUS following NAC and the axillary nodes were classified as either positive (AxUS+) or negative (AxUS-). AxUS was compared with the final axillary pathology results. Results: There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics of patients with AxUS+ versus those with AxUS-. Overall, 82.5% (47/57) of AxUS+ patients had residual positive lymph nodes (ypN+) at surgery and 53.8% (42/78) of AxUS- patients had ypN+. Post NAC AxUS sensitivity was 52.8%, specificity 78.3%, and negative predictive value 46.2%. AxUS FNR was 47.2%, versus 8.4% for SNB. If post-NAC AxUS- was used to select patients for SNB, FNR would decrease from 8.4 to 2.7%. However, using post-NAC AxUS in addition to SNB as an indication for ALND would have led to unnecessary ALND in 7.8% of all patients. Conclusion: AxUS is not appropriate as a standalone staging procedure, and SNB itself is sufficient to assess the axilla post NAC in patients who present with N+ breast cancer.",

Here, we report the planned final analysis based on the prespecified number of occurring events. Methods: PHARE is an open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority randomised trial of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer comparing 6 months versus 12 months of trastuzumab treatment concomitant with or following standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The study was undertaken in 156 centres in France. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast and either positive axillary nodes or negative axillary nodes but a tumour of at least 10 mm. Participants must have received at least four cycles of a chemotherapy for this breast cancer and have started receiving adjuvant trastuzumab-treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either 6 months or 12 months of trastuzumab therapy duration between the third and sixth months of adjuvant trastuzumab. The randomisation was stratified by concomitant or sequential treatment with chemotherapy, oestrogen receptor status, and centre. The primary objective was non-inferiority in the intention-to-treat population in the 6-month group in terms of disease-free survival with a prespecified hazard margin of 1·15. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: 3384 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 12 months (n=1691) or 6 months (n=1693) of adjuvant trastuzumab. One patient in the 12-month group and three patients in the 6-month group were excluded, so 1690 patients in each group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At a median follow-up of 7·5 years (IQR 5·3-8·8), 704 events relevant to disease-free survival were observed (345 [20·4%] in the 12-month group and 359 [21·2%] in the 6-month group). The adjusted hazard ratio for disease-free survival in the 12-month group versus the 6-month group was 1·08 (95% CI 0·93-1·25; p=0·39). The non-inferiority margin was included in the 95% CI. No differences in effects pertaining to trastuzumab duration were found in any of the subgroups. After the completion of trastuzumab treatment, rare adverse events occurred over time and the safety analysis remained similar to the previously published report. In particular, we found no change in the cardiac safety comparison, and only three additional cases in which the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased to less than 50% have been reported in the 12-month group. Conclusion: The PHARE study did not show the non-inferiority of 6 months versus 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab. Hence, adjuvant trastuzumab standard duration should remain 12 months.",

        "abstract": "Background: Adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improves outcomes for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The standard treatment duration is 12 months but shorter treatment could provide similar efficacy while reducing toxicities and cost. We aimed to investigate whether 6-month adjuvant trastuzumab treatment is non-inferior to the standard 12-month treatment regarding disease-free survival. Methods: This study is an open-label, randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial. Patients were recruited from 152 centres in the UK. We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, aged 18 years or older, and with a clear indication for chemotherapy, by a computerised minimisation process (1:1), to receive either 6-month or 12-month trastuzumab delivered every 3 weeks intravenously (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (600 mg), given in combination with chemotherapy (concurrently or sequentially). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat, with a non-inferiority margin of 3% for 4-year disease-free survival. Safety was analysed in all patients who received trastuzumab. This trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2006-007018-39), ISRCTN (number 52968807), and ClinicalTrials.gov (number  ). Results: Between Oct 4, 2007, and July 31, 2015, 2045 patients were assigned to 12-month trastuzumab treatment and 2044 to 6-month treatment (one patient was excluded because they were double randomised). Median follow-up was 5·4 years (IQR 3·6-6·7) for both treatment groups, during which a disease-free survival event occurred in 265 (13%) of 2043 patients in the 6-month group and 247 (12%) of 2045 patients in the 12-month group. 4-year disease-free survival was 89·4% (95% CI 87·9-90·7) in the 6-month group and 89·8% (88·3-91·1) in the 12-month group (hazard ratio 1·07 [90% CI 0·93-1·24], non-inferiority p=0·011), showing non-inferiority of the 6-month treatment. 6-month trastuzumab treatment resulted in fewer patients reporting severe adverse events (373 [19%] of 1939 patients vs 459 [24%] of 1894 patients, p=0·0002) or stopping early because of cardiotoxicity (61 [3%] of 1939 patients vs 146 [8%] of 1894 patients, p<0·0001). Conclusion: We have shown that 6-month trastuzumab treatment is non-inferior to 12-month treatment in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, with less cardiotoxicity and fewer severe adverse events. These results support consideration of reduced duration trastuzumab for women at similar risk of recurrence as to those included in the trial.",

Here, we report data on long-term outcomes. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed primary BC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 12 times weekly NAB-paclitaxel 150 mg/m  (after study amendment, 125 mg/m ) or weekly sb-paclitaxel 80 mg/m  followed in both arms by four times epirubicin 90 mg/m  plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m  every 3 weeks. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC received dual antibody treatment with trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) concurrently to chemotherapy and continued for 1 year. Results: A total of 1,206 patients started treatment, 606 with NAB-paclitaxel and 600 with sb-paclitaxel. After a median follow-up of 49.6 months (range, 0.5 to 64.0 months), 243 invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) events were reported (143 in the sb-paclitaxel and 100 in the NAB-paclitaxel arm). At 4 years, overall patients treated with NAB-paclitaxel had a significantly better iDFS compared with sb-paclitaxel (84.0%   76.3%; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.86;   = .002), whereas overall survival did not significantly differ between the two treatment arms (89.7%   87.2%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.16;   = .260). Long-term follow-up of the treatment-related peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) showed a significant decrease of the median time to resolve PSN after NAB-paclitaxel 125 mg/m  compared with NAB-paclitaxel 150 mg/m . Conclusion: The significantly higher pathologic complete response rate with NAB-paclitaxel translated into a significantly improved iDFS in patients with early BC as compared with sb-paclitaxel. PSN improved much faster under NAB-paclitaxel 125 mg/m  compared with NAB-paclitaxel 150 mg/m .",

        "abstract": "Background: Increasing the dose intensity of cytotoxic therapy by shortening the intervals between cycles, or by giving individual drugs sequentially at full dose rather than in lower-dose concurrent treatment schedules, might enhance efficacy. Methods: To clarify the relative benefits and risks of dose-intense and standard-schedule chemotherapy in early breast cancer, we did an individual patient-level meta-analysis of trials comparing 2-weekly versus standard 3-weekly schedules, and of trials comparing sequential versus concurrent administration of anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, and trial, yielded dose-intense versus standard-schedule first-event rate ratios (RRs). Results: Individual patient data were provided for 26 of 33 relevant trials identified, comprising 37 298 (93%) of 40 070 women randomised. Most women were aged younger than 70 years and had node-positive disease. Total cytotoxic drug usage was broadly comparable in the two treatment arms; colony-stimulating factor was generally used in the more dose-intense arm. Combining data from all 26 trials, fewer breast cancer recurrences were seen with dose-intense than with standard-schedule chemotherapy (10-year recurrence risk 28·0% vs 31·4%; RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·82-0·89; p<0·0001). 10-year breast cancer mortality was similarly reduced (18·9% vs 21·3%; RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·83-0·92; p<0·0001), as was all-cause mortality (22·1% vs 24·8%; RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·83-0·91; p<0·0001). Death without recurrence was, if anything, lower with dose-intense than with standard-schedule chemotherapy (10-year risk 4·1% vs 4·6%; RR 0·88, 95% CI 0·78-0·99; p=0·034). Recurrence reductions were similar in the seven trials (n=10 004) that compared 2-weekly chemotherapy with the same chemotherapy given 3-weekly (10-year risk 24·0% vs 28·3%; RR 0·83, 95% CI 0·76-0·91; p<0·0001), in the six trials (n=11 028) of sequential versus concurrent anthracycline plus taxane chemotherapy (28·1% vs 31·3%; RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·80-0·94; p=0·0006), and in the six trials (n=6532) testing both shorter intervals and sequential administration (30·4% vs 35·0%; RR 0·82, 95% CI 0·74-0·90; p<0·0001). The proportional reductions in recurrence with dose-intense chemotherapy were similar and highly significant (p<0·0001) in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative disease and did not differ significantly by other patient or tumour characteristics. Conclusion: Increasing the dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy by shortening the interval between treatment cycles, or by giving individual drugs sequentially rather than giving the same drugs concurrently, moderately reduces the 10-year risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer without increasing mortality from other causes.",

        "abstract": "Background: During the last two decades the number of breast implants used in aesthetic, oncologic and risk reducing surgery has increased substantially mainly due to the improvement and confirmed safety of these devices. Since identification of the first case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma associated with a breast implant (BIA-ALCL) 20 years ago, there has been an increase in the number of reports of this very rare disease, demonstrating a clear association with breast implants. Whilst the majority of cases are localised and cured by implant removal and full capsulectomy, a small percentage require chemotherapy and the mortality rate is very low. The evidence linking BIA-ALCL to implant surface texturing, as the majority of cases were diagnosed in patients with textured implants, has raised concerns about the long term safety of these devices resulting in patient and regulatory authority concerns globally. We hereby present the current published knowledge about the link between BIA-ALCL and implant surface texture and a review of current regulatory and professional body advice across Europe, which may enable a better understanding of this rare disease, how to manage and ultimately prevent it. We conclude by giving EUSOMA recommendation, towards the unnecessary change in attitudes towards implant based surgery, according to the most recent available published evidence as long as patients are properly informed about the risk of BIA-ALCL.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients who have residual invasive breast cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy have a worse prognosis than those who have no residual cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate of trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent emtansine (DM1), a maytansine derivative and microtubule inhibitor, provides benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer that was previously treated with chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy. Methods: We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial involving patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were found to have residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy containing a taxane (with or without anthracycline) and trastuzumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause). Results: At the interim analysis, among 1486 randomly assigned patients (743 in the T-DM1 group and 743 in the trastuzumab group), invasive disease or death had occurred in 91 patients in the T-DM1 group (12.2%) and 165 patients in the trastuzumab group (22.2%). The estimated percentage of patients who were free of invasive disease at 3 years was 88.3% in the T-DM1 group and 77.0% in the trastuzumab group. Invasive disease-free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001). Distant recurrence as the first invasive-disease event occurred in 10.5% of patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.9% of those in the trastuzumab group. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of T-DM1, with more adverse events associated with T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone. Conclusion: Among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who had residual invasive disease after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the risk of recurrence of invasive breast cancer or death was 50% lower with adjuvant T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone.

        "abstract": "Background: GANEA2 study was designed to assess accuracy and safety of sentinel lymph node (SLN) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients. Methods: Early breast cancer patients treated with NAC were included. Before NAC, patients with cytologically proven node involvement were allocated into the pN1 group, other patient were allocated into the cN0 group. After NAC, pN1 group patients underwent SLN and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); cN0 group patients underwent SLN and ALND only in case of mapping failure or SLN involvement. The main endpoint was SLN false negative rate (FNR). Secondary endpoints were predictive factors for remaining positive ALND and survival of patients treated with SLN alone. Results: From 2010 to 2014, 957 patients were included. Among the 419 patients from the cN0 group treated with SLN alone, one axillary relapse occurred during the follow-up. Among pN1 group patients, with successful mapping, 103 had a negative SLN. The FNR was 11.9% (95% CI 7.3-17.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that residual breast tumor size after NAC ≥ 5 mm and lympho-vascular invasion remained independent predictors for involved ALND. For patients with initially involved node, with negative SLN after NAC, no lympho-vascular invasion and a remaining breast tumor size 5 mm, the risk of a positive ALND is 3.7% regardless the number of SLN removed. Conclusion: In patients with no initial node involvement, negative SLN after NAC allows to safely avoid an ALND. Residual breast tumor and lympho-vascular invasion after NAC allow identifying patients with initially involved node with a low risk of ALND involvement.",

        "abstract": "Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease, but recent studies have identified heterogeneity in patient outcomes. However, the utility of histologic subtyping in TNBC has not yet been well-characterised. This study utilises data from the National Cancer Center Database (NCDB) to complete the largest series to date investigating the prognostic importance of histology within TNBC. Methods: A total of 729,920 patients (pts) with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC), medullary breast carcinoma (MedBC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) or apocrine breast carcinoma (ABC) treated between 2004 and 2012 were identified in the NCDB. Of these, 89,222 pts with TNBC that received surgery were analysed. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank testing and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were utilised with overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome. Results: MBC (74.1%), MedBC (60.6%), ACC (75.7%), ABC (50.1%) and ILC (1.8%) had significantly different proportions of triple negativity when compared to IDC (14.0%, p < 0.001). TNBC predicted an inferior OS in IDC (p < 0.001) and ILC (p < 0.001). Lumpectomy and radiation (RT) were more common in MedBC (51.7%) and ACC (51.5%) and less common in MBC (33.1%) and ILC (25.4%), when compared to IDC (42.5%, p < 0.001). TNBC patients with MBC (HR 1.39, p < 0.001), MedBC (HR 0.42, p < 0.001) and ACC (HR 0.32, p = 0.003) differed significantly in OS when compared to IDC. Conclusion: Our results indicate that histologic heterogeneity in TNBC significantly informs patient outcomes and thus, has the potential to aid in the development of optimum personalised treatments.",

        "abstract": "Background: Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has a higher false-negative rate than in the primary surgical setting, particularly for small tumor deposits. Additional tumor burden seen with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and micrometastases following primary surgery is low; however, it is unknown whether the same is true after NAC. We examined the false-negative rate of intraoperative frozen section (FS) after NAC, and the association between SLN metastasis size and residual disease at axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Methods: Patients undergoing SLN biopsy after NAC were identified. The association between SLN metastasis size and residual axillary disease was examined. Results: From July 2008 to July 2017, 702 patients (711 cancers) had SLN biopsy after NAC. On FS, 181 had metastases, 530 were negative; 33 negative cases were positive on final pathology (false-negative rate 6.2%). Among patients with a positive FS, 3 (2%) had ITCs and no further disease on ALND; 41 (23%) had micrometastases and 125 (69%) had macrometastases. Fifty-nine percent of patients with micrometastases and 63% with macrometastases had one or more additional positive nodes at ALND. Among those with a false-negative result, 10 (30%) had ITCs, 15 (46%) had micrometastases, and 8 (24%) had macrometastases; 17 had ALND and 59% had one or more additional positive lymph nodes. Overall, 1/6 (17%) patients with ITCs and 28/44 (64%) patients with micrometastases had additional nodal metastases at ALND. Conclusion: Low-volume SLN disease after NAC is not an indicator of a low risk of additional positive axillary nodes and remains an indication for ALND, even when not detected on intraoperative FS.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although several randomised trials in patients with triple-negative breast cancer have shown that the addition of carboplatin, with or without poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the likelihood of achieving a pathological complete response, the use of these therapies in this setting has remained controversial. The BrighTNess trial was designed to assess the addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib plus carboplatin or carboplatin alone to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (BrighTNess) across 145 sites in 15 countries. Patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated histologically or cytologically confirmed clinical stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer, who were candidates for potentially curative surgery and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, were randomly assigned (2:1:1) by an interactive response technology system via permuted blocks (block size of four) within strata to receive one of three segment 1 regimens: paclitaxel (80 mg/m  intravenously weekly for 12 doses) plus carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL per min, intravenously every 3 weeks, for four cycles) plus veliparib (50 mg orally, twice a day); paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib placebo (twice a day); or paclitaxel plus carboplatin placebo (every 3 weeks for four cycles) plus veliparib placebo. Following segment 1, all patients were assigned to segment 2 in which they received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2-3 weeks for four cycles. Randomisation for segment 1 was stratified by germline BRCA mutation status, nodal stage, and planned schedule of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide administration. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response in breast and lymph nodes as determined by site pathologists following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. These are the first results of an ongoing clinical trial; the data cutoff for the analyses presented was Dec 8, 2016. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between April 4, 2014, and March 18, 2016, 634 patients were randomly assigned: 316 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib, 160 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin, and 158 to paclitaxel alone. The proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response was higher in the paclitaxel, carboplatin, and veliparib group than in patients receiving paclitaxel alone (168 [53%] of 316 patients vs 49 [31%] of 158, p<0·0001), but not compared with patients receiving paclitaxel plus carboplatin (92 [58%] of 160 patients, p=0·36). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and serious adverse events were more common in patients receiving carboplatin, whereas veliparib did not substantially increase toxicity. The most common grade 3 or 4 events overall were neutropenia (352 [56%] of 628 patients), anaemia (180 [29%]), and thrombocytopenia (75 [12%]) through complete treatment, and febrile neutropenia (88 [15%] of 601 patients) during segment 2. The most common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (80 [13%] of 628 patients) and anaemia (20 [3%]). Conclusion: Although the addition of veliparib and carboplatin to paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improved the proportion of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who achieved a pathological complete response, the addition of veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel did not. Increased toxicities with the addition of carboplatin (with or without veliparib) to paclitaxel were manageable and did not substantially affect treatment delivery of paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Given the consistent results with previous studies, the addition of carboplatin appears to have a favourable risk to benefit profile and might be considered as a potential component of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk, triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: ExteNET showed that 1 year of neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly improves 2-year invasive disease-free survival after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. We report updated efficacy outcomes from a protocol-defined 5-year follow-up sensitivity analysis and long-term toxicity findings. Methods: In this ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, eligible women aged 18 years or older (≥20 years in Japan) with stage 1-3c (modified to stage 2-3c in February, 2010) operable breast cancer, who had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with no evidence of disease recurrence or metastatic disease at study entry. Patients who were eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via permuted blocks stratified according to hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive vs hormone receptor-negative), nodal status (0 vs 1-3 vs or ≥4 positive nodes), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (given sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system, to receive 1 year of oral neratinib 240 mg/day or matching placebo. Treatment was given continuously for 1 year, unless disease recurrence or new breast cancer, intolerable adverse events, or consent withdrawal occurred. Patients, investigators, and trial funder were masked to treatment allocation. The predefined endpoint of the 5-year analysis was invasive disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat. ExteNET is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and is closed to new participants. Results: Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, 2840 eligible women with early HER2-positive breast cancer were recruited from community-based and academic institutions in 40 countries and randomly assigned to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). After a median follow-up of 5·2 years (IQR 2·1-5·3), patients in the neratinib group had significantly fewer invasive disease-free survival events than those in the placebo group (116 vs 163 events; stratified hazard ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·57-0·92, p=0·0083). The 5-year invasive disease-free survival was 90·2% (95% CI 88·3-91·8) in the neratinib group and 87·7% (85·7-89·4) in the placebo group. Without diarrhoea prophylaxis, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the neratinib group, compared with the placebo group, were diarrhoea (561 [40%] grade 3 and one [<1%] grade 4 with neratinib vs 23 [2%] grade 3 with placebo), vomiting (grade 3: 47 [3%] vs five [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3: 26 [2%] vs two [<1%]). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred in 103 (7%) women in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) women in the placebo group. No evidence of increased risk of long-term toxicity or long-term adverse consequences of neratinib-associated diarrhoea were identified with neratinib compared with placebo. Conclusion: At the 5-year follow-up, 1 year of extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib, administered after chemotherapy and trastuzumab, significantly reduced the proportion of clinically relevant breast cancer relapses-ie, those that might lead to death, such as distant and locoregional relapses outside the preserved breast-without increasing the risk of long-term toxicity. An analysis of overall survival is planned after 248 events.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast-conserving therapy, involving breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation and optionally a boost to the tumour bed, is a standard therapeutic option for women with early-stage breast cancer. A boost to the tumour bed means that an extra dose of radiation is applied that covers the initial tumour site. The rationale for a boost of radiotherapy to the tumour bed is that (i) local recurrence occurs mostly at the site of the primary tumour because remaining microscopic tumour cells are most likely situated there; and (ii) radiation can eliminate these causative microscopic tumour cells. The boost continues to be used in women at high risk of local recurrence, but is less widely accepted for women at lower risk. Reasons for questioning the boost are twofold. Firstly, the boost brings higher treatment costs. Secondly, the potential adverse events are not negligible. In this Cochrane Review, we investigated the effect of the tumour bed boost on local control and side effects. Methods: To assess the effects of tumour bed boost radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation for the treatment of breast cancer. Results: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 1 March 2017), Embase (1980 to 1 March 2017), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 March 2017. We also searched the European Society of Radiotherapy and Oncology Annual Meeting, the St Gallen Oncology Conferences, and the American Society for Radiation Oncology Annual Meeting for abstracts.

        "abstract": "Background: Local cancer relapse risk after breast conservation surgery followed by radiotherapy has fallen sharply in many countries, and is influenced by patient age and clinicopathological factors. We hypothesise that partial-breast radiotherapy restricted to the vicinity of the original tumour in women at lower than average risk of local relapse will improve the balance of beneficial versus adverse effects compared with whole-breast radiotherapy. Methods: IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done in 30 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Women aged 50 years or older who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for unifocal invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of grade 1-3, with a tumour size of 3 cm or less (pT1-2), none to three positive axillary nodes (pN0-1), and minimum microscopic margins of non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy and 40 Gy to the partial breast (reduced-dose group), or 40 Gy to the partial breast only (partial-breast group) in 15 daily treatment fractions. Computer-generated random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were used to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by radiotherapy treatment centre. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. Field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered using standard tangential beams that were simply reduced in length for the partial-breast group. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local relapse (80% power to exclude a 2·5% increase [non-inferiority margin] at 5 years for each experimental group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the local relapse hazard ratio [HR] was less than 2·03), analysed by intention to treat. Safety analyses were done in all patients for whom data was available (ie, a modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN12852634. Results: Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 women were recruited. Two women withdrew consent for use of their data in the analysis. 674 patients were analysed in the whole-breast radiotherapy (control) group, 673 in the reduced-dose group, and 669 in the partial-breast group. Median follow-up was 72·2 months (IQR 61·7-83·2), and 5-year estimates of local relapse cumulative incidence were 1·1% (95% CI 0·5-2·3) of patients in the control group, 0·2% (0·02-1·2) in the reduced-dose group, and 0·5% (0·2-1·4) in the partial-breast group. Estimated 5-year absolute differences in local relapse compared with the control group were -0·73% (-0·99 to 0·22) for the reduced-dose and -0·38% (-0·84 to 0·90) for the partial-breast groups. Non-inferiority can be claimed for both reduced-dose and partial-breast radiotherapy, and was confirmed by the test against the critical HR being more than 2·03 (p=0·003 for the reduced-dose group and p=0·016 for the partial-breast group, compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy group). Photographic, patient, and clinical assessments recorded similar adverse effects after reduced-dose or partial-breast radiotherapy, including two patient domains achieving statistically significantly lower adverse effects (change in breast appearance [p=0·007 for partial-breast] and breast harder or firmer [p=0·002 for reduced-dose and p<0·0001 for partial-breast]) compared with whole-breast radiotherapy. Conclusion: We showed non-inferiority of partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy compared with the standard whole-breast radiotherapy in terms of local relapse in a cohort of patients with early breast cancer, and equivalent or fewer late normal-tissue adverse effects were seen. This simple radiotherapy technique is implementable in radiotherapy centres worldwide.",

Methods: Female patients with cT0 N1/2 M0 BC were selected from the National Cancer Database (2004-2013) and categorized into four treatment groups: MAST = mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) ± radiation (RT); RT + ALND = RT with ALND, no breast surgery; ALND = ALND alone; OBS = no breast surgery, RT, or ALND. Patient characteristics and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups, and multivariable analysis was used to identify factors associated with treatment and OS. Results: Among 2.03 million BC cases, 1853 females (0.09%) with cT0 N1/2 M0 disease were identified and 1231 patients were categorized into a treatment group: MAST = 592, RT + ALND = 342, ALND = 106, OBS = 191. On logistic regression, care at an academic center was associated with a higher likelihood of RT + ALND compared with MAST (odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-2.74, p < 0.001). Patients treated with RT + ALND had significantly better OS on univariate survival analysis compared with patients treated with MAST (hazard ratio [HR] 0.475, 95% CI 0.306-0.736, p = 0.001). RT + ALND was independently associated with OS on multivariable survival analysis (HR 0.509, 95% CI 0.321-0.808, p = 0.004), after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: Patients with OBC were more likely to undergo RT + ALND if they received care at an academic center. Patients treated with RT + ALND had significantly better OS compared with patients treated with MAST, after adjusting for covariates. This supports the use of RT + ALND as LR treatment for patients with OBC.",

Whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status affects treatment outcome remains elusive. Methods: To determine whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status affects therapy response in patients with TNBC. Results: This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial used archived DNA samples and cancer family history of 315 patients with TNBC enrolled between August 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, in the GeparSixto trial. In all, 291 participants (92.4%) were included in this multicenter prospective investigation. DNA samples were analyzed for germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and 16 other cancer predisposition genes. The pCR rates between the carboplatin and noncarboplatin arms were compared. Genetic analyses were performed at the Center for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Cologne, Germany; data analysis, November 1 through December 31, 2015. Conclusion: Proportion of patients who achieved pCR and disease-free survival after neoadjuvant treatment according to BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status. For pCR rates, the ypT0/is ypN0 definition was used as a primary end point.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pertuzumab increases the rate of pathological complete response in the preoperative context and increases overall survival among patients with metastatic disease when it is added to trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. In this trial, we investigated whether pertuzumab, when added to adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy, improves outcomes among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative HER2-positive, operable breast cancer to receive either pertuzumab or placebo added to standard adjuvant chemotherapy plus 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab. We assumed a 3-year invasive-disease-free survival rate of 91.8% with pertuzumab and 89.2% with placebo. Results: In the trial population, 63% of the patients who were randomly assigned to receive pertuzumab (2400 patients) or placebo (2405 patients) had node-positive disease and 36% had hormone-receptor-negative disease. Disease recurrence occurred in 171 patients (7.1%) in the pertuzumab group and 210 patients (8.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.00; P=0.045). The estimates of the 3-year rates of invasive-disease-free survival were 94.1% in the pertuzumab group and 93.2% in the placebo group. In the cohort of patients with node-positive disease, the 3-year rate of invasive-disease-free survival was 92.0% in the pertuzumab group, as compared with 90.2% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for an invasive-disease event, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02). In the cohort of patients with node-negative disease, the 3-year rate of invasive-disease-free survival was 97.5% in the pertuzumab group and 98.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for an invasive-disease event, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.86; P=0.64). Heart failure, cardiac death, and cardiac dysfunction were infrequent in both treatment groups. Diarrhea of grade 3 or higher occurred almost exclusively during chemotherapy and was more frequent with pertuzumab than with placebo (9.8% vs. 3.7%). Conclusion: Pertuzumab significantly improved the rates of invasive-disease-free survival among patients with HER2-positive, operable breast cancer when it was added to trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Diarrhea was more common with pertuzumab than with placebo. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; APHINITY ClinicalTrials.gov number,   .).",

        "abstract": "Background: The National Institute of Oncology, Budapest conducted a single centre randomized clinical study. The OTOASOR (Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla - Surgery Or Radiotherapy) trial compares completion of axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) to regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis (pN1sn) in stage I-II breast cancer. Methods: Patients with primary invasive breast cancer (cN0 and cT ≤ 3 cm) were randomized before surgery for cALND (standard treatment) or RNI (investigational treatment). Sentinel lymph nodes (SN) were investigated with serial sectioning at 0.5 mm levels by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Investigational treatment arm patients received 50 Gy RNI instead of cALND. Adjuvant treatment and follow up were performed according to the actual guidelines. Between August 2002 and June 2009, 1054 patients were randomized for cALND and 1052 patients for RNI. SN was evaluated in 2073 patients and was positive in 526 patients (25.4%). 474 cases were evaluable (244 in the cALND and 230 in the RNI arm), and in the cALND group 94 of 244 patients (38.5%) who underwent completion axillary surgery has additional positive nodes. The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors. Primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Mean follow-up was 97 months (Q1-Q3: 80-120). Axillary recurrence was 2.0% in cALND arm vs. 1.7% in RNI arm (p = 1.00). OS at 8 years was 77.9% vs. 84.8% (p = 0.060), and DFS was 72.1% in cALND arm and 77.4% after RNI (p = 0.51). The results show that RNI is statistically not inferior to cALND treatment. Conclusion: The long term follow-up results of this prospective-randomized trial suggest that RNI without cALND does not increase the risk of axillary failure in selected patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (cT ≤ 3 cm, cN0) and pN1(sn). Axillary radiotherapy should be an alternative treatment for selected patients with sentinel lymph node metastases.",

An Update Panel reviewed the identified abstracts. Results Of the eight publications identified and reviewed, none prompted a change in the 2014 recommendations, which are reaffirmed by the updated literature review. Conclusion Women without sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases should not receive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Women with one to two metastatic SLNs who are planning to undergo breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy should not undergo ALND (in most cases). Women with SLN metastases who will undergo mastectomy should be offered ALND. These three recommendations are based on randomized controlled trials. Women with operable breast cancer and multicentric tumors, with ductal carcinoma in situ, who will undergo mastectomy, who previously underwent breast and/or axillary surgery, or who received preoperative/neoadjuvant systemic therapy may be offered SNB.

        "abstract": "Background: Recent discussion has suggested that some cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with high risk of invasive disease may require sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Methods: Systematic literature review identified 48 studies (9,803 DCIS patients who underwent SLNB). Separate analyses for patients diagnosed preoperatively by core sampling and patients diagnosed postoperatively by specimen pathology were conducted to determine the percentage of patients with axillary nodal involvement. Patient factors were analyzed for associations with risk of nodal involvement. Results: The mean percentage of positive SLNBs was higher in the preoperative group (5.95% vs 3.02%; P = .0201). Meta-regression analysis showed a direct association with tumor size (P = .0333) and grade (P = .00839) but not median age nor tumor upstage rate. Conclusion: The SLNB should be routinely considered in patients with large (>2 cm) high-grade DCIS after a careful multidisciplinary discussion. In the context of breast conserving surgery, the SLNB is not routinely indicated for low- and intermediate-grade DCIS, high-grade DCIS smaller than 2 cm, or pure DCIS diagnosed by definitive surgical excision.",

Methods A multidisciplinary consensus panel used a meta-analysis of margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) from a systematic review of 20 studies including 7883 patients and other published literature as the evidence base for consensus. Results Negative margins halve the risk of IBTR compared with positive margins defined as ink on DCIS. A 2 mm margin minimizes the risk of IBTR compared with smaller negative margins. More widely clear margins do not significantly decrease IBTR compared with 2 mm margins. Negative margins less than 2 mm alone are not an indication for mastectomy, and factors known to impact rates of IBTR should be considered in determining the need for re-excision. Conclusion The use of a 2 mm margin as the standard for an adequate margin in DCIS treated with WBRT is associated with low rates of IBTR and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcome, and decrease health care costs. Clinical judgment should be used in determining the need for further surgery in patients with negative margins < 2 mm.",

Here, we report 5-year progression-free survival, disease-free survival, and safety. Methods: In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 randomised trial in hospitals and medical clinics, treatment-naive adults with locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, increasing to 100 mg/m(2) from cycle 2 if tolerated; group A), pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B), pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C), or pertuzumab and docetaxel (group D). After surgery, patients received three cycles of FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks (patients in group C received four cycles of docetaxel prior to FEC), and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks to complete 1 year's treatment (17 cycles in total). Randomisation was done by a central centre using dynamic allocation, stratified by operable, locally advanced, and inflammatory breast cancer, and by oestrogen and/or progesterone receptor positivity. Safety analyses were done according to treatment received. The primary endpoint (pathological complete response) was previously reported; secondary endpoints reported here are 5-year progression-free survival (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and disease-free survival (analysed in patients who had surgery). Secondary and exploratory analyses were not powered for formal statistical hypothesis testing, and therefore results are for descriptive purposes only. The study ended on Sept 22, 2014 (last patient, last visit). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between Dec 17, 2007, and Dec 22, 2009, 417 eligible patients were randomly assigned to group A (107 patients), group B (107 patients), group C (107 patients), or group D (96 patients). One patient in group A withdrew before treatment. One patient assigned to group D received group A treatment, one patient assigned to group D received group B treatment, and one patient assigned to group B received group C treatment. At clinical cutoff, 87 patients had progressed or died. 5-year progression-free survival rates were 81% (95% CI 71-87) for group A, 86% (77-91) for group B, 73% (64-81) for group C, and 73% (63-81) for group D (hazard ratios 0·69 [95% CI 0·34-1·40] group B vs group A, 1·25 [0·68-2·30] group C vs group A, and 2·05 [1·07-3·93] group D vs group B). Disease-free survival results were consistent with progression-free survival results and were 81% (95% CI 72-88) for group A, 84% (72-91) for group B, 80% (70-86) for group C, and 75% (64-83) for group D. Patients who achieved total pathological complete response (all groups combined) had longer progression-free survival compared with patients who did not (85% [76-91] in patients who achieved total pathological response vs 76% [71-81] in patients who did not achieve total pathological response; hazard ratio 0·54 [95% CI 0·29-1·00]). There were no new or long-term safety concerns and tolerability was similar across groups (neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment periods combined). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (group A: 71 [66%] of 107 patients; group B: 59 [55%] of 107; group C: 40 [37%] of 108; group D: 60 [64%] of 94), febrile neutropenia (group A: 10 [9%]; group B: 12 [11%]; group C: 5 [5%]; group D: 15 [16%]), and leucopenia (group A: 13 [12%]; group B: 6 [6%]; group C: 4 [4%]; group D: 8 [9%]). The number of patients with one or more serious adverse event was similar across groups (19-22 serious adverse events per group in 18-22% of patients). Conclusion: Progression-free survival and disease-free survival at 5-year follow-up show large and overlapping CIs, but support the primary endpoint (pathological complete response) and suggest that neoadjuvant pertuzumab is beneficial when combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Additionally, they suggest that total pathological complete response could be an early indicator of long-term outcome in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ is currently managed with excision, radiotherapy, and adjuvant hormone therapy, usually tamoxifen. We postulated that an aromatase inhibitor would be safer and more effective. We therefore undertook this trial to compare anastrozole versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing lumpectomy plus radiotherapy. Methods: The double-blind, randomised, phase 3 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-35 trial was done in 333 participating NSABP centres in the USA and Canada. Postmenopausal women with hormone-positive ductal carcinoma in situ treated by lumpectomy with clear resection margins and whole-breast irradiation were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral tamoxifen 20 mg per day (with matching placebo in place of anastrozole) or oral anastrozole 1 mg per day (with matching placebo in place of tamoxifen) for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by age (<60 vs ≥60 years) and patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was breast cancer-free interval, defined as time from randomisation to any breast cancer event (local, regional, or distant recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer, invasive disease, or ductal carcinoma in situ), analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , and is complete. Results: Between Jan 1, 2003, and June 15, 2006, 3104 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (1552 to tamoxifen and 1552 to anastrozole). As of Feb 28, 2015, follow-up information was available for 3083 patients for overall survival and 3077 for all other disease-free endpoints, with median follow-up of 9·0 years (IQR 8·2-10·0). In total, 212 breast cancer-free interval events occurred: 122 in the tamoxifen group and 90 in the anastrozole group (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·56-0·96], p=0·0234). A significant time-by-treatment interaction (p=0·0410) became evident later in the study. There was also a significant interaction between treatment and age group (p=0·0379), showing that anastrozole is superior only in women younger than 60 years of age. Adverse events did not differ between the groups, except for thrombosis or embolism--a known side-effect of tamoxifen-for which there were 17 grade 4 or worse events in the tamoxifen group versus four in the anastrozole group. Conclusion: Compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole treatment provided a significant improvement in breast cancer-free interval, mainly in women younger than 60 years of age. This finding means that women will benefit from having a choice of effective agents for ductal carcinoma in situ.",

        "abstract": "Background: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS. Methods: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS. Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten). All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours. All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals. This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358. Results: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed). Median follow-up was 7·2 years (IQR 5·6-8·9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded. We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·64-1·23]). The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1·25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0·49). A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·58-1·50], p=0·78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other. The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen. Conclusion: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments. Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen. Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.",

        "abstract": "Background: The optimal ways of using aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen as endocrine treatment for early breast cancer remains uncertain. Methods: We undertook meta-analyses of individual data on 31,920 postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive early breast cancer in the randomised trials of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 5 years of tamoxifen; of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 2-3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5; and of 2-3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5 versus 5 years of tamoxifen. Primary outcomes were any recurrence of breast cancer, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, and trial, yielded aromatase inhibitor versus tamoxifen first-event rate ratios (RRs). Results: In the comparison of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 5 years of tamoxifen, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors significantly during years 0-1 (RR 0·64, 95% CI 0·52-0·78) and 2-4 (RR 0·80, 0·68-0·93), and non-significantly thereafter. 10-year breast cancer mortality was lower with aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen (12·1% vs 14·2%; RR 0·85, 0·75-0·96; 2p=0·009). In the comparison of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 2-3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors significantly during years 0-1 (RR 0·74, 0·62-0·89) but not while both groups received aromatase inhibitors during years 2-4, or thereafter; overall in these trials, there were fewer recurrences with 5 years of aromatase inhibitors than with tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitors (RR 0·90, 0·81-0·99; 2p=0·045), though the breast cancer mortality reduction was not significant (RR 0·89, 0·78-1·03; 2p=0·11). In the comparison of 2-3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5 versus 5 years of tamoxifen, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors significantly during years 2-4 (RR 0·56, 0·46-0·67) but not subsequently, and 10-year breast cancer mortality was lower with switching to aromatase inhibitors than with remaining on tamoxifen (8·7% vs 10·1%; 2p=0·015). Aggregating all three types of comparison, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors during periods when treatments differed (RR 0·70, 0·64-0·77), but not significantly thereafter (RR 0·93, 0·86-1·01; 2p=0·08). Breast cancer mortality was reduced both while treatments differed (RR 0·79, 0·67-0·92), and subsequently (RR 0·89, 0·81-0·99), and for all periods combined (RR 0·86, 0·80-0·94; 2p=0·0005). All-cause mortality was also reduced (RR 0·88, 0·82-0·94; 2p=0·0003). RRs differed little by age, body-mass index, stage, grade, progesterone receptor status, or HER2 status. There were fewer endometrial cancers with aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen (10-year incidence 0·4% vs 1·2%; RR 0·33, 0·21-0·51) but more bone fractures (5-year risk 8·2% vs 5·5%; RR 1·42, 1·28-1·57); non-breast-cancer mortality was similar. Conclusion: Aromatase inhibitors reduce recurrence rates by about 30% (proportionately) compared with tamoxifen while treatments differ, but not thereafter. 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor reduces 10-year breast cancer mortality rates by about 15% compared with 5 years of tamoxifen, hence by about 40% (proportionately) compared with no endocrine treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: Since the introduction of breast-conserving treatment, various radiation doses after lumpectomy have been used. In a phase 3 randomised controlled trial, we investigated the effect of a radiation boost of 16 Gy on overall survival, local control, and fibrosis for patients with stage I and II breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving treatment compared with patients who received no boost. Here, we present the 20-year follow-up results. Methods: Patients with microscopically complete excision for invasive disease followed by whole-breast irradiation of 50 Gy in 5 weeks were centrally randomised (1:1) with a minimisation algorithm to receive 16 Gy boost or no boost, with minimisation for age, menopausal status, presence of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, clinical tumour size, nodal status, and institution. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between May 24, 1989, and June 25, 1996, 2657 patients were randomly assigned to receive no radiation boost and 2661 patients randomly assigned to receive a radiation boost. Median follow-up was 17.2 years (IQR 13.0-19.0). 20-year overall survival was 59.7% (99% CI 56.3-63.0) in the boost group versus 61.1% (57.6-64.3) in the no boost group, hazard ratio (HR) 1.05 (99% CI 0.92-1.19, p=0.323). Ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was the first treatment failure for 354 patients (13%) in the no boost group versus 237 patients (9%) in the boost group, HR 0.65 (99% CI 0.52-0.81, p<0.0001). The 20-year cumulative incidence of ipsilatelal breast tumour recurrence was 16.4% (99% CI 14.1-18.8) in the no boost group versus 12.0% (9.8-14.4) in the boost group. Mastectomies as first salvage treatment for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence occurred in 279 (79%) of 354 patients in the no boost group versus 178 (75%) of 237 in the boost group. The cumulative incidence of severe fibrosis at 20 years was 1.8% (99% CI 1.1-2.5) in the no boost group versus 5.2% (99% CI 3.9-6.4) in the boost group (p<0.0001). Conclusion: A radiation boost after whole-breast irradiation has no effect on long-term overall survival, but can improve local control, with the largest absolute benefit in young patients, although it increases the risk of moderate to severe fibrosis. The extra radiation dose can be avoided in most patients older than age 60 years.",

        "abstract": "Background: Worldwide data for cancer survival are scarce. We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control. Methods: Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25·7 million adults (age 15-99 years) and 75,000 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995-2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Results: 5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005-09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15-19% in North America, and as low as 7-9% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10-20% between 1995-99 and 2005-09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50% to more than 70%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995-99 and 2005-09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005-09, 5-year survival was 40% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005-09 was high (54-58%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18-23%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60% in several countries, but as high as 90% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease. Conclusion: International comparison of survival trends reveals very wide differences that are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimum treatment. Continuous worldwide surveillance of cancer survival should become an indispensable source of information for cancer patients and researchers and a stimulus for politicians to improve health policy and health-care systems.",

        "abstract": "Background: If treatment of the axilla is indicated in patients with breast cancer who have a positive sentinel node, axillary lymph node dissection is the present standard. Although axillary lymph node dissection provides excellent regional control, it is associated with harmful side-effects. We aimed to assess whether axillary radiotherapy provides comparable regional control with fewer side-effects. Methods: Patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy were enrolled in the randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 non-inferiority EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive either axillary lymph node dissection or axillary radiotherapy in case of a positive sentinel node, stratified by institution. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of 5-year axillary recurrence, considered to be not more than 4% for the axillary radiotherapy group compared with an expected 2% in the axillary lymph node dissection group. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol. The AMAROS trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between Feb 19, 2001, and April 29, 2010, 4823 patients were enrolled at 34 centres from nine European countries, of whom 4806 were eligible for randomisation. 2402 patients were randomly assigned to receive axillary lymph node dissection and 2404 to receive axillary radiotherapy. Of the 1425 patients with a positive sentinel node, 744 had been randomly assigned to axillary lymph node dissection and 681 to axillary radiotherapy; these patients constituted the intention-to-treat population. Median follow-up was 6·1 years (IQR 4·1-8·0) for the patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes. In the axillary lymph node dissection group, 220 (33%) of 672 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection had additional positive nodes. Axillary recurrence occurred in four of 744 patients in the axillary lymph node dissection group and seven of 681 in the axillary radiotherapy group. 5-year axillary recurrence was 0·43% (95% CI 0·00-0·92) after axillary lymph node dissection versus 1·19% (0·31-2·08) after axillary radiotherapy. The planned non-inferiority test was underpowered because of the low number of events. The one-sided 95% CI for the underpowered non-inferiority test on the hazard ratio was 0·00-5·27, with a non-inferiority margin of 2. Lymphoedema in the ipsilateral arm was noted significantly more often after axillary lymph node dissection than after axillary radiotherapy at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. Conclusion: Axillary lymph node dissection and axillary radiotherapy after a positive sentinel node provide excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy. Axillary radiotherapy results in significantly less morbidity.",

        "abstract": "Background: Postmastectomy radiotherapy was shown in previous meta-analyses to reduce the risks of both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in all women with node-positive disease considered together. However, the benefit in women with only one to three positive lymph nodes is uncertain. We aimed to assess the effect of radiotherapy in these women after mastectomy and axillary dissection. Methods: We did a meta-analysis of individual data for 8135 women randomly assigned to treatment groups during 1964-86 in 22 trials of radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes after mastectomy and axillary surgery versus the same surgery but no radiotherapy. Follow-up lasted 10 years for recurrence and to Jan 1, 2009, for mortality. Analyses were stratified by trial, individual follow-up year, age at entry, and pathological nodal status. Results: 3786 women had axillary dissection to at least level II and had zero, one to three, or four or more positive nodes. All were in trials in which radiotherapy included the chest wall, supraclavicular or axillary fossa (or both), and internal mammary chain. For 700 women with axillary dissection and no positive nodes, radiotherapy had no significant effect on locoregional recurrence (two-sided significance level [2p]>0·1), overall recurrence (rate ratio [RR], irradiated vs not, 1·06, 95% CI 0·76-1·48, 2p>0·1), or breast cancer mortality (RR 1·18, 95% CI 0·89-1·55, 2p>0·1). For 1314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·57-0·82, 2p=0·00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·67-0·95, 2p=0·01). 1133 of these 1314 women were in trials in which systemic therapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, or tamoxifen) was given in both trial groups and, for them, radiotherapy again reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·55-0·82, 2p=0·00009), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·78, 95% CI 0·64-0·94, 2p=0·01). For 1772 women with axillary dissection and four or more positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p<0·00001), overall recurrence (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·69-0·90, 2p=0·0003), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·77-0·99, 2p=0·04). Conclusion: After mastectomy and axillary dissection, radiotherapy reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the women with one to three positive lymph nodes in these trials even when systemic therapy was given. For today's women, who in many countries are at lower risk of recurrence, absolute gains might be smaller but proportional gains might be larger because of more effective radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pathological complete response has been proposed as a surrogate endpoint for prediction of long-term clinical benefit, such as disease-free survival, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). We had four key objectives: to establish the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS, to establish the definition of pathological complete response that correlates best with long-term outcome, to identify the breast cancer subtypes in which pathological complete response is best correlated with long-term outcome, and to assess whether an increase in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups predicts improved EFS and OS. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline for clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. To be eligible, studies had to meet three inclusion criteria: include at least 200 patients with primary breast cancer treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery; have available data for pathological complete response, EFS, and OS; and have a median follow-up of at least 3 years. We compared the three most commonly used definitions of pathological complete response--ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, and ypT0/is--for their association with EFS and OS in a responder analysis. We assessed the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS in various subgroups. Finally, we did a trial-level analysis to assess whether pathological complete response could be used as a surrogate endpoint for EFS or OS. Results: We obtained data from 12 identified international trials and 11 955 patients were included in our responder analysis. Eradication of tumour from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0) was better associated with improved EFS (ypT0 ypN0: hazard ratio [HR] 0·44, 95% CI 0·39-0·51; ypT0/is ypN0: 0·48, 0·43-0·54) and OS (0·36, 0·30-0·44; 0·36, 0·31-0·42) than was tumour eradication from the breast alone (ypT0/is; EFS: HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·55-0·66; OS 0·51, 0·45-0·58). We used the ypT0/is ypN0 definition for all subsequent analyses. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcomes was strongest in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (EFS: HR 0·24, 95% CI 0·18-0·33; OS: 0·16, 0·11-0·25) and in those with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative tumours who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0·15, 0·09-0·27; OS: 0·08, 0·03, 0·22). In the trial-level analysis, we recorded little association between increases in frequency of pathological complete response and EFS (R(2)=0·03, 95% CI 0·00-0·25) and OS (R(2)=0·24, 0·00-0·70). Conclusion: Patients who attain pathological complete response defined as ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0 have improved survival. The prognostic value is greatest in aggressive tumour subtypes. Our pooled analysis could not validate pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS.",

The application of SLN surgery for staging the axilla following chemotherapy for women who initially had node-positive cN1 breast cancer is unclear because of high false-negative results reported in previous studies. Methods: To determine the false-negative rate (FNR) for SLN surgery following chemotherapy in women initially presenting with biopsy-proven cN1 breast cancer. Results: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1071 trial enrolled women from 136 institutions from July 2009 to June 2011 who had clinical T0 through T4, N1 through N2, M0 breast cancer and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following chemotherapy, patients underwent both SLN surgery and ALND. Sentinel lymph node surgery using both blue dye (isosulfan blue or methylene blue) and a radiolabeled colloid mapping agent was encouraged. Conclusion: The primary end point was the FNR of SLN surgery after chemotherapy in women who presented with cN1 disease. We evaluated the likelihood that the FNR in patients with 2 or more SLNs examined was greater than 10%, the rate expected for women undergoing SLN surgery who present with cN0 disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene. The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown. We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial. Methods: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events. The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·85-1·14, p=0·86). Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20·4%] vs 275 [16·3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7·2%] vs 69 [4·1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively). HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0·76 (95% CI 0·67-0·86, p<0·0001) for disease-free survival and 0·76 (0·65-0·88, p=0·0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy. Conclusion: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. 1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.",

        "abstract": "Background: The optimum timing of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain. The SENTINA (SENTinel NeoAdjuvant) study was designed to evaluate a specific algorithm for timing of a standardised sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure in patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: SENTINA is a four-arm, prospective, multicentre cohort study undertaken at 103 institutions in Germany and Austria. Women with breast cancer who were scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled into the study. Patients with clinically node-negative disease (cN0) underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm A). If the sentinel node was positive (pN1), a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure was done after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B). Women with clinically node-positive disease (cN+) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those who converted to clinically node-negative disease after chemotherapy (ycN0; arm C) were treated with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and axillary dissection. Only patients whose clinical nodal status remained positive (ycN1) underwent axillary dissection without sentinel-lymph-node biopsy (arm D). The primary endpoint was accuracy (false-negative rate) of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients who converted from cN1 to ycN0 disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm C). Secondary endpoints included comparison of the detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and also the false-negative rate and detection rate of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy after removal of the sentinel lymph node. Analyses were done according to treatment received (per protocol). Results: Of 1737 patients who received treatment, 1022 women underwent sentinel-lymph-node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arms A and B), with a detection rate of 99.1% (95% CI 98.3-99.6; 1013 of 1022). In patients who converted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from cN+ to ycN0 (arm C), the detection rate was 80.1% (95% CI 76.6-83.2; 474 of 592) and false-negative rate was 14.2% (95% CI 9.9-19.4; 32 of 226). The false-negative rate was 24.3% (17 of 70) for women who had one node removed and 18.5% (10 of 54) for those who had two sentinel nodes removed (arm C). In patients who had a second sentinel-lymph-node biopsy procedure after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (arm B), the detection rate was 60.8% (95% CI 55.6-65.9; 219 of 360) and the false-negative rate was 51.6% (95% CI 38.7-64.2; 33 of 64). Conclusion: Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is a reliable diagnostic method before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After systemic treatment or early sentinel-lymph-node biopsy, the procedure has a lower detection rate and a higher false-negative rate compared with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy done before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These limitations should be considered if biopsy is planned after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: For patients with breast cancer and metastases in the sentinel nodes, axillary dissection has been standard treatment. However, for patients with limited sentinel-node involvement, axillary dissection might be overtreatment. We designed IBCSG trial 23-01 to determine whether no axillary dissection was non-inferior to axillary dissection in patients with one or more micrometastatic (≤2 mm) sentinel nodes and tumour of maximum 5 cm. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial, patients were eligible if they had clinically non-palpable axillary lymph node(s) and a primary tumour of 5 cm or less and who, after sentinel-node biopsy, had one or more micrometastatic (≤2 mm) sentinel lymph nodes with no extracapsular extension. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to either undergo axillary dissection or not to undergo axillary dissection. Randomisation was stratified by centre and menopausal status. Treatment assignment was not masked. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Non-inferiority was defined as a hazard ratio (HR) of less than 1·25 for no axillary dissection versus axillary dissection. The analysis was by intention to treat. Per protocol, disease and survival information continues to be collected yearly. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between April 1, 2001, and Feb 28, 2010, 465 patients were randomly assigned to axillary dissection and 469 to no axillary dissection. After the exclusion of three patients, 464 patients were in the axillary dissection group and 467 patients were in the no axillary dissection group. After a median follow-up of 5·0 (IQR 3·6-7·3) years, we recorded 69 disease-free survival events in the axillary dissection group and 55 events in the no axillary dissection group. Breast-cancer-related events were recorded in 48 patients in the axillary dissection group and 47 in the no axillary dissection group (ten local recurrences in the axillary dissection group and eight in the no axillary dissection group; three and nine contralateral breast cancers; one and five [corrected] regional recurrences; and 34 and 25 distant relapses). Other non-breast cancer events were recorded in 21 patients in the axillary dissection group and eight in the no axillary dissection group (20 and six second non-breast malignancies; and one and two deaths not due to a cancer event). 5-year disease-free survival was 87·8% (95% CI 84·4-91·2) in the group without axillary dissection and 84·4% (80·7-88·1) in the group with axillary dissection (log-rank p=0·16; HR for no axillary dissection vs axillary dissection was 0·78, 95% CI 0·55-1·11, non-inferiority p=0·0042). Patients with reported long-term surgical events (grade 3-4) included one sensory neuropathy (grade 3), three lymphoedema (two grade 3 and one grade 4), and three motor neuropathy (grade 3), all in the group that underwent axillary dissection, and one grade 3 motor neuropathy in the group without axillary dissection. One serious adverse event was reported, a postoperative infection in the axilla in the group with axillary dissection. Conclusion: Axillary dissection could be avoided in patients with early breast cancer and limited sentinel-node involvement, thus eliminating complications of axillary surgery with no adverse effect on survival.",

Methods: Patients with ACC and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) reported to the National Cancer Data Base from 1998 to 2008 were reviewed for patient age, ethnicity, tumor size, nodal status, American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM Stage, tumor grade, initial treatment, hormone receptor status (for patients from 2004 to 2008), and survival (for patients from 1998 to 2003). Results: A total of 933 patients with ACC and 729,938 with IDC were identified. No differences were found for incidence by race/ethnicity (p = 0.97). The group with ACC was older (median 60 vs. 58 years), had larger tumors (median 18 vs. 16 mm), had more grade 1 tumors (46 vs. 18 %), was less likely to undergo axillary lymph node evaluation (75.9 vs. 96.3 %), had fewer node-positive patients (5.1 vs. 35.5 %), had fewer estrogen receptor-positive tumors (15.4 vs. 75.6 %), had fewer progesterone receptor-positive tumors (13.3 vs. 65.2 %), and underwent breast-conserving surgery more often (69.8 vs. 59.8 %). Chemotherapy was provided less often for ACC (11.3 vs. 46.4 %), as was hormone therapy (9.1 vs. 42.3 %). All of these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). With a median follow-up of 65.7 months (ACC) and 64.9 months (IDC), 5-year overall survival (OS) was 88 % for ACC vs. 84 % for IDC (p = 0.02). Grade 1 OS (ACC, 91 % vs. IDC, 92 %; p = 0.50) and stage I OS (ACC, 90 % vs. IDC, 91 %; p = 0.93) were equal. Conclusion: Compared with IDC, ACC has different characteristics (lower grade, hormone receptor negative, node negative), is treated differently (less axillary surgery, fewer mastectomies, less chemotherapy, less hormone therapy), and has an improved prognosis, with 88 % 5-year survival.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cardiac dysfunction (CD) is a recognized risk associated with the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer, especially when the treatment regimen includes anthracyclines. Given the demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab, ongoing assessment of cardiac safety and identification of risk factors for CD are important for optimal patient care. Methods: In National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31, a phase III adjuvant trial, 1,830 patients who met eligibility criteria for initiation of trastuzumab were evaluated for CD. Recovery from CD was also assessed. A statistical model was developed to estimate the risk of severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Baseline patient characteristics associated with anthracycline-related decline in cardiac function were also identified. Results: At 7-year follow-up, 37 (4.0%) of 944 patients who received trastuzumab experienced a cardiac event (CE) versus 10 (1.3%) of 743 patients in the control arm. One cardiac-related death has occurred in each arm of the protocol. A Cardiac Risk Score, calculated using patient age and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by multiple-gated acquisition scan, statistically correlates with the risk of a CE. After stopping trastuzumab, the majority of patients who experienced CD recovered LVEF in the normal range, although some decline from baseline often persists. Only two CEs occurred more than 2 years after initiation of trastuzumab. Conclusion: The late development of CHF after the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide chemotherapy is uncommon. The risk versus benefit of trastuzumab as given in this regimen remains strongly in favor of trastuzumab.",

        "abstract": "Background: Moderate differences in efficacy between adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer are plausible, and could affect treatment choices. We sought any such differences. Methods: We undertook individual-patient-data meta-analyses of the randomised trials comparing: any taxane-plus-anthracycline-based regimen versus the same, or more, non-taxane chemotherapy (n=44,000); one anthracycline-based regimen versus another (n=7000) or versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; n=18,000); and polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (n=32,000). The scheduled dosages of these three drugs and of the anthracyclines doxorubicin (A) and epirubicin (E) were used to define standard CMF, standard 4AC, and CAF and CEF. Log-rank breast cancer mortality rate ratios (RRs) are reported. Results: In trials adding four separate cycles of a taxane to a fixed anthracycline-based control regimen, extending treatment duration, breast cancer mortality was reduced (RR 0·86, SE 0·04, two-sided significance [2p]=0·0005). In trials with four such extra cycles of a taxane counterbalanced in controls by extra cycles of other cytotoxic drugs, roughly doubling non-taxane dosage, there was no significant difference (RR 0·94, SE 0·06, 2p=0·33). Trials with CMF-treated controls showed that standard 4AC and standard CMF were equivalent (RR 0·98, SE 0·05, 2p=0·67), but that anthracycline-based regimens with substantially higher cumulative dosage than standard 4AC (eg, CAF or CEF) were superior to standard CMF (RR 0·78, SE 0·06, 2p=0·0004). Trials versus no chemotherapy also suggested greater mortality reductions with CAF (RR 0·64, SE 0·09, 2p<0·0001) than with standard 4AC (RR 0·78, SE 0·09, 2p=0·01) or standard CMF (RR 0·76, SE 0·05, 2p<0·0001). In all meta-analyses involving taxane-based or anthracycline-based regimens, proportional risk reductions were little affected by age, nodal status, tumour diameter or differentiation (moderate or poor; few were well differentiated), oestrogen receptor status, or tamoxifen use. Hence, largely independently of age (up to at least 70 years) or the tumour characteristics currently available to us for the patients selected to be in these trials, some taxane-plus-anthracycline-based or higher-cumulative-dosage anthracycline-based regimens (not requiring stem cells) reduced breast cancer mortality by, on average, about one-third. 10-year overall mortality differences paralleled breast cancer mortality differences, despite taxane, anthracycline, and other toxicities. Conclusion: 10-year gains from a one-third breast cancer mortality reduction depend on absolute risks without chemotherapy (which, for oestrogen-receptor-positive disease, are the risks remaining with appropriate endocrine therapy). Low absolute risk implies low absolute benefit, but information was lacking about tumour gene expression markers or quantitative immunohistochemistry that might help to predict risk, chemosensitivity, or both.",

Methods: We undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data for 10,801 women in 17 randomised trials of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, 8337 of whom had pathologically confirmed node-negative (pN0) or node-positive (pN+) disease. Results: Overall, radiotherapy reduced the 10-year risk of any (ie, locoregional or distant) first recurrence from 35·0% to 19·3% (absolute reduction 15·7%, 95% CI 13·7-17·7, 2p<0·00001) and reduced the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 25·2% to 21·4% (absolute reduction 3·8%, 1·6-6·0, 2p=0·00005). In women with pN0 disease (n=7287), radiotherapy reduced these risks from 31·0% to 15·6% (absolute recurrence reduction 15·4%, 13·2-17·6, 2p<0·00001) and from 20·5% to 17·2% (absolute mortality reduction 3·3%, 0·8-5·8, 2p=0·005), respectively. In these women with pN0 disease, the absolute recurrence reduction varied according to age, grade, oestrogen-receptor status, tamoxifen use, and extent of surgery, and these characteristics were used to predict large (≥20%), intermediate (10-19%), or lower (<10%) absolute reductions in the 10-year recurrence risk. Absolute reductions in 15-year risk of breast cancer death in these three prediction categories were 7·8% (95% CI 3·1-12·5), 1·1% (-2·0 to 4·2), and 0·1% (-7·5 to 7·7) respectively (trend in absolute mortality reduction 2p=0·03). In the few women with pN+ disease (n=1050), radiotherapy reduced the 10-year recurrence risk from 63·7% to 42·5% (absolute reduction 21·2%, 95% CI 14·5-27·9, 2p<0·00001) and the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 51·3% to 42·8% (absolute reduction 8·5%, 1·8-15·2, 2p=0·01). Overall, about one breast cancer death was avoided by year 15 for every four recurrences avoided by year 10, and the mortality reduction did not differ significantly from this overall relationship in any of the three prediction categories for pN0 disease or for pN+ disease. Conclusion: After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy to the conserved breast halves the rate at which the disease recurs and reduces the breast cancer death rate by about a sixth. These proportional benefits vary little between different groups of women. By contrast, the absolute benefits from radiotherapy vary substantially according to the characteristics of the patient and they can be predicted at the time when treatment decisions need to be made.",

        "abstract": "Background: We previously described a novel breast cancer staging system for assessing prognosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of pretreatment clinical stage (CS), estrogen receptor status (E), grade (G), and post-treatment pathologic stage (PS). This clinical-pathologic stage (CPS) + EG staging system assigned and summed points for each factor, allowing for better determination of breast cancer-specific survival than CS or PS alone. The current study was undertaken to validate this staging system using internal and external cohorts. Methods: We identified an internal cohort of 804 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our institution from 2003 to 2005 and an external cohort of 165 patients treated at another institution. Clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment regimens, and patient outcomes were assessed. Outcomes were stratified by CPS + EG score. Results: Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) for the internal cohort was 77% (95% CI, 72 to 82) at a median follow-up of 3.4 years (range, 0.3 to 5.9 years). Five-year DSS for the external cohort was 86% (95% CI, 79 to 91) at a median follow-up of 4.7 years (range, 0.5 to 10.5 years). The ability of the CPS + EG score to stratify outcomes was confirmed in both the internal and external cohorts. Application of the CPS + EG staging system facilitated more refined categorization of patients into prognostic subgroups by outcome than presenting CS or final PS as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Conclusion: The current study validates the CPS + EG staging system in two independent cohorts. We recommend that biologic markers and response to treatment be incorporated into revised versions of the AJCC staging system for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Sentinel-lymph-node (SLN) surgery was designed to minimise the side-effects of lymph-node surgery but still offer outcomes equivalent to axillary-lymph-node dissection (ALND). The aims of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial B-32 were to establish whether SLN resection in patients with breast cancer achieves the same survival and regional control as ALND, but with fewer side-effects. Methods: NSABP B-32 was a randomised controlled phase 3 trial done at 80 centres in Canada and the USA between May 1, 1999, and Feb 29, 2004. Women with invasive breast cancer were randomly assigned to either SLN resection plus ALND (group 1) or to SLN resection alone with ALND only if the SLNs were positive (group 2). Random assignment was done at the NSABP Biostatistical Center (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with a biased coin minimisation approach in an allocation ratio of 1:1. Stratification variables were age at entry (≤ 49 years, ≥ 50 years), clinical tumour size (≤ 2·0 cm, 2·1-4·0 cm, ≥ 4·1 cm), and surgical plan (lumpectomy, mastectomy). SLN resection was done with a blue dye and radioactive tracer. Outcome analyses were done in patients who were assessed as having pathologically negative sentinel nodes and for whom follow-up data were available. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. All deaths, irrespective of cause, were included. The mean time on study for the SLN-negative patients with follow-up information was 95·6 months (range 70·1-126·7). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: 5611 women were randomly assigned to the treatment groups, 3989 had pathologically negative SLN. 309 deaths were reported in the 3986 SLN-negative patients with follow-up information: 140 of 1975 patients in group 1 and 169 of 2011 in group 2. Log-rank comparison of overall survival in groups 1 and 2 yielded an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1·20 (95% CI 0·96-1·50; p=0·12). 8-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall survival were 91·8% (95% CI 90·4-93·3) in group 1 and 90·3% (88·8-91·8) in group 2. Treatment comparisons for disease-free survival yielded an unadjusted HR of 1·05 (95% CI 0·90-1·22; p=0·54). 8-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for disease-free survival were 82·4% (80·5-84·4) in group 1 and 81·5% (79·6-83·4) in group 2. There were eight regional-node recurrences as first events in group 1 and 14 in group 2 (p=0·22). Patients are continuing follow-up for longer-term assessment of survival and regional control. The most common adverse events were allergic reactions, mostly related to the administration of the blue dye. Conclusion: Overall survival, disease-free survival, and regional control were statistically equivalent between groups. When the SLN is negative, SLN surgery alone with no further ALND is an appropriate, safe, and effective therapy for breast cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes.",

Joinpoint analysis was used to identify the year when trends in all age mortality began to change. Conclusion: From 1989 to 2006, there was a median reduction in breast cancer mortality of 19%, ranging from a 45% reduction in Iceland to a 17% increase in Romania. Breast cancer mortality decreased by >or=20% in 15 countries, and the reduction tended to be greater in countries with higher mortality in 1987-9. England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland had the second, third, and fourth largest decreases of 35%, 29%, and 30%, respectively. In France, Finland, and Sweden, mortality decreased by 11%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. In central European countries mortality did not decline or even increased during the period. Downward mortality trends usually started between 1988 and 1996, and the persistent reduction from 1999 to 2006 indicates that these trends may continue. The median changes in the age groups were -37% (range -76% to -14%) in women aged <50, -21% (-40% to 14%) in 50-69 year olds, and -2% (-42% to 80%) in >or=70 year olds.",

Methods: We performed a systematic review to resolve these questions, using standard Cochrane methodology to identify, select and appraise relevant randomised trials. Results: Four randomised controlled trials involving 3925 women were identified. All were high quality with minimal risk of bias. Analysis confirmed a statistically significant benefit from the addition of radiotherapy on all ipsilateral breast events (HR=0.49; 95% CI 0.41-0.58, p<0.00001). All subgroups analysed (margin status, age and grade) benefited from the addition of radiotherapy. Nine women require treatment with radiotherapy to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence (NNT=9). Deaths due to vascular disease, pulmonary toxicity and second cancers were low and not significantly higher for women who received radiotherapy. Conclusion: Radiotherapy was beneficial in all clinically relevant subgroups. Longer follow-up is required to detect any long-term toxicity from use of radiotherapy. To date, no increase in toxicity has been identified.",

Methods: Collaborative meta-analyses of individual patient data for about 6000 women with ER-poor breast cancer in 46 trials of polychemotherapy versus not (non-taxane-based polychemotherapy, typically about six cycles; trial start dates 1975-96, median 1984) and about 14 000 women with ER-poor breast cancer in 50 trials of tamoxifen versus not (some trials in the presence and some in the absence of polychemotherapy; trial start dates 1972-93, median 1982). Results: In women with ER-poor breast cancer, polychemotherapy significantly reduced recurrence, breast cancer mortality, and death from any cause, in those younger than 50 years and those aged 50-69 years at entry into trials of polychemotherapy versus not. In those aged younger than 50 years (1907 women, 15% node-positive), the 10-year risks were: recurrence 33% versus 45% (ratio of 10-year risks 0.73, 2p<0.00001), breast cancer mortality 24% versus 32% (ratio 0.73, 2p=0.0002), and death from any cause 25% versus 33% (ratio 0.75, 2p=0.0003). In women aged 50-69 years (3965 women, 58% node-positive), the 10-year risks were: recurrence 42% versus 52% (ratio 0.82, 2p<0.00001), breast cancer mortality 36% versus 42% (ratio 0.86, 2p=0.0004), and death from any cause 39% versus 45% (ratio 0.87, 2p=0.0009). Few were aged 70 years or older. Tamoxifen had little effect on recurrence or death in women who were classified in these trials as having ER-poor disease, and did not significantly modify the effects of polychemotherapy. Conclusion: In women who had ER-poor breast cancer, and were either younger than 50 years or between 50 and 69 years, these older adjuvant polychemotherapy regimens were safe (ie, had little effect on mortality from causes other than breast cancer) and produced substantial and definite reductions in the 10-year risks of recurrence and death. Current and future chemotherapy regimens could well yield larger proportional reductions in breast cancer mortality.",

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 2,594 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I and II breast cancer between 1989 and 1998 at the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared among patients grouped by time from definitive curative surgery to start of adjuvant chemotherapy (< or = 4 weeks, > 4 to 8 weeks, > 8 to 12 weeks, and >12 to 24 weeks). Results: RFS and OS were similar for women starting chemotherapy up to 12 weeks after surgery. OS hazard ratio (univariate) for initiation of chemotherapy more than 12 weeks compared with 12 weeks or less after surgery was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.10; P = .017). Five-year OS rates were 84%, 85%, 89%, and 78%, (log-rank P = .013); RFS rates were 74%, 79%, 82%, and 69% (log-rank P = .004) for patients starting chemotherapy 4 weeks or fewer, more than 4 to 8 weeks, more than 8 to 12 weeks, and more than 12 to 24 weeks after surgery, respectively. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were grade, size, nodal status, estrogen receptor, age, and lymphatic and/or vascular invasion. Initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy more than 12 weeks from surgery remained significantly associated with inferior survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.3; P = .005). Conclusion: This retrospective analysis suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy is equally effective up to 12 weeks after definitive surgery but that RFS and OS appear to be compromised by delays of more than 12 weeks after definitive surgery.",

        "abstract": "Background: We reviewed follow-up of patients treated in 19 randomized trials of adjuvant epirubicin in early breast cancer to determine incidence, risk, and risk factors for subsequent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Methods: The patients (N = 9,796) were observed from the start of adjuvant treatment (53,080 patient-years). Cases of AML or MDS (AML/MDS) were reported, with disease characteristics. Incidence and cumulative risk were compared for possible risk factors, for assigned regimens, and for administered cumulative doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Results: In 7,110 patients treated with epirubicin-containing regimens (92% of whom also received cyclophosphamide), 8-year cumulative probability of AML/MDS was 0.55% (95% CI, 0.33% to 0.78%). The risk of developing AML/MDS increased in relation to planned epirubicin dose per cycle, planned epirubicin dose-intensity, and administered cumulative doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Patients with administered cumulative doses of both epirubicin and cyclophosphamide not exceeding those used in standard regimens (</= 720 mg/m(2) and </= 6,300 mg/m(2), respectively) had an 8-year cumulative probability of developing AML/MDS of 0.37% (95% CI, 0.13% to 0.61%) compared with 4.97% (95% CI, 2.06% to 7.87%) for patients administered higher cumulative doses of both epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Conclusion: Patients treated with standard cumulative doses of adjuvant epirubicin (</= 720 mg/m(2)) and cyclophosphamide (</= 6,300 mg/m(2)) for early breast cancer have a lower probability of secondary leukemia than patients treated with higher cumulative doses. Increased risk of secondary leukemia must be considered when assessing the potential benefit to risk ratio of higher than standard doses.",

        "abstract": "Background: Quinquennial overviews (1985-2000) of the randomised trials in early breast cancer have assessed the 5 year and 10-year effects of various systemic adjuvant therapies on breast cancer recurrence and survival. Here, we report the 10-year and 15-year effects. Methods: Collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modern aromatase inhibitors. Results: Allocation to about 6 months of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC) reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38% (SE 5) for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by about 20% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed, largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0.0001 for recurrence, 2p<0.00001 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than CMF chemotherapy. Few women of age 70 years or older entered these chemotherapy trials. For ER-positive disease only, allocation to about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31% (SE 3), largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50, 50-69, > or =70 years), progesterone receptor status, or other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly (2p<0.00001 for recurrence, 2p=0.01 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses: anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women); CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14,000); anthracycline-based versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14,000); about 5 years of tamoxifen versus none (15,000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen versus none (33,000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of tamoxifen (18,000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of 38% (age <50 years) and 20% (age 50-69 years) from such chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31% from tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality reductions would be 57% and 45%, respectively (and, the trial results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival would be comparably improved, since these treatments have relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all other causes. Conclusion: Some of the widely practicable adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s, which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further improvements in long-term survival could well be available from newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.",

Cohort 1 enrolled patients with ≥4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), or 1-3 positive ALNs and either grade 3 disease or tumor ≥5 cm. Cohort 2 enrolled patients with 1-3 positive ALNs and centrally determined high Ki-67 index (≥20%). The primary endpoint was IDFS in the intent-to-treat population (cohorts 1 and 2). Secondary endpoints were IDFS in patients with high Ki-67, DRFS, overall survival, and safety. Results: At the primary outcome analysis, with 19 months median follow-up time, abemaciclib + ET resulted in a 29% reduction in the risk of developing an IDFS event [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.87; nominal P = 0.0009]. At the additional follow-up analysis, with 27 months median follow-up and 90% of patients off treatment, IDFS (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82; nominal P < 0.0001) and DRFS (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83; nominal P < 0.0001) benefit was maintained. The absolute improvements in 3-year IDFS and DRFS rates were 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Whereas Ki-67 index was prognostic, abemaciclib benefit was consistent regardless of Ki-67 index. Safety data were consistent with the known abemaciclib risk profile. Conclusion: Abemaciclib + ET significantly improved IDFS in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer, with an acceptable safety profile. Ki-67 index was prognostic, but abemaciclib benefit was observed regardless of Ki-67 index. Overall, the robust treatment benefit of abemaciclib extended beyond the 2-year treatment period.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patient-centered digital interventions may help empower young women to self-manage symptoms and psychosocial concerns and support informational needs often unaddressed in clinic. Methods: Young, Empowered and Strong (YES) is an interactive web-based intervention designed to engage young women with personalized education and symptom self-management resources on the basis of responses to patient-reported outcome-based questionnaires. We piloted YES among young women (< 45 years) with newly diagnosed early breast cancer (EBC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and breast cancer survivors (BCSs). Assessments were deployed weekly (EBC and MBC) or every 4 weeks (BCSs) over 12 weeks. At study completion, use, feasibility, and acceptability of YES were evaluated via a survey and semistructured interview. Results: Thirty women were enrolled between April and June 2019: 10 EBC, 10 BCSs, and 10 MBC. The mean age at diagnosis and enrollment was 36 (range 25-44) and 39 (range 31-44) years, respectively. Most participants were actively treated (96%, 27 of 28) with endocrine therapy (54%, 15 of 28) or chemotherapy (43%, 12 of 28). Overall, 61% (180 of 296) of assessments were completed (EBC: 70%, BCSs: 63%, and MBC: 52%). Of 37 patient-reported outcome and need domains, the most frequently triggered were sexual health (EBC: 90%, BCSs: 90%, and MBC: 90%), anxiety (EBC: 80%, BCSs: 90%, and MBC: 90%), stress and mindfulness (EBC: 80%, BCSs: 90%, and MBC: 90%), and fatigue (EBC: 90%, BCSs: 80%, and MBC: 90%). On postpilot survey, participants reported that YES helped them to learn (50%, 7 of 14), monitor (43%, 6 of 14), and manage (57%, 8 of 14) their symptoms. Conclusion: YES is a feasible and acceptable digital intervention to support young women across the breast cancer care continuum. The nearly universal triggering of sexual and mental health needs suggests suboptimal management in the clinical setting and the potential for self-management through a digital platform.",

        "abstract": "Background: Trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality. Methods: We did a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials assessing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus the same chemotherapy alone. Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs). Results: Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p<0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p<0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p<0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p<0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p<0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, -0·3 to 1·1; p=0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0-1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2-4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5-9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1-3, and N4+ disease). Conclusion: Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional reductions irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and residual invasive disease (RD) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have a high-risk for recurrence, which is reduced by adjuvant capecitabine. Preclinical models support the use of platinum agents in the TNBC basal subtype. The EA1131 trial hypothesized that invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) would not be inferior but improved in patients with basal subtype TNBC treated with adjuvant platinum compared with capecitabine. Methods: Patients with clinical stage II or III TNBC with ≥ 1 cm RD in the breast post-NAC were randomly assigned to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles or capecitabine 14 out of 21 days every 3 weeks for six cycles. TNBC subtype (basal   nonbasal) was determined by PAM50 in the residual disease. A noninferiority design with superiority alternative was chosen, assuming a 4-year iDFS of 67% with capecitabine. Results: Four hundred ten of planned 775 participants were randomly assigned to platinum or capecitabine between 2015 and 2021. After median follow-up of 20 months and 120 iDFS events (61% of full information) in the 308 (78%) patients with basal subtype TNBC, the 3-year iDFS for platinum was 42% (95% CI, 30 to 53) versus 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) for capecitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were more common with platinum agents. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial as it was unlikely that further follow-up would show noninferiority or superiority of platinum. Conclusion: Platinum agents do not improve outcomes in patients with basal subtype TNBC RD post-NAC and are associated with more severe toxicity when compared with capecitabine. Participants had a lower than expected 3-year iDFS regardless of study treatment, highlighting the need for better therapies in this high-risk population.",

New therapies are needed to reduce recurrence in patients with   or   germline mutation-associated early breast cancer. Methods: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial involving patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer with   or   germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and high-risk clinicopathological factors who had received local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to 1 year of oral olaparib or placebo. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival. Results: A total of 1836 patients underwent randomization. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 85.9% in the olaparib group and 77.1% in the placebo group (difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 13.0; hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.82; P<0.001). The 3-year distant disease-free survival was 87.5% in the olaparib group and 80.4% in the placebo group (difference, 7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.0 to 11.1; hazard ratio for distant disease or death, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.39 to 0.83; P<0.001). Olaparib was associated with fewer deaths than placebo (59 and 86, respectively) (hazard ratio, 0.68; 99% CI, 0.44 to 1.05; P = 0.02); however, the between-group difference was not significant at an interim-analysis boundary of a P value of less than 0.01. Safety data were consistent with known side effects of olaparib, with no excess serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest. Conclusion: Among patients with high-risk, HER2-negative early breast cancer and germline   or   pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, adjuvant olaparib after completion of local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer survival free of invasive or distant disease than was placebo.

There are significant differences regarding clinical behaviour and genetic profiles between female (FBC) and male breast cancer (MBC). Parameters for decision-making on treatment and prognosis are derived from FBC. Ki67 has a high value as a prognostic and predictive factor in FBC, but accurate Ki67 cut-off points for MBC are missing. In this study, we aimed to evaluate adequate examination methods and reliable cut-off points for Ki67 to assess the highest prognostic value for patient's overall survival (OS). Methods: In this multicentric retrospective study, histological specimens were obtained from 104 male patients who were diagnosed and treated for primary invasive breast cancer. We applied three methods of Ki67 analysis: Tumor average scoring (TA), tumor border scoring (TB) and hot-spot scoring (HS). Calculated Ki67 cut-off points for each method were assessed as a threshold for patients' overall survival (OS). Results: Ki67 cut-off points were 13.5 for the TA group, 22.5 for the HS group and 17.5 for the TB group. Only Ki67 TA cut-off calculations demonstrated statistical significance (p = 0.04). Ki67 expression analysis of TA showed that more than 90% of patients with low Ki67 levels (< 13.5) were alive after 5-year follow-up. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that determination of Ki67 expression in TA is the most reliable to define a cut-off point with high prognostic value. A Ki67 cut-off point of 13.5 shows highest statistical power to define luminal A subgroup and OS.",

As recommendations for PMRT broaden, an increasing number of patients will have it included as part of their breast cancer treatment plan. Methods: This overview of the literature strives to broaden the exposure of the plastic surgeon to PMRT and describe the indications, guidelines, and considerations relevant to reconstructive surgery. The primary targets and dosing considerations will also be reviewed. Finally, the short- and long-term toxicities are outlined with the goal of providing the plastic surgeon insights with which to recognize certain toxicities in the clinic during follow up and to develop the fluency to be able to talk to patients about the potential for certain toxicities. Results: Generally, PMRT is safe and well tolerated. Considerations in breast reconstruction should be made on a patient-by-patient basis. Plastic surgeon familiarity with PMRT, its indications, and complications will amplify the surgeon's ability to optimize outcomes. Conclusion: As more women undergo breast reconstruction, an increasing number of patients will have PMRT as part of their breast cancer treatment plan. By understanding the basic principles of PMRT, plastic surgeons can engage patients in conversations of shared decision-making and maximize outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women. In contrast, male BC is about 100 times less common than in women, being considered a rare disease. Male BC may be a distinctive subtype of BC and available data seems to indicate that male BC has a higher dependence on genetic variants than female BC. Nevertheless, the same prognostic and predictive markers are used to determine optimal management strategies for both male and female BC. Several studies have assessed the role of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes in female BC susceptibility. However, data on male BC is scarce. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the role of SNPs in XRCC1, MUTYH and TP53 genes in a male cohort of BC, and, in addition, compare the male data with matched results previously genotyped in female BC patients. Methods: The male BC cohort was genotyped through Real-Time PCR using TaqMan Assays for several SNPs previously analysed in Portuguese female BC patients. Results: The results obtained indicate significant differences in BC susceptibility between males and females for the XRCC1 rs1799782, MUTYH rs3219489 and TP53 rs1042522 and rs8064946 variants. Conclusion: In males, XRCC1 and TP53 variants, when in heterozygosity, seem to be related with lower susceptibility for BC, contrasting with higher susceptibility for a MUTYH variant in females. These findings may help to explain the difference in incidence of BC between the two sexes.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly being used to treat early-stage triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor 2-overexpressing breast cancers, as well as locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers. The rationales for neoadjuvant therapy are to shrink tumor size and potentially decrease the extent of surgery, to serve as an in vivo test of response to therapy, and to reveal prognostic information for the patient. MRI is the most accurate modality to demonstrate response to therapy and to help ensure accurate presurgical planning. Changes in lesion diameter, volume, and enhancement are used to predict complete response, partial response, or nonresponse to therapy. However, residual disease may be overestimated or underestimated at MRI. Fibrosis, necrotic tumors, and residual benign masses may be causes of overestimation of residual disease. Nonmass lesions, invasive lobular carcinoma, hormone receptor-positive tumors, nonconcentric shrinkage patterns, the use of antiangiogenic therapy, and late-enhancing foci may be causes of underestimation of residual disease. In patients with known axillary lymph node metastasis, neoadjuvant therapy may be followed by targeted axillary dissection to avoid the potential morbidity associated with an axillary lymph node dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging, radiomics, machine learning, and deep learning methods are under investigation to improve MRI accuracy in predicting treatment response. RSNA, 2021.",

Without population-based mammography screening, rising rates cannot be attributed to screening. Investigations are needed to understand the potential drivers of this trend. Methods: An international team of experts convened to discuss the trends, environmental exposures, and clinical implications associated with BC in India and outlined recommendations for its management. Results: Panels were structured across three major BC themes (n = 10 presentations). The symposium concluded with a semi-structured Think Tank designed to elicit short-term and long-term goals that could address the challenges of BC in India. Conclusion: There was consensus that the prevalence of late-stage BC and the high BC mortality rates are associated with the practice of detection, which is primarily through clinical and self-breast exams, as opposed to mammography. Triple-Negative BC (TNBC) was extensively discussed, including TNBC etiology and potential risk factors, the limited treatment options, and if reported TNBC rates are supported by rigorous scientific evidence. The Think Tank session yielded long-term and short-term goals to further BC reduction in India and included more regional etiological studies on environmental exposures using existing India-based cohorts and case-control studies, standardization for molecular subtyping of BC cases, and improving the public's awareness of breast health.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women aged less than 40 years and the second most common cause of cancer death in this age group. Global rates of young onset breast cancer have risen steadily over the last twenty years. Although young women with breast cancer have a higher frequency of underlying pathogenic mutations in high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes (CSG) than older women, the vast majority of young breast cancer patients are not found to have a germline CSG mutation. There is therefore a need to inform young women regarding non-genetic breast cancer risk factors which have the potential to be influenced by changes in individual behaviour. A Pubmed search was performed using the search terms \"young\" or \"early onset\", and \"breast cancer\" and \"modifiable risk\". Titles and abstracts from peer-reviewed publications were screened for relevance. This review presents evidence for potentially modifiable risk factors of breast cancer risk in young women, including lifestyle factors (physical activity, body habitus, alcohol use, smoking, shift work and socioeconomic factors), reproductive and hormonal factors and iatrogenic risks. The extent to which these factors are truly modifiable is discussed and interactions between genetic and non-genetic risk factors are also addressed. Health care professionals have an opportunity to inform young women about breast health and risk when presenting at a \"teachable moment\", including the benefits of physical activity and alcohol habits as risk factor. More focussed discussions regarding individual personal risk and benefit should accompany conversations regarding reproductive health and take into consideration both non-modifiable and iatrogenic BC risk factors.",

Methods: PENELOPE-B ( ) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study in women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative primary breast cancer without a pathological complete response after taxane-containing NACT and at high risk of relapse (clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading score ≥ 3 or 2 and ypN+). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 13 cycles of palbociclib 125 mg once daily or placebo on days 1-21 in a 28-day cycle in addition to endocrine therapy (ET). Primary end point is invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). Final analysis was planned after 290 iDFS events with a two-sided efficacy boundary   < .0463 because of two interim analyses. Results: One thousand two hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned. The median age was 49.0 years (range, 19-79), and the majority were ypN+ with Ki-67 ≤ 15%; 59.4% of patients had a clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading score ≥ 3. 50.1% received aromatase inhibitor, and 33% of premenopausal women received a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog in addition to either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. After a median follow-up of 42.8 months (92% complete), 308 events were confirmed. Palbociclib did not improve iDFS versus placebo added to ET-stratified hazard ratio, 0.93 (95% repeated CI, 0.74 to 1.17) and two-sided weighted log-rank test (Cui, Hung, and Wang)   = .525. There was no difference among the subgroups. Most common related serious adverse events were infections and vascular disorders in 113 (9.1%) patients with no difference between the treatment arms. Eight fatal serious adverse events (two palbociclib and six placebo) were reported.

To improve patient access and pace of genetic testing, as well as refocus FCC resources, a mainstream clinical genetic testing program was rolled out in September 2017 through the Parkville FCC (PFCC) in Australia at 10 hospital sites. This program enables specialist doctors of eligible patients affected by breast cancer to arrange genetic testing directly at an oncology/surgical appointment and follow up the results as part of the patients' routine clinical care. In this model, the specialist doctor is responsible for any treatment implications of the genetic test result, and the PFCC is responsible for result interpretation, future cancer risk, family cascade testing and segregation testing where warranted. To date the program has had successful uptake, a notable pathogenic variant detection rate, reduced the burden on the PFCC enabling a reallocation of resources and has streamlined the process of genetic testing for eligible patients. Investigation into the patient and clinician experiences of the mainstream program is required.",

        "abstract": "Background: Low-dose tamoxifen halved recurrence after surgery in a phase III trial in breast noninvasive disease without increasing adverse events. We explored the effect of low-dose tamoxifen in clinically relevant subgroups, including menopausal status, estradiol levels, smoking, body mass index, and proliferation of baseline lesion. Methods: Incidence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma   was the primary endpoint. HRs and interaction terms were estimated using Cox models. Results: A favorable HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) could be demonstrated for postmenopausal status (HR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.82 vs. HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.30-1.76 in premenopausal women;     = 0.13), women with estradiol less than 15.8 pg/mL, presence of menopausal symptoms at baseline, and never smoking (    = 0.07), although the interaction   value was >0.05 for all characteristics. Efficacy was similar in all body mass index categories. Tumors with Ki-67 above the median level of 10% had a greater benefit (HR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.81) than those with Ki-67 ≤10% (HR = 1.58; 95% CI, 0.45-5.60;     = 0.04). Conclusion: The efficacy of low-dose tamoxifen seems to be greater in postmenopausal women and in women with lower estradiol levels. Benefits appear to be larger also in women with menopausal symptoms, never smokers, and tumors with Ki-67 >10%. Our results by menopausal status provide important insight into low-dose tamoxifen personalized treatment, although caution is necessary given their exploratory nature. Observation of an improved response in tumors with Ki-67 >10% is consistent but the use of the marker in this setting is investigational. .",

        "abstract": "Background: The role of zoledronic acid (ZOL), a bone-targeted bisphosphonate, in the treatment of patients with breast cancer remains an active area of study. Here, we report the long-term outcomes of a randomized placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial in which ZOL treatment was added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with locally advanced breast cancer. Methods: 120 women with clinical stage II-III (≥ T2 and/or ≥ N1) newly diagnosed breast cancer were randomized to receive either 4 mg intravenous ZOL every 3 weeks for 1 year (17 total doses) beginning with the first dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. Clinical endpoints included time to recurrence (TTR), time to bone recurrence (TTBR), time to non-bone recurrence (TTNBR), breast cancer survival (BCS) and overall survival (OS). Results: With a median follow-up interval of 14.4 years, there were no significant differences in any of the clinical endpoints studied between the control and ZOL groups in the overall study population. However, ER+/HER2- patients younger than age 45 who were treated with ZOL had significantly worse TTR and TTNBR with a trend towards worse TTBR, BCS and OS (TTR: P = 0.024, HR 6.05 [1.26-29.1]; TTNBR: P = 0.026, HR 6.94 [1.26-38.1]; TTBR: P = 0.054, HR 6.01 [0.97-37.1]; BCS: P = 0.138, HR 4.43 [0.62-31.7]; OS: P = 0.138, HR 4.43 [0.62-31.7]). These differences were not seen in older ER+/HER2- patients or triple-negative patients of any age. Conclusion: Addition of ZOL to neoadjuvant therapy did not significantly affect clinical outcomes in the overall study population but was associated with increased extra-skeletal recurrence and a trend towards worse survival in ER+/HER2- patients younger than age 45. These findings suggest caution when using zoledronic acid in young, premenopausal women with locally advanced breast cancer and warrant further investigation.

Understanding factors associated with adherence may help inform efforts to improve use of AET as prescribed. The present systematic review examined potentially modifiable factors associated with adherence to AET in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42019124200). All studies were included, whether factors were significantly associated with adherence or results were null. This review also accounted for the frequency with which a potentially modifiable factor was examined and whether univariate or multivariate models were used. This review also examined whether methodological or sample characteristics were associated with the likelihood of a factor being associated with AET adherence. A total of 68 articles were included. Potentially modifiable factors were grouped into six categories: side effects, attitudes toward AET, psychological factors, healthcare provider-related factors, sociocultural factors, and general/quality of life factors. Side effects were less likely to be associated with adherence in studies with retrospective or cross-sectional than prospective designs. Self-efficacy (psychological factor) and positive decisional balance (attitude toward AET) were the only potentially modifiable factors examined ≥10 times and associated with adherence or persistence ≥75% of the time in both univariate and multivariate models. Self-efficacy and decisional balance (i.e., weight of pros vs. cons) were the potentially modifiable factors most consistently associated with adherence, and hence may be worth focusing on as targets for interventions to improve AET adherence among breast cancer survivors.",

Suboptimal AET adherence is common, but data are lacking about symptoms and adherence in racial/ethnic minorities. We evaluated adherence by race and the relationship between symptoms and adherence. Methods: The Women's Hormonal Initiation and Persistence study included women diagnosed with nonrecurrent HR  breast cancer who initiated AET. AET adherence was captured using validated items. Data regarding patient (e.g., race), medication-related (e.g., symptoms), cancer care delivery (e.g., communication), and clinicopathologic factors (e.g., chemotherapy) were collected via surveys and medical charts. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with adherence. Results: Of the 570 participants, 92% were privately insured and nearly one of three were Black. Thirty-six percent reported nonadherent behaviors. In multivariable analysis, women less likely to report adherent behaviors were Black (vs. White; OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27-0.67;   < 0.001) and with greater symptom burden (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00;   < 0.05).

Methods: In a population-based case-control study, we performed sequencing using a custom multigene amplicon-based panel to identify germline pathogenic variants in 28 cancer-predisposition genes among 32,247 women with breast cancer (case patients) and 32,544 unaffected women (controls) from population-based studies in the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium. Associations between pathogenic variants in each gene and the risk of breast cancer were assessed. Results: Pathogenic variants in 12 established breast cancer-predisposition genes were detected in 5.03% of case patients and in 1.63% of controls. Pathogenic variants in   and   were associated with a high risk of breast cancer, with odds ratios of 7.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.33 to 11.27) and 5.23 (95% CI, 4.09 to 6.77), respectively. Pathogenic variants in   were associated with a moderate risk (odds ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 2.68 to 5.63).

Pathogenic variants in 16 candidate breast cancer-predisposition genes, including the c.657_661del5 founder pathogenic variant in  , were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Conclusion: This study provides estimates of the prevalence and risk of breast cancer associated with pathogenic variants in known breast cancer-predisposition genes in the U.S. population. These estimates can inform cancer testing and screening and improve clinical management strategies for women in the general population with inherited pathogenic variants in these genes.

        "abstract": "Background: In Europe, inappropriate reimbursement and funding rules and regulations act as disincentives to best breast cancer care or, at worst, hinder best care. This problem was the focus of the 12th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC) manifesto, discussed during the virtual conference. As patient involvement is indispensable in driving changes to clinical practice, Europa Donna the European patient advocacy group was closely involved in the 12th manifesto. Reimbursement policies have rarely evolved with advances in breast cancer care such as outpatient (ambulatory) care rather than inpatient admission, use of oral or subcutaneous anti-cancer drugs rather than day-hospital intravenous administration, oncoplastic surgery techniques to minimize mastectomy rates, breast reconstructive surgery, risk-reducing surgery for BRCA mutation carriers, or use of hypo-fractionated breast radiation therapy. Although each European country, region and centre will have to understand how their reimbursement policies may hinder best care and find their own solutions, the problems are similar throughout Europe and some solutions can be broadly applied. This manifesto is not calling for more funding or demanding changes that will result in more expensive care. Reimbursement, if better aligned with guidelines and optimal clinical practice, will deliver more cost-effective healthcare. This will release resources, support more equitable use of finite funding and resources, so allowing more European breast cancer patients to benefit from evidence-based treatment recommended by national and international guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Background: Palbociclib added to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer. The PALLAS trial aimed to investigate whether the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival over endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer. Methods: PALLAS is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 406 cancer centres in 21 countries worldwide with stage II-III histologically confirmed hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, within 12 months of initial diagnosis. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of random size (4 or 6), stratified by anatomic stage, previous chemotherapy, age, and geographical region, by use of central telephone-based and web-based interactive response technology, to receive either 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with ongoing standard provider or patient-choice adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, with or without concurrent luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist), or endocrine therapy alone, without masking. The primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who started palbociclib or endocrine therapy. This report presents results from the second pre-planned interim analysis triggered on Jan 9, 2020, when 67% of the total number of expected invasive disease-free survival events had been observed. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and EudraCT (2014-005181-30). Results: Between Sept 1, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 5760 patients were randomly assigned to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (n=2883) or endocrine therapy alone (n=2877). At the time of the planned second interim analysis, at a median follow-up of 23·7 months (IQR 16·9-29·2), 170 of 2883 patients assigned to palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 181 of 2877 assigned to endocrine therapy alone had invasive disease-free survival events. 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 88·2% (95% CI 85·2-90·6) for palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 88·5% (85·8-90·7) for endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·76-1·15]; log-rank p=0·51). As the test statistic comparing invasive disease-free survival between groups crossed the prespecified futility boundary, the independent data monitoring committee recommended discontinuation of palbociclib in patients still receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (1742 [61·3%] of 2840 patients on palbociclib and endocrine therapy vs 11 [0·3%] of 2903 on endocrine therapy alone), leucopenia (857 [30·2%] vs three [0·1%]), and fatigue (60 [2·1%] vs ten [0·3%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 351 (12·4%) of 2840 patients on palbociclib plus endocrine therapy versus 220 (7·6%) of 2903 patients on endocrine therapy alone. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: At the planned second interim analysis, addition of 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy did not improve invasive disease-free survival compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone. On the basis of these findings, this regimen cannot be recommended in the adjuvant setting. Long-term follow-up of the PALLAS population and correlative studies are ongoing.",

Thinking carefully about the quality of the hormone measurements in these studies is, however, of major importance, as this attention to methods may prevent false conclusions and inappropriate follow-up studies. We discuss issues regarding hormone measurements that one should consider, ideally prior to starting, or otherwise, as they arise during a scientific study: quality of the technique, expertise, matrices, timing and storage conditions, freeze-thaw cycles, lot-to-lot and day-to-day variation, analyses per batch or sample-wise, singlicate or duplicate measurements, combining methods, and standardization. This article and the examples mentioned herein aim to clarify the need to pay attention to the hormone analyses, and to help in making decisions. In addition, these examples help editors and reviewers of scientific journals to pay attention to the methods section in the submitted manuscripts and ask the right critical questions when needed.",

Scarcer yet are outcomes data in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the setting of newer mastectomy techniques, such as skin-sparing mastectomies (SSM) and nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM). Methods: Data were extracted from the medical records of BRCA1/2 carriers who were diagnosed with BC and treated at a single institution between 2006 and 2020. The data extracted included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, disease stage, surgical treatment, use of radiation therapy (RT), and disease outcome. Results: Overall, 255 BC patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutations were identified. Of these, 128 (50.2%) underwent a mastectomy (SSM or NSM in 82% of them), 76 (59.4%) without postmastectomy RT (non-PMRT) and 52 (40.6%) with PMRT, whereas 127 (49.8%) elected for breast-conserving treatment (BCT). The non-PMRT group had earlier disease stages (82.3% were Tis and T1N0) compared with the PMRT and BCT groups (3.6% and 48.1%, respectively; P < .05). The IBTR cumulative rate was 9 of 76 (11.8%) in the non-PMRT cohort compared with 0 of 52 in the PMRT group (P = .01) and 6 of 127 (4.7%) in the BCT group (P = .06). The cumulative incidences of IBTR at 5 and 10 years were 9.8% and 27.4%, respectively, in the non-PMRT group versus 2% and 11.3%, respectively, in the BCT group (P = .0183). No significant difference in overall survival was observed at the time of follow-up. Conclusion: BRCA1/2 mutation carriers treated with mastectomy without PMRT had higher rates of IBTR than those who underwent mastectomy and PMRT or BCT, despite earlier stages of disease. The safety of SSM/NSM should be evaluated in a prospective trial.",

This study's objectives were to (1) describe the trends in the rates of unilateral and bilateral mastectomy (BM) in women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer (UBC) in Ontario, Canada from 1991 to 2013, and (2) identify factors associated with BM to treat UBC. Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis included all women aged 18 and older diagnosed with UBC between January 1991 and December 2013. Health administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, the Ontario Cancer Registry, and the Discharge Abstract Database were used to identify all breast cancer and mastectomy cases. Age-adjusted mastectomy rates were plotted over time. Univariable and multivariable analyses included clinically significant covariates. Results: From 1991 to 2013 there were 172,165 cases of UBC and 64,886 mastectomies (37.7%) performed in Ontario. 13.6% of the mastectomies were bilateral. BM rates increased over sixfold (from 4 to 25%) across all age groups under age 70 over a 23-year period. On multivariable analysis, younger age, higher income, rural community, earlier breast cancer stage, lobular histology, availability of reconstruction and teaching hospitals were associated with increased odds of BM. Conclusion: This is the largest population study of breast cancer patients in Canada and shows an increasing rate of BM for UBC. The results are similar to those already described in the US and highlight the importance of continued efforts to promote efficient communication and evidence-based decision-making prior to breast surgery.",

Methods: This meta-analysis was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2019 for studies comparing the diagnostic performance of ABB-MRI and FDP-MRI in the breast. Studies were reviewed by two authors independently according to eligibility and exclusion criteria and split into two subgroups (screening population studies and studies using cohorts enriched with known cancers) to avoid bias. Quality assessment and bias for diagnostic accuracy was determined with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The diagnostic accuracy for each subgroup was pooled using a bivariate random effects model and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves produced. Sensitivities and specificities were compared using a paired t-test. Results: Five screening (62/2,588 cancers/patients) and eight enriched cohort (540/1,432 cancers/patients) studies were included in the meta-analysis. QUADAS-2 assessment showed a low risk of bias in most studies. The pooled sensitivity/specificity/area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for screening studies was 0.90/0.92/0.94 for ABB-MRI and 0.92/0.95/0.97 for FDP-MRI. The pooled sensitivity/specificity/AUC for enriched cohort studies was 0.93/0.83/0.94 for ABB-MRI and 0.93/0.84/0.95 for FDP-MRI. There was no significant difference in sensitivity or specificity using ABB-MRI or FDP-MRI (p=0.18 and 0.27, p=0.18 and 0.93, respectively). Conclusion: The diagnostic performances of the ABB-MRI and FDP-MRI protocols used in either screening or enriched cohorts were comparable.

        "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have shown that breast cancer patients with a low socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to undergo postmastectomy immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). However, these studies were performed in countries with unequal access to healthcare. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether SES also contributes to the likelihood of receiving IBR in a country with equal access to healthcare. Methods: Patients with stage I or II breast cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2018 who underwent mastectomy were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. SES was calculated from the average incomes of each postal code which were divided into 10-deciles. Primary outcome was the effect of SES on the likelihood of receiving IBR, controlled for patient, tumour and hospital characteristics expressed as Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Higher SES significantly increased the probability of undergoing postmastectomy IBR (OR 1.05 per 10% SES stratum), just as larger hospital volume (average volume OR 1.89 and large volume 2.58), oestrogen positive tumours (OR 1.19) and neo-adjuvant therapy (OR 1.42). In contrast, factors significantly reducing the likelihood of receiving IBR were older age (OR 0.92 per year), stage II (OR 0.61 compared to stage I) and adjuvant therapy (OR 0.56). Conclusion: Women with lower SES undergoing mastectomy were less likely to receive postmastectomy IBR. More research is warranted to study whether lifestyle factors associated with lower SES such as smoking and higher BMI, language barrier, illiteracy and less access to internet explain these differences.",

        "abstract": "Background: Many patients with HR+, HER2- early breast cancer (EBC) will not experience recurrence or have distant recurrence with currently available standard therapies. However, up to 30% of patients with high-risk clinical and/or pathologic features may experience distant recurrence, many in the first few years. Superior treatment options are needed to prevent early recurrence and development of metastases for this group of patients. Abemaciclib is an oral, continuously dosed, CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC). Efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in ABC supported evaluation in the adjuvant setting. Methods: This open-label, phase III study included patients with HR+, HER2-, high-risk EBC, who had surgery and, as indicated, radiotherapy and/or adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with four or more positive nodes, or one to three nodes and either tumor size ≥ 5 cm, histologic grade 3, or central Ki-67 ≥ 20%, were eligible and randomly assigned (1:1) to standard-of-care adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) with or without abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily for 2 years). The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and secondary end points included distant relapse-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results: At a preplanned efficacy interim analysis, among 5,637 randomly assigned patients, 323 IDFS events were observed in the intent-to-treat population. Abemaciclib plus ET demonstrated superior IDFS versus ET alone (  = .01; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.93), with 2-year IDFS rates of 92.2% versus 88.7%, respectively. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of abemaciclib. Conclusion: Abemaciclib when combined with ET is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to demonstrate a significant improvement in IDFS in patients with HR+, HER2- node-positive EBC at high risk of early recurrence.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the preferences of women treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) for breast cancer. Methods: The analyses were conducted into three different groups of early breast cancer patients to evaluate the survival benefit needed to make treatment worthwhile before starting HT (A), after a few months from the beginning (B) and after several years of HT (C). The questionnaires, showing hypothetical scenarios based on potential survival times and rates without HT, were used to determine the lowest gains women judged necessary to make the treatment worthwhile. Results: A total of 452 patients were included in the study: 149 in group A, 150 in group B and 153 in group C. In group C, 65% of patients were receiving HT with aromatase inhibitors (with or without a LHRH analogue). In the groups A, B, C 8%, 20% and 26%, respectively, received adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 355 women (79%) had children. The responses were quite similar between the three groups. A median gain of 10 years was judged necessary to make adjuvant HT worthwhile based on the hypothetical scenario of untreated mean survival time of 5 and 15 years. Median gain of 20% more women surviving was judged necessary to make adjuvant HT worthwhile based on an untreated 5-year survival rate expectation of 60%. Cognitive dysfunction was considered the side effect least compatible with the continuation of treatment in all three groups. Conclusion: This is a large study of patient preferences on HT. Compared with other studies with similar design, the patients included in the present study required larger benefits to make adjuvant therapy worthwhile.",

        "abstract": "Background: The aim of this review is to evaluate associations between possible late effects of cancer treatment (i.e. physical complaints, fatigue, or cognitive complaints) and work ability among workers beyond 2 years after cancer diagnosis who returned to work. The role of job resources (social support, autonomy, leadership style, coaching, and organizational culture) is also evaluated. Methods: The search for studies was conducted in PsycINFO, Medline, Business Source Premier, ABI/Inform, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. A quality assessment was used to clarify the quality across studies. Results: The searches included 2303 records. Finally, 36 studies were included. Work ability seemed to decline shortly after cancer treatment and recover in the first 2 years after diagnosis, although it might still be lower than among healthy workers. No data were available on the course of work ability beyond the first 2 years. Late physical complaints, fatigue and cognitive complaints were negatively related with work ability across all relevant studies. Furthermore, social support and autonomy were associated with higher work ability, but no data were available on a possible buffering effect of these job resources on the relationship between late effects and work ability. As far as reported, most research was carried out among salaried workers. Conclusion: It is unknown if late effects of cancer treatment diminish work ability beyond two years after being diagnosed with cancer. Therefore, more longitudinal research into the associations between possible late effects of cancer treatment and work ability needs to be carried out. Moreover, research is needed on the buffering effect of job resources, both for salaried and self-employed workers.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer has distinct causes, prognoses, and outcomes and effects in patients at premenopausal and postmenopausal ages. We sought to assess the global burden and trends in breast cancer by menopausal status. Methods: We did a population-based analysis of global breast cancer incidence and mortality among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Menopausal status was defined using age as a proxy, whereby breast cancer cases or deaths at age 50 years or older were regarded as postmenopausal. Age-standardised breast cancer incidence and mortality in 2018 were calculated using GLOBOCAN data. Incidence trends for 1998-2012 were assessed in 44 populations from 41 countries using the Cancer in Five Continents plus database, by calculating the annual average percent change. Results: Approximately 645 000 premenopausal and 1·4 million postmenopausal breast cancer cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2018, with more than 130 000 and 490 000 deaths occurring in each menopausal group, respectively. Proportionally, countries with a low UNDP human development index (HDI) faced a greater burden of premenopausal breast cancer for both new cases and deaths compared with higher income countries. Countries with a very high HDI had the highest premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer incidence (30·6 and 253·6 cases per 100 000, respectively), whereas countries with low and medium HDI had the highest premenopausal and postmenopausal mortality, respectively (8·5 and 53·3 deaths per 100 000, respectively). When examining breast cancer trends, we noted significantly increasing age-standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) for premenopausal breast cancer in 20 of 44 populations and significantly increasing ASIRs for postmenopausal breast cancer in 24 of 44 populations. The growth exclusively at premenopausal ages largely occurred in high-income countries, whereas the increasing postmenopausal breast cancer burden was most notable in countries under transition. Conclusion: We provide evidence of a rising burden of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer worldwide. Although early diagnosis and access to treatment remain crucial in low-income and middle-income countries, primary prevention efforts seeking to decrease exposure to known breast cancer risk factors are warranted in all world regions to curb the future breast cancer burden.",

The recently published results on the improvement of the overall survival of pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy, while preserving, and in some items improving their QoL, will change the landscape of the management of this patient population. Their extended survival and potential improvement in QoL will, therefore, modify their specific needs in terms of psychosocial support. The complexity of the care of young women with MBC is described herein, based on an extensive literature review. Further research about the specific psychosocial requirements of these women and a new multidisciplinary holistic approach is paramount to properly address their concerns and preferences. The communication with and support of their partners, parents and children is an important factor affecting the QoL of these patients. Altogether, a multidisciplinary care, open communication and personalized support is required to address the psychosocial implications of the new prognostic expectations on these patients with the incorporation of new targeted therapies.",

Methods: This was a prospective observational cohort study that included 136 patients with breast cancer below 40 years who received GnRHa during chemotherapy for fertility preservation. Plasma anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were measured before chemotherapy (baseline) and after chemotherapy. Subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the interval between the start of GnRHa and the start of chemotherapy for analysis: 1-6 days, 7-13 days, and ≥ 14 days. The ratio of the post-chemotherapy AMH value to the baseline AMH (pcAMH) at each time point were compared among the 3 groups. Ranked analysis of covariance was used for statistical analysis, adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and the existence of polycystic ovaries (PCOs). In addition, recovery of ovarian function (AMH ≥ 1 ng/mL) at 12 months was evaluated. Results: The median age of the patients was 32 years. There was no difference in the baseline AMH levels among the 3 groups (mean ± standard error: 5.0 ± 0.4 ng/mL [1-6 days], 5.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL [7-13 days], and 8.1 ± 1.3 ng/mL [≥ 14 days];   = 0.250). The pcAMH at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were not significantly different among the 3 groups ( -values were 0.332, 0.732, 0.830, 0.148, and 0.393, respectively). In multivariate analysis, young age (  = 0.024), low BMI (  = 0.013), and the existence of PCO (  = 0.015) were predictors for AMH ≥ 1 ng/mL at 12 months. Conclusion: There was no difference in the ovarian protective effect according to the difference in the timing of administration of GnRHa.",

In our case report, a 28-year-old nulligravid Caucasian woman diagnosed with breast cancer underwent controlled ovarian stimulation-oocyte cryopreservation before chemotherapy. The oocyte retrieval was performed without complications and the woman was discharged after five hours. Three days later, the patient self-injected depot-GnRHa as chemoprotective agent, as indicated by the oncologist. The next day, the patient referred to the emergency room and she was diagnosed with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and required inpatient care. As a consequence, the start of the chemotherapy was delayed by two weeks. In conclusion, chemoprotection with depot-GnRHa after oocyte/embryo cryopreservation is not exempt from risks. The timing for depot-GnRHa administration should be established by the agreement between oncologist and gynecologist in order to avoid the risk of OHSS.",

        "abstract": "Background: The OPTION trial results showed that premenopausal women with early stage breast cancer (EBC) receiving chemotherapy benefited from ovarian function protection with goserelin. The impact of treatments on patient reported Quality of Life (QoL) were also examined. Methods: 227 pre-menopausal women with EBC, were randomly assigned to chemotherapy±goserelin (C±G); 132 (58%) were ER-ve. Patients were stratified by age (≤40 years and >40 years). QoL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast, and Endocrine Symptom checklist at baseline (pre-treatment), 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, then annually to 5 years. Treatment Outcome Index (TOI) score was the primary outcome. Results: 213 patients were available for QoL analysis. There was a significant decrease in TOI scores for both treatment groups at 3 and 6 months that returned to pre-treatment levels at 12 months, then continued to increase reflecting improved QoL. By 3 months there was a significant difference from baseline in both groups for menopausal symptoms, and between groups in the proportion experiencing hot flushes at any time. The C + G group experienced higher levels of vasomotor symptoms generally during the treatment phase; by 24 months, the short-term negative effect of goserelin was reversed, with hot flushes twice as frequent in the chemotherapy only group (40.9% vs 21.3%). Conclusion: These results show that young women diagnosed with breast cancer experienced only a short-term decrease in QoL from the addition of goserelin, in order to preserve ovarian function during chemotherapy treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: The stage-specific survival of young breast cancer patients has improved, likely due to diagnostic and treatment advances. We addressed whether survival improvements have reached all socioeconomic groups in a country with universal health care and national treatment guidelines. Methods: Using Norwegian registry data, we assessed stage-specific breast cancer survival by education and income level of 7501 patients (2317 localized, 4457 regional, 233 distant and 494 unknown stage) aged 30-48 years at diagnosis during 2000-2015. Using flexible parametric models and national life tables, we compared excess mortality up to 12 years from diagnosis and 5-year relative survival trends, by education and income as measures of socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Throughout 2000-2015, regional and distant stage 5-year relative survival improved steadily for patients with high education and high income (high SES), but not for patients with low education and low income (low SES). Regional stage 5-year relative survival improved from 85 to 94% for high SES patients (9% change; 95% confidence interval: 6, 13%), but remained at 84% for low SES patients (0% change; - 12, 12%). Distant stage 5-year relative survival improved from 22 to 58% for high SES patients (36% change; 24, 49%), but remained at 11% for low SES patients (0% change; - 19, 19%). Conclusion: Regional and distant stage breast cancer survival has improved markedly for high SES patients, but there has been little survival gain for low SES patients.

Methods: Participants were 708 women diagnosed at ≤45 years with stage I-III breast cancer. 90% were non-Hispanic white, 76% were married/partnered and 67% had ≥4-year college degree. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression examined the associations between demographic, lifestyle and clinical factors with job and insurance problems. Results: 18-months after diagnosis, 56% of participants worked full-time, 16% part-time, 18% were homemakers and/or students, 4.5% were unemployed, and 2.4% were disabled. The majority (86%) had private insurance. Job-related problems were reported by 40% of women, and included believing they could not change jobs for fear of losing health insurance (35.0%), being fired (2.3%), and being demoted, denied promotion or denied wage increases (7.8%). Greater job-related problems were associated with being overweight vs. under/normal weight (p = 0.006), income <$50,000/per year (p = 0.01), and working full-time vs. part-time (p = 0.003). Insurance problems were reported by 27% of women, and included being denied health insurance (2.6%), health insurance increases (4.3%), being denied health benefit payments (14.8%) or denied life insurance (11.4%). Insurance problems were associated with being under/normal weight vs. obese (p = 0.01), not being on hormone therapy (p < 0.001), and a tumor size > 5 cm vs. < 2 cm (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Young survivors experienced significant job- and insurance-related issues following diagnosis.

However, limited research has been conducted to identify dying concerns in an ill parent as the research has focused on older adults. Methods: Our goal was to identify dying concerns that PWAC are expressing and to understand how these concerns affect measurable outcomes. Results: CINHAL, MEDLINE, PsychARTICLES, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstracts, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection were searched.

So far, its effectiveness has not been well studied, which is in part due to the contextuality of CAM along with a lack of information of why patients use it. Methods: Young BC patients constitute a special patient group regarding clinical characteristics, QOL, and their role in society. Since little is known about their CAM use, this study aimed at exploring it as well as their reasons for CAM use. Results: Data on CAM and sociodemographics were collected via questionnaire in the context of a rehabilitation program for young mothers with BC. Initial BC diagnoses were between 2009 and 2014 (recruitment period 2012-2015). Clinical characteristics were derived from the patient files. Descriptive statistics were used to describe frequencies and statistically significant differences were tested. Conclusion: Among the 827 patients, with an average age of 39.6 years, 62.5% had used CAM with regard to their cancer. CAM use was significantly higher in women with higher educational level, higher employment status, and statutory health insurance, respectively. The average monthly expenses on CAM were EUR 50. Every 5th woman used CAM without her physician's knowledge. The types most often used were dietary supplements with vitamins or minerals. The most frequent reasons for CAM use were to strengthen the immune system, support conventional medicine, and combat side effects.",

Methods: In this non-inferior randomized phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 308 chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically confirmed TNBC after primary surgery to receive either six cycles of TP (docetaxel: 75 mg/m  or paclitaxel 175 mg/m  d1; carboplatin AUC = 5, day 1), or four cycles of EC (epirubicin: 90 mg/m ; cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m , day 1) followed by four cycles of T (docetaxel: 75 mg/m  or paclitaxel 175 mg/m , day 1). The primary end point was the disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 5 years. Both regimens were repeated every 3 weeks. The prognostic and predictive value of germline breast cancer gene mutations and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression was evaluated. Results: At a median follow-up of 66.9 months, the 5-year DFS rate was 85.8% in the EC-T arm, and 84.4% in the TP arm (p non-inferiority = 0.034, p log-rank = 0.712).

Patients in the TP arm showed better compliance and experienced significantly lower frequencies of G3/4 neutrocytopenia and G3/4 alopecia, but higher rates of G1-4 thrombocytopenia than those in the EC-T arm. Patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors showed significantly improved DFS and OS. Conclusion: This study indicates that carboplatin plus taxanes could be a feasible adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with early TNBC who are cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy with anthracycline.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) established a series of resource-stratified, evidence-based guidelines to address breast cancer control in the context of available resources. Here, the authors describe methodologies and health system prerequisites to support the translation and implementation of these guidelines into practice. Methods: In October 2018, the BHGI convened the Sixth Global Summit on Improving Breast Healthcare Through Resource-Stratified Phased Implementation. The purpose of the summit was to define a stepwise methodology (phased implementation) for guiding the translation of resource-appropriate breast cancer control guidelines into real-world practice. Three expert consensus panels developed stepwise, resource-appropriate recommendations for implementing these guidelines in low-income and middle-income countries as well as underserved communities in high-income countries. Each panel focused on 1 of 3 specific aspects of breast cancer care: 1) early detection, 2) treatment, and 3) health system strengthening. Results: Key findings from the summit and subsequent article preparation included the identification of phased-implementation prerequisites that were explored during consensus debates. These core issues and concepts are key components for implementing breast health care that consider real-world resource constraints. Communication and engagement across all levels of care is vital to any effectively operating health care system, including effective communication with ministries of health and of finance, to demonstrate needs, outcomes, and cost benefits. Conclusion: Underserved communities at all economic levels require effective strategies to deploy scarce resources to ensure access to timely, effective, and affordable health care. Systematically strategic approaches translating guidelines into practice are needed to build health system capacity to meet the current and anticipated global breast cancer burden.",

Results: Cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos is an established method for FP in women with BC. Recent improvements to COS protocols include concomitant use of letrozole, random-cycle start day of stimulation and the use of GnRHa for the egg maturation trigger.

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with rapidly increasing incidence rates reported in Uganda and Zimbabwe. However, the magnitude of these rising trends in premenopausal and postmenopausal women is unknown in most African countries. We used data from the African Cancer Registry Network on incident breast cancers in women from 11 population-based cancer registries in 10 countries representing each of the four SSA regions. We explored incidence changes among women before and after age 50 by calendar period and, where possible, generational effects in this unique sub-Saharan African cohort. Temporal trends revealed increasing incidence rates in all registries during the study period, except in Nairobi where rates stabilised during 2010 to 2014 after rapidly increasing from 2003 to 2010 (APC = 8.5 95%, CI: 3.0-14.2). The cumulative risk varied between and within regions, with the highest risks observed in Nairobi-Kenya, Mauritius and the Seychelles. There were similar or more rapidly increasing incidence rates in women aged 50+ compared to women <50 years in all registries except The Gambia. Birth cohort analyses revealed increases in the incidence rates in successive generations of women aged 45 and over in Harare-Zimbabwe and Kampala-Uganda. In conclusion, the incidence of BC is increasing rapidly in many parts of Africa; however, the magnitude of these changes differs. These results highlight the need for urgent actions across the cancer continuum from in-depth risk factor studies to provision of adequate therapy as well as the necessity of supporting the maintenance of good quality population-based cancer registration in Africa.",

        "abstract": "Background: Transgender (TG) individuals have higher rates of mortality associated with cancer diagnoses, in part due to avoidance of gender-assigned cancer screenings resulting in later stages at diagnosis. Knowledge about the risks of breast or gynecological cancer in TG and nonbinary (NB) persons receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy is limited. Even less information exists regarding the subset of individuals with genetic predisposition for these malignancies. We performed a retrospective literature review of studies from the last 15 years on breast cancer rates and identified risks in TG persons. An accumulating body of data on breast cancer incidence in TG persons suggests higher than previously believed rates of breast cancer in TG women compared with cisgender men and risk correlating with duration of hormone use. Few studies have examined other cancer risks in TG populations. To date, only three publications address the association with BRCA1/2 mutation presence and breast cancer incidence in TG persons. Meanwhile, there is growing awareness and social acceptance of TG/NB identities coupled with recognition of gender dysphoria at increasingly earlier ages. No information directly addressing cancer risk counseling in TG/NB adolescents and young adults with a family history of cancer or hereditary cancer syndrome exists. Whether the presence of a known genetic predisposition or strong family cancer history may affect cancer risk in these populations is unknown, leading to significant gaps in clinicians' ability to accurately and appropriately estimate cancer risks and counsel those with genetic predisposition on the risks/benefits associated with surgical options and the initiation, duration, and dosing of gender-affirming hormone therapies. A series of three cases illustrates the utility of cancer risk assessment and genetic testing in TG/NB adolescents and young adults, and the unique challenges and unanswered questions that are encountered in the process.",

However, incidence of early-onset and pre-menopausal breast cancer is understudied. We examined age-specific trends in breast cancer incidence between 1971 and 2015, as well as possible trends by birth cohort. Methods: Incidence data were collected from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System and the Canadian Cancer Registry, and annual percent changes were estimated using the Joinpoint Regression Program. Five-year birth cohort models were fit using the National Cancer Institute's web tool. Results: Breast cancer incidence among women under age 40 has increased since 2000, while incidence under 50 has remained stable. Rates of post-menopausal breast cancer declined sharply and have recently plateaued. More recent birth cohorts are at a non-significantly increased risk of breast cancer compared with the reference, with an increasing upward trend. Conclusion: Rates of breast cancer may be increasing among younger women, and there is suggestive evidence that more recent birth cohorts are at increased risk of the disease. More research is needed into the risk factors for pre-menopausal breast cancer to support primary prevention efforts in this area.",

To intervene effectively, it is important to understand how the breast cancer experience impacts partners. The purpose of this study was to compare QoL between partners of young BCS and partners of healthy acquaintance controls. Methods: Partners of young BCS (3-8 years post treatment and ≤ 45 years old at diagnosis) and partners of age-matched healthy acquaintance controls completed questionnaires on overall, physical (physical function, sexual difficulty), social (personal resources, sexual enjoyment, marital satisfaction, partner social support, social constraints, parenting satisfaction), psychological (depressive symptoms), and spiritual (behaviors, beliefs, and activities) QoL. Analyses included descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA to compare partner groups on all study variables. Results: Although partners of young BCS (n = 227) reported fewer social constraints (p < .001), they reported lower overall QoL (p < .001), fewer personal resources (p < .001), more sexual difficulty (p = .019), less sexual enjoyment (p = .002), less marital satisfaction (p = .019), more depressive symptoms (p = .024), and fewer spiritual behaviors (p < .001), beliefs (p = .001) and activities (p = .003) compared to partners of healthy acquaintance controls (n = 170). Additional analysis showed that perceptions that the relationship changed for the better since cancer, social constraints, partner social support, and depression predicted marital satisfaction among partners of young BCS. Conclusion: Partners of young BCS are at risk for poorer overall, physical, social, psychological, and spiritual QoL compared to partners of healthy women. Interventions targeting QoL domains may enable partners to effectively support their partner and improve their QoL.",

This study aims to evaluate the insurance, employment, and financial experiences of young female breast cancer survivors and to assess factors associated with financial decline. Methods: We recruited 830 women under 40 years of age diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2013 and December 2014. The study population was identified through California, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina population-based cancer registries. The cross-sectional survey was fielded in 2017 and included questions on demographics, insurance, employment, out-of-pocket costs, and financial well-being. We present descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis to assess factors associated with financial decline. Results: Although 92.5% of the respondents were continuously insured over the past 12 months, 9.5% paid a \"higher price than expected\" for coverage. Common concerns among the 73.4% of respondents who were employed at diagnosis included increased paid (55.1%) or unpaid (47.3%) time off, suffering job performance (23.2%), and staying at (30.2%) or avoiding changing (23.5%) jobs for health insurance purposes. Overall, 47.0% experienced financial decline due to treatment-related costs. Patients with some college education, multiple comorbidities, late stage diagnoses, and self-funded insurance were most vulnerable. Conclusion: The breast cancer diagnosis created financial hardship for half the respondents and led to myriad challenges in maintaining employment. Employment decisions were heavily influenced by the need to maintain health insurance coverage.",

        "abstract": "Background: Whether radiation therapy (RT) affects contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk in women with pathogenic germline variants in moderate- to high-penetrance breast cancer-associated genes is unknown. In a population-based case-control study, we examined the association between RT; variants in ATM, BRCA1/2, or CHEK2*1100delC; and CBC risk. We analyzed 708 cases of women with CBC and 1399 controls with unilateral breast cancer, all diagnosed with first invasive breast cancer between 1985 and 2000 and aged younger than 55 years at diagnosis and screened for variants in breast cancer-associated genes. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable conditional logistic regression. RT did not modify the association between known pathogenic variants and CBC risk (eg, BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers without RT: RR = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.76 to 7.01; BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers with RT: RR = 4.46, 95% CI = 2.96 to 6.71), suggesting that modifying RT plans for young women with breast cancer is unwarranted. Rare ATM missense variants, not currently identified as pathogenic, were associated with increased risk of RT-associated CBC (carriers of ATM rare missense variants of uncertain significance without RT: RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.09 to 1.55; carriers of ATM rare missense variants of uncertain significance with RT: RR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.31 to 6.80).

Limited data exist for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (+) breast cancer among   carriers. INFORM is a randomized, multicenter, phase II trial comparing pathologic complete response (pCR) rates (ypT0/is, N0) after neoadjuvant single-agent cisplatin (CDDP) versus doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (AC) in   carriers with stage I-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Secondary objectives included residual cancer burden scores (RCB) of 0 or 1 (combined) and toxicity. The goal was to determine whether pCR was ≥ 20% higher with CDDP than AC. Methods: carriers with cT1-3 (≥ 1.5 cm), cN0-3 HER2-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to preoperative CDDP (75 mg/m  every 3 weeks × 4 doses) or AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m ; cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m  every 2-3 weeks × 4 doses) followed by surgery. Pathologic responses were confirmed by central review. Results: A total of 118 patients were randomly assigned; 117 were included in outcome analyses. Mean age was 42 years (range, 24-73 years); 69% were  +, 30% were  +, and 2% had both mutations. Clinical stage was I for 19%, II for 63%, and III for 18%; 45% had nodal involvement at baseline. Seventy percent had TNBC. Clinical and tumor characteristics were well matched between treatment arms. The pCR rate was 18% with CDDP and 26% with AC, yielding a risk ratio (RR) of 0.70 (90% CI, 0.39 to 1.2). The risk of RCB 0 or 1 (RCB 0/1) was 33% with CDDP and 46% with AC (RR, 0.73; 90% CI, 0.50 to 1.1). Both regimens were generally well tolerated without unexpected toxicities. Conclusion: pCR or RCB 0/1 is not significantly higher with CDDP than with AC in   carriers with stage I-III HER2-negative breast cancer for both TNBC and ER+/HER2-negative disease.",

This is not explained by regional differences in patient age distribution or tumour characteristics, but by differences in patient-reported information and patient involvement in the decision-making process. As socioeconomic status may play a significant role in surgical decision-making, its potential associations with IBR rates were analysed. Methods: Women who had undergone therapeutic mastectomy for primary breast cancer in Sweden in 2013 were included in the analysis. Tumour and treatment data were retrieved from the Swedish National Breast Cancer Register, and socioeconomic background data from the Central Bureau of Statistics Sweden. Postal questionnaires regarding information about reconstruction and perceived involvement in the preoperative decision-making process had been sent out in a previous survey. Results: In addition to regional differences, lower tumour and nodal category, independent factors increasing the likelihood of having IBR for the 3131 women in the study were living without a registered partner, having current employment and high income per household. Patient-reported perceived preoperative information (odds ratio (OR) 12·73, 95 per cent c.i. 6·03 to 26·89) and the feeling of being involved in the decision-making process (OR 2·56, 1·14 to 5·76) remained strong independent predictors of IBR despite adjustment for socioeconomic factors. Importantly, responders to the survey represented a relatively young and wealthy population with a lower tumour burden. Conclusion: Several socioeconomic factors independently influence IBR rates; however, patient-reported information and involvement in the surgical decision-making process remain independent predictors for the likelihood of having IBR.",

Previous reports lacked detailed clinical data or health-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and did not prospectively assess the combined impact of treatment and related sequelae on employment. Methods: We used a French prospective clinical cohort of patients with stage I-III breast cancer including 1,874 women who were working and ≥ 5 years younger than legal retirement age (≤ 57 years) at breast cancer diagnosis. Our outcome was nonreturn to work (non-RTW) 2 years after diagnosis. Independent variables included treatment characteristics as well as toxicities (Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4) and PROs (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality of life Questionnaires, Breast cancer module [QLQ-BR23] and Fatigue module [QLQ-FA12], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) collected 1 year after diagnosis. Logistic regression models assessed correlates of non-RTW, adjusting for age, stage, comorbidities, and socioeconomic covariates. Results: Two years after diagnosis, 21% of patients had not returned to work. Odds of non-RTW were significantly increased among patients treated with combinations of chemotherapy and trastuzumab (odds ratio [OR]   chemotherapy-hormonotherapy: for chemotherapy-trastuzumab, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.44; for chemotherapy-trastuzumab-hormonotherapy, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.41). Other significant associations with non-RTW included grade ≥ 3 CTCAE toxicities (OR   no, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.18), arm morbidity (OR   no, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.13), anxiety (OR   no, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.11), and depression (OR   no, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.91). Conclusion: Receipt of systemic therapy combinations including trastuzumab was associated with increased odds of non-RTW. Likelihood of unemployment was also higher among patients who reported severe physical and psychological symptoms. This comprehensive study identifies potentially vulnerable patients and warrants supportive interventional strategies to facilitate their RTW.",

Questions and recommendations, expressed as strong or conditional, focused on outcomes that matter to women and provided a rating of the certainty of evidence. Results: This synopsis of the European Breast Guidelines provides recommendations regarding organized screening programs for women aged 40 to 75 years who are at average risk. The recommendations address digital mammography screening and the addition of hand-held ultrasonography, automated breast ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging compared with mammography alone. The recommendations also discuss the frequency of screening and inform decision making for women at average risk who are recalled for suspicious lesions or who have high breast density.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer (BC) accounts for 24% of female cancers, with approximately one quarter of women likely to have offspring aged less than 25 years. Recent publications demonstrate negative psychosocial well-being in these offspring. We prospectively assessed for psychological distress and unmet needs in offspring of BC patients. Methods: Eligible offspring aged 14 to 24 years were consented and completed the Kessler-10 Questionnaire and Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument. Demographic and BC details were obtained. Results: Over a 7-month period, 120 offspring from 74 BC patients were included. Fifty-nine mothers had nonmetastatic BC (nMBC), and 27 had metastatic BC (MBC) with median time from diagnosis of 27.6 and 36.1 months, respectively. The prevalence of high/very high distress was 31%, with significantly higher scores reported by female offspring (P = .017). Unmet needs were reported by more than 50% of offspring with the majority of needs relating to information about their mother's cancer. Greater unmet needs were seen in female offspring and offspring with none or one sibling for several domains (practical assistance, time-out, dealing with feelings, and support from friends; P < .05). Greater unmet needs were seen in regard to feelings for MBC patients' offspring compared with nMBC but were similar for other unmet needs. Conclusion: Our study confirms high levels of psychological distress in offspring of BC patients, with female offspring reporting significantly higher emotional distress and unmet needs. More than 50% of respondents reported unmet needs in areas that can potentially be supported, including greater information provision, improving practical issues, and enabling sufficient recreational time.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT)/Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) showed superior outcomes for premenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant exemestane plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) or tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone. We previously reported the magnitude of absolute improvements in freedom from any recurrence across a continuous, composite measure of recurrence risk to tailor decision making. With longer follow-up, we now focus on distant recurrence. Methods: The TEXT/SOFT HR-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative analysis population included 4,891 women stratified by predetermined chemotherapy use. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 8-year freedom from distant recurrence were analyzed using subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP) methodology across subpopulations defined by the continuous composite measure of recurrence risk. For each patient, the composite risk value was obtained from a Cox model that incorporated age; nodal status; tumor size; grade; and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 labeling index expression levels. Results: The overall rate of 8-year freedom from distant recurrence was 91.1% and ranged from approximately 100% to 63% across lowest to highest composite risks. TEXT patients who received chemotherapy had an average absolute improvement with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS of 5.1%, and STEPP analysis showed improvements from less than 1% to more than 15% from lowest to highest composite risks. SOFT patients who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy had an average 5.2% absolute improvement with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen and reached 10% across composite risks; for tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen, the maximum improvement was approximately 3.5%. Women who did not receive chemotherapy had a more than 97% rate of 8-year freedom from distant recurrence, and improvements with exemestane plus OFS ranged from 1% to 4%. Conclusion: Premenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and high recurrence risk, as defined by clinicopathologic characteristics, may experience a 10% to 15% absolute improvement in 8-year freedom from distant recurrence with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone. The potential benefit of escalating endocrine therapy versus tamoxifen alone is minimal for those at low recurrence risk.",

        "abstract": "Background: This article is the American Cancer Society's biennial update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Over the most recent 5-year period (2012-2016), the breast cancer incidence rate increased slightly by 0.3% per year, largely because of rising rates of local stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, the breast cancer death rate continues to decline, dropping 40% from 1989 to 2017 and translating to 375,900 breast cancer deaths averted. Notably, the pace of the decline has slowed from an annual decrease of 1.9% during 1998 through 2011 to 1.3% during 2011 through 2017, largely driven by the trend in white women. Consequently, the black-white disparity in breast cancer mortality has remained stable since 2011 after widening over the past 3 decades. Nevertheless, the death rate remains 40% higher in blacks (28.4 vs 20.3 deaths per 100,000) despite a lower incidence rate (126.7 vs 130.8); this disparity is magnified among black women aged <50 years, who have a death rate double that of whites. In the most recent 5-year period (2013-2017), the death rate declined in Hispanics (2.1% per year), blacks (1.5%), whites (1.0%), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.8%) but was stable in American Indians/Alaska Natives. However, by state, breast cancer mortality rates are no longer declining in Nebraska overall; in Colorado and Wisconsin in black women; and in Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia in white women. Breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in women (surpassing lung cancer) in four Southern and two Midwestern states among blacks and in Utah among whites during 2016-2017. Declines in breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment services to all women.",

We identified 67 premenopausal, high-risk women age 35-45, without surgical prophylaxis, who did not initiate tamoxifen. Factors associated with noninitiation were examined. About 37% of patients had no documented provider-based discussion regarding initiation. Type of high-risk diagnosis was the only factor associated with a provider-based discussion (P = .03). For patients offered tamoxifen, primary reasons for noninitiation were perceived minimal benefit (66.7%), fertility concerns (16.7%), and concerns about side effects (7.1%). Implementation of comprehensive educational strategies regarding the benefits of tamoxifen should be facilitated to improve initiation among young high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: The addition of ovarian function suppression (OFS) for 5 years to tamoxifen (TAM) for treatment of premenopausal patients with breast cancer after completion of chemotherapy has beneficial effects on disease-free survival (DFS). This study evaluated the efficacy of adding 2 years of OFS to TAM in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who remain in a premenopausal state or resume ovarian function after chemotherapy. Methods: We enrolled 1,483 premenopausal women (age ≤ 45 years) with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with definitive surgery after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ovarian function was assessed every 6 months for 2 years since enrollment on the basis of follicular-stimulating hormone levels and vaginal bleeding history. If ovarian function was confirmed to be premenopausal at each visit, the patient was randomly assigned to complete 5 years of TAM alone (TAM-only) group or 5 years of TAM with OFS for 2 years that involved monthly goserelin administration (TAM + OFS) group. DFS was defined from the time of enrollment to the time of the first event. Results: A total of 1,293 patients were randomly assigned, and 1,282 patients were eligible for analysis. The estimated 5-year DFS rate was 91.1% in the TAM + OFS group and 87.5% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97;   = .033). The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 99.4% in the TAM + OFS group and 97.8% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.94;   = .029). Conclusion: The addition of 2 years of OFS to TAM significantly improved DFS compared with TAM alone in patients who remained premenopausal or resumed ovarian function after chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: To update the ASCO guideline on pharmacologic interventions for breast cancer risk reduction and provide guidance on clinical issues that arise when deciding to use endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction. Methods: An Expert Panel conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify new studies. Results: A randomized clinical trial that evaluated the use of anastrozole for reduction of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast cancer provided the predominant basis for the update. Conclusion: In postmenopausal women at increased risk, the choice of endocrine therapy now includes anastrozole (1 mg/day) in addition to exemestane (25 mg/day), raloxifene (60 mg/day), or tamoxifen (20 mg/day). The decision regarding choice of endocrine therapy should take into consideration age, baseline comorbidities, and adverse effect profiles. Clinicians should not prescribe anastrozole, exemestane, or raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction to premenopausal women. Tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years is still considered standard of care for risk reduction in premenopausal women who are at least 35 years old and have completed childbearing. Data on low-dose tamoxifen as an alternative to the standard dose for both pre- and postmenopausal women with intraepithelial neoplasia are discussed in the Clinical Considerations section of this article.

The HOHO European protocol is a prospective multicenter cohort study of young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, about fertility, psychosocial and quality of life concerns. Here we report the baseline data and focus on predictors of fertility concerns. Methods: Patient surveys and medical record review were used. The baseline survey included sociodemographic, medical and treatment data as well as questions on fertility concerns and preservation strategies. Subscales from the CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System-Short Form (CARES-SF) were administered to measure specific quality of life aspects. Uni- and multivariable modeling were used to investigate predictors of greater fertility concern. Results: Among 297 eligible respondents, 67% discussed fertility issues before starting therapy, 64% were concerned about becoming infertile after treatment, and 15% decided not to follow prescribed therapies. Fifty-four percent of women wished future children before diagnosis; of these, 71% still desired biologic children afterwards. In multivariable analysis, not having children was the only patient characteristic significantly associated with fertility concerns at diagnosis. Twenty-seven percent used fertility preservation strategies. Women who received chemotherapy reported greater physical (p = 0.021) and sexual difficulties (p = 0.039) than women who did not. Women who were married or had a partner reported less psychosocial problems than single women (p = 0.039). Conclusion: Young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer have several concerns, including, but not limited to, fertility. The HOHO European study provides valuable information to develop targeted interventions.",

        "abstract": "Background: The aim of this review was to analyze the respective efficacy of various heart-sparing radiotherapy techniques. Methods: Heart-sparing can be performed in three different ways in breast cancer radiotherapy: by seeking to keep the heart out of treated volumes (i.e. by prone position or specific breathing techniques such as deep inspiration breath-hold [DIBH] and/or gating), by solely irradiating a small volume around the lumpectomy cavity (partial breast irradiation, PBI), or by using modern radiation techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or protons. This overview presents the available data on these three approaches. Results: Studies on prone position are heterogeneous and most trials only refer to patients with large breasts; therefore, no definitive conclusion can be drawn for clinical routine. Nonetheless, there seems to be a trend toward better sparing of the left anterior descending artery in supine position even for these selected patients. The data on the use of DIBH for heart-sparing in breast cancer patients is consistent and the benefit compared to free-breathing is supported by several studies. In comparison with whole breast irradiation (WBI), PBI has an advantage in reducing the heart dose. Of note, DIBH and PBI with multicatheter brachytherapy are similar with regard to the dose reduction to heart structures. WBI by IMRT/VMAT techniques without DIBH is not an effective strategy for heart-sparing in breast cancer patients with \"standard\" anatomy. A combination of DIBH and IMRT may be used for internal mammary radiotherapy. Conclusion: Based on the available findings, the DEGRO breast cancer expert panel recommends the use of DIBH as the best heart-sparing technique. Nonetheless, depending on the treatment volume and localization, other techniques may be employed or combined with DIBH when appropriate.",

        "abstract": "Background: Social determinants of health that have been examined in relation to breast cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and survival include socioeconomic status (income, education), neighborhood disadvantage, unemployment, racial discrimination, social support, and social network. Other social determinants of health include medical distrust, immigration, status, inadequate housing, food insecurity, and geographic factors such as neighborhood access to health services. Socioeconomic factors influence risk of breast cancer. For all racial/ethnic groups, breast cancer incidence rates tend to be positively associated with socioeconomic status. On the other hand, low socioeconomic status is associated with increased risk of aggressive premenopausal breast cancers as well as late stage of diagnosis and poorer survival. There are well-documented disparities in breast cancer survival by socioeconomic status, race, education, census-tract-level poverty, and access to health insurance and preventive care. Poverty is associated with other factors related to late stage at breast cancer diagnosis and poorer survival such as inadequate health insurance, lack of a primary care physician and poor access to health care. Methods: The results of this review indicate that social determinants such as poverty, lack of education, neighborhood disadvantage, residential segregation by race, racial discrimination, lack of social support, and social isolation play an important role in breast cancer stage at diagnosis and survival. Results: To address these social determinants and eliminate cancer disparities, effective interventions are needed that account for the social and environmental contexts in which cancer patients live and are treated.",

Methods: In a phase 3 trial, 1065 premenopausal patients with HR + early breast cancer received triptorelin to suppress ovarian function and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to adjuvant T, L or ZL for 5 years. Cancer recurrence, second breast or non-breast cancer and death were considered events for the intention-to-treat disease-free survival (DFS) analysis. Results: With a 64-month median follow-up and 134 reported events, the disease-free rate at 5 years was 85.4%, 93.2% and 93.3% with T, L and ZL, respectively (overall P = 0.008).

Whether the level of clinical risk of breast cancer recurrence adds prognostic information to the recurrence score is not known. Methods: We performed a prospective trial involving 9427 women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer, in whom an assay of 21 genes had been performed, and we classified the clinical risk of recurrence of breast cancer as low or high on the basis of the tumor size and histologic grade. The effect of clinical risk was evaluated by calculating hazard ratios for distant recurrence with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. The initial endocrine therapy was tamoxifen alone in the majority of the premenopausal women who were 50 years of age or younger. Results: The level of clinical risk was prognostic of distant recurrence in women with an intermediate 21-gene recurrence score of 11 to 25 (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis or a greater potential benefit from chemotherapy) who were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy (hazard ratio for the comparison of high vs. low clinical risk, 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93 to 3.87) or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.48) and in women with a high recurrence score (a score of 26 to 100), all of whom were assigned to chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.19). Among women who were 50 years of age or younger who had received endocrine therapy alone, the estimated (±SE) rate of distant recurrence at 9 years was less than 5% (≤1.8±0.9%) with a low recurrence score (a score of 0 to 10), irrespective of clinical risk, and 4.7±1.0% with an intermediate recurrence score and low clinical risk. In this age group, the estimated distant recurrence at 9 years exceeded 10% among women with a high clinical risk and an intermediate recurrence score who received endocrine therapy alone (12.3±2.4%) and among those with a high recurrence score who received chemoendocrine therapy (15.2±3.3%). Conclusion: Clinical-risk stratification provided prognostic information that, when added to the 21-gene recurrence score, could be used to identify premenopausal women who could benefit from more effective therapy.

        "abstract": "Background: Little is known about how a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment affects job-related outcomes in young women with breast cancer, who are an integral part of the workforce. We sought to describe employment trends among young breast cancer survivors. Methods: 911 women with non-metastatic breast cancer were surveyed about employment-related outcomes 1 year post-diagnosis. Participants were enrolled in the Young Women's Breast Cancer Study an ongoing, multi-center cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer at age ≤ 40. Results: Among 911 women, median age at diagnosis was 36 years (range 17-40). Most women (80%, n = 729) were employed 1 year post-diagnosis. Among the 7% (n = 62) employed before diagnosis but who reported unemployment at 1 year, approximately half reported they were unemployed for health reasons. Among employed women, 7% said treatment affected their ability to perform their job. Women with stage-three disease (vs. stage 1 disease, odds ratio (OR): 3.73, 95% CI 1.39-9.97) and those who reported having money to pay bills after cutting back or difficulty paying bills at baseline (vs. having enough money for special things, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.32-5.52) at baseline were more likely to have transitioned out of the workforce. Conclusion: Our results suggest an impact of disease burden and socioeconomic status on employment in young breast cancer survivors. There is a need to ensure young survivors who leave the workforce following diagnosis are sufficiently supported given the potential adverse psychosocial and financial impacts of unemployment on survivors, their families, communities, and society.",

        "abstract": "Background: Young age is a known factor associated with suboptimal adherence to endocrine therapy (ET) for adjuvant breast cancer (BC) treatment. This study was aimed at assessing nonadherent behaviors and associated factors among young women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive BC. Methods: As part of a multicenter, prospective cohort of women with a diagnosis of BC at or under the age of 40 years, participants were surveyed 30 months after their diagnosis about adherent behaviors. Among those who reported taking ET, adherence was measured with a 3-item Likert-type scale: Do you ever forget to take your ET? If you feel worse when you take your ET, do you stop taking it? Did you take your ET exactly as directed by your doctor over the last 3 months? Women reporting at least 1 nonadherent behavior were classified as nonadherers. Variables with a P value <.20 were included in a multivariable logistic model. Results: Among 384 women, 194 (51%) were classified as nonadherers. Univariate factors that retained significance in the multivariable model included educational level (odds ratio [OR], 0.50 for high vs low; P = .04), level of social support according to the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (OR, 0.98 per 1 point; P = .01), and confidence with the decision regarding ET measured on a 0 to 10 numerical scale (OR, 0.63 for high vs low; P = .04). Conclusion: Findings from this study could help to identify young patients at higher risk for nonadherence. Interventions adapted to the level of education and aimed at reinforcing support and patients' confidence in their decision to take ET could improve adherence and associated outcomes in this population.",

        "abstract": "Background: A diagnosis of breast cancer at a young age, defined per guidelines as ≤ 40 years, represents a challenging situation requiring additional attention by the treating physicians including radiation oncologists and surgeons involved in the local treatment of these tumors. The present review aims at providing updated evidence on the state of the art about the available techniques and indications for radiation therapy in patients with early breast cancer, specifically focusing on young women. In addition, future perspectives including the ongoing trials and the potential impact of combined approaches with systemic therapies (such as immunotherapy) are reviewed. Major conclusions from this overview are that young women affected by invasive breast cancer seem to receive the greatest benefit from the boost on the tumor bed. Most young patients affected by ductal carcinoma in situ should receive postoperative whole breast irradiation (WBI). When regional node irradiation is considered, young age should be considered as a high-risk factor. Partial breast irradiation is not suitable for young patients and should be recommended within the context of a clinical trial. Importantly, robust data have already supported the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated-WBI schedules that should now replace standard fractionated-WBI as gold standard for all patients irrespective of their age. Finally, organs-at-risk sparing systems as strategy for prevention of radiation-related long-term toxicities should be strongly considered for these patients. Considering the lack of inclusion of young patients in several published trials as well as in some of the ongoing ones, robust evidence to counsel young breast cancer patients on the optimal radiation therapy approach is still lacking. Further studies and ad hoc subgroup analyses in this specific patient population are strongly warranted.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tamoxifen administered for 5 years at 20 mg/d is effective in breast cancer treatment and prevention, but toxicity has limited its broad use. Biomarker trials showed that 5 mg/d is not inferior to 20 mg/d in decreasing breast cancer proliferation. We hypothesized that a lower dose given for a shorter period could be as effective in preventing recurrence from breast intraepithelial neoplasia but have a lower toxicity than the standard dose. Methods: We conducted a multicenter randomized trial of tamoxifen, 5 mg/d or placebo administered for 3 years after surgery in women with hormone-sensitive or unknown breast intraepithelial neoplasia, including atypical ductal hyperplasia and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ. The primary end point was the incidence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Results: Five hundred women 75 years of age or younger were included. After a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 3.9-6.3 years), there were 14 neoplastic events with tamoxifen and 28 with placebo (11.6   23.9 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.92;   = .02), which resulted in a 5-year number needed to treat of 22 (95% CI, 20 to 27). Tamoxifen decreased contralateral breast events by 75% (three   12 events; hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88;   = .02). Patient-reported outcomes were not different between arms except for a slight increase in frequency of daily hot flashes with tamoxifen (  = .02). There were 12 serious adverse events with tamoxifen and 16 with placebo, including one deep vein thrombosis and one stage I endometrial cancer with tamoxifen and one pulmonary embolism with placebo. Conclusion: Tamoxifen at 5 mg/d for 3 years can halve the recurrence of breast intraepithelial neoplasia with a limited toxicity, which provides a new treatment option in these disorders.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although it is widely accepted that hormone receptor (HR) status is associated with later post-diagnostic periods, a debate exists as to whether the association is independent of age. The aim of our study was to confirm the impact of HR status on later period breast cancer-specific death (LP-BCSD) and later period non-breast cancer-specific death (LP-non-BCSD) in different age subgroups. Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results databases were utilized to identify 181,108 breast cancer patients with > 5 years survival. The cumulative incidence of LP-BCSD and LP-non-BCSD was calculated using the Gray method. The subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) of variables was estimated via the Fine and Gray proportional hazard regression model. Subgroup analyses for LP-BCSD and LP-non-BCSD were performed according to the HR status. Results: The risk of LP-BCSD was exceeded by that of LP-non-BCSD at > 5 years since the diagnosis, particularly in old women. The competing risk regression model indicated that hormone receptor-positive (HR+) was an independent factor for more LP-BCSD (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.54;   < 0.001). However, stratified analysis indicated that HR+ was only associated with more LP-BCSD in the young women subgroup. Although HR+ was associated with more LP-non-BCSD, the predictive value of HR+ for LP-non-BCSD was eliminated after adjusting for age. Conclusion: HR+ was related to LP-BCSD in the premenopausal population. LP-BCSD should be an optimal endpoint in future trials designed to evaluate the role of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy.",

Methods: We included 365 women who were diagnosed with T1N0M0 BC between 2003 and 2016, and who received surgery at our center. They were classified as younger (≤40 years) and older (>40 years). We used PSM to balance clinicopathologic characteristics between the two age groups. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, before and after PSM. Results: Over a median follow-up period of 79 months, 54 patients developed recurrences. Before PSM, younger patients had worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) than older patients. Significantly worse RFS was seen in younger patients with HER2  BC compared with their older counterparts. Younger patients had higher rates of locoregional recurrence rather than metastasis, especially in the first 5 years after diagnosis. After PSM, the two age groups still significantly differed in 5-year RFS. Conclusion: Among PSM pairs with T1N0M0 BC, with equal baselines and treatment conditions, we found that patients who presented at younger ages had worse outcomes, independently of other pathological features. Younger patients with BC may require more individualized therapy to improve their prognosis.",

Methods: Patients with pT1 to pT4c, all pN+, and pN0/high-risk EBC were eligible. High-risk pN0 was defined by one or more of the following: pT greater than 2, grade 2 to 3, high urokinase-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, hormone receptor (HR) negativity, and less than 35 years of age. After an early amendment, all HR-positive tumors underwent recurrence score (RS) testing, with chemotherapy omission recommended in RS less than or equal to 11 pN0 to pN1 disease. Patients were randomly assigned to four cycles of epirubicin (E) /cyclophoshamide (C)  followed by four cycles of docetaxel (T)  or six cycles of T C  (administered once every 3 weeks). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and safety. The protocol specified P = .05 for a noninferiority margin of 4.4% for all patients combined. Results: Of the 3,198 registered patients, 348 (RS ≤ 11) omitted chemotherapy, and 401 were not randomly assigned. The intention-to-treat population included 2,449 patients (1,227 EC-T v 1,222 TC: postmenopausal, 62.2% v 60.8%; pN0, 58.2% v 59.5%; pT1, 57.6% v 52.3%; HR positive, 81.4% v 82.2%; RS greater than 25 [in HR-positive patients], 26.2% v 27.5%). Within the safety population (1,167 v 1,178 patients), 87.5% v 93.0% completed therapy. After a 60-month median follow-up, 5-year outcomes were similar in the EC-T and TC arms (DFS, 89.6% [95% CI, 87.9% to 91.5%] v 89.9% [95% CI, 88.1% to 91.8%]; OS, 94.5% [95% CI, 93.1% to 95.9%] v 94.7% [95% CI, 93.3% to 96.1%]). The DFS difference was within the noninferiority margin of the original trial design. Five treatment-related deaths were reported for TC (one for EC-T), despite a trend toward more-severe adverse events in the latter. Interaction analysis revealed no predictive trends with respect to key factors, including triple-negative, luminal A/B-like, pN, age, and RS status. Conclusion: In the West German Study Group PlanB trial, 5-year outcomes for TC and EC-T were equally excellent. Six cycles of TC is an effective/safe option in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative EBC with pN0 high genomic risk or pN1 EBC with genomically intermediate- to high-risk disease.",

Methods: Hormone receptor-positive, premenopausal, lymph node-positive, or tumor size ≥4 cm breast cancer patients who had received tamoxifen for 2-3 years were randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen treatment (TAM group) or switch to adjuvant anastrozole plus goserelin (ADD group) and continue treatment for another 2-3 years (total treatment duration 5 years). Endpoints evaluated were adverse events (AEs), changes in bone mineral density, quality of life, and disease-free survival-related events. Results: A total of 62 patients (33 in the ADD group and 29 in the TAM group) were evaluated. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs occurred in five patients (15.2%) in the ADD group vs none in the TAM group. In the ADD group, arthralgias were the most common AEs (5/33 patients; 15.2%), and three patients in this group were discontinued because of AEs. Treatment was temporarily suspended due to AEs in three patients (9.1%) in the ADD group and one patient (3.4%) in the TAM group. Compared with continuing TAM therapy, switching to anastrozole plus goserelin did not result in any worsening of bone mineral density or quality of life. During a median follow-up of 34 months, five patients (15.2%) in the ADD group had disease-free survival events vs four patients (13.8%) in the TAM group. Conclusion: For early-stage breast cancer patients who remain premenopausal following 2-3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, switching to anastrozole plus goserelin therapy was safe with tolerable adverse effects. However, it did not show superior efficacy compared to remaining on tamoxifen treatment.",

Patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure (CIOFF) were also eligible, but could be at risk of ovarian function recovery (OFR). The current analysis compared the survival of women with CIOFF with definitely postmenopausal women and examined the influence of OFR on survival. Therefore, we selected patients from the DATA study aged 45-57 years at randomization who had received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. They were classified by reversibility of postmenopausal status: possibly reversible in case of CIOFF (n = 395) versus definitely postmenopausal (n = 261). The former were monitored by E2 measurements for OFR. The occurrence of OFR was incorporated as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox-regression model for calculating the hazard ratio (HR). We used the landmark method to calculate residual 5-year survival rates. When comparing CIOFF women with definitely postmenopausal women, the survival was not different. Among CIOFF women with available E2 follow-up values (n = 329), experiencing OFR (n = 39) had an unfavorable impact on distant recurrence-free survival (HR 2.27 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-5.25; p = 0.05] and overall survival (HR 2.61 [95% CI 1.11-6.13; p = 0.03]). After adjusting for tumor features, the HRs became 2.11 (95% CI 0.89-5.02; p = 0.09) and 2.24 (95% CI 0.92-5.45; p = 0.07), respectively. The residual 5-year rate for distant recurrence-free survival was 76.9% for women with OFR and 92.1% for women without OFR, and for 5-year overall survival 80.8% and 94.4%, respectively. Women with CIOFF receiving anastrozole may be at increased risk of disease recurrence if experiencing OFR.",

Current testing guidelines for germ line susceptibility genes in patients with breast carcinoma were developed to identify carriers of BRCA1/ 2 variants and have evolved in the panel-testing era. We evaluated the capability of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to identify patients with breast cancer with pathogenic variants in expanded panel testing. Methods: An institutional review board-approved multicenter prospective registry was initiated with 20 community and academic sites experienced in cancer genetic testing and counseling. Eligibility criteria included patients with a previously or newly diagnosed breast cancer who had not undergone either single- or multigene testing. Consecutive patients 18 to 90 years of age were consented and underwent an 80-gene panel test. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant electronic case report forms collected information on patient demographics, diagnoses, phenotypes, and test results. Results: More than 1,000 patients were enrolled, and data records for 959 patients were analyzed; 49.95% met NCCN criteria, and 50.05% did not. Overall, 8.65% of patients had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. Of patients who met NCCN guidelines with test results, 9.39% had a P/LP variant. Of patients who did not meet guidelines, 7.9% had a P/LP variant. The difference in positive results between these groups was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test P = .4241). Conclusion: Our results indicate that nearly half of patients with breast cancer with a P/LP variant with clinically actionable and/or management guidelines in development are missed by current testing guidelines. We recommend that all patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer undergo expanded panel testing.",

Many who are prescribed AET do not adhere adequately. Studies have sought to examine the effects of interventions to enhance patients' AET adherence, with strikingly mixed results. In order to reconcile a disparate literature, this paper aims to (1) quantitatively review the aggregate effect of interventions designed to optimize AET adherence within the current literature and (2) meta-analyze these effects across studies' by intervention design. Methods: Duplicate searches were conducted using multiple electronic databases as well as hand searches of recent year conference abstracts. Studies were included that (1) tested an intervention to promote AET adherence; (2) reported at least one measure of medication adherence; and (3) reported (or provided upon request) data sufficient to calculate effect size. Effect sizes were calculated using random effects models. Results: Seven studies representing eight unique interventions were included. We observed an overall null effect across all interventions (k = 8; d [95% CI] = 0.28 [-0.05, 0.61]); however, sensitivity analyses showed that interventions that used bi-directional communication showed statistically significant effects relative to control groups within each study (k = 4; d [95% CI] = 0.59 [0.23, 0.95]) while those relying only on providing information to the patient (one-way communication) did not (k = 4; d [95% CI] = -0.03 [-0.27, 0.20]). Conclusion: Interventions that promote patient self-report may improve AET adherence through enhancing patient engagement.

        "abstract": "Background: Previous studies reported increasing rates of metastatic breast cancer among young US women. However, these studies were based on limited geographic areas and did not account for the sharp decline in unknown-stage disease. In this study, we examined trends in early-onset breast cancer incidence rates by stage at diagnosis in a national dataset, after correcting for temporal changes in unstaged disease. Methods: Using data from 42 states, covering 82% of the US population, we examined trends in incidence rates by stage at diagnosis and race/ethnicity in women ages 20-39 years. Stage was imputed for non-Hispanic (NH) white and NH black cases with missing information by distributing cases proportionally according to survival statistics. Results: During 2001-2015, incidence rates of early-onset metastatic breast cancer increased sharply among NH white, NH black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women. Increasing trends were also observed for local-stage disease (all racial/ethnic groups) and regional-stage disease (NH white and API). In contrast, rates decreased sharply for unstaged disease among all groups. After imputing stage for cases with missing information, the increasing trends for regional- and distant-stage disease in NH whites and local-stage disease in NH blacks were no longer statistically significant, but the increase in distant-stage disease in NH blacks was unchanged. Conclusion: After accounting for the sharp decline in unstaged cases, the increase in incidence rates for distant-stage disease became non-significant in NH whites but not in NH blacks. Future studies should consider accounting for temporal changes in unstaged disease when examining stage-specific incidence trends.",

BPs have no teratogenic effect on the 36 analyzed pregnancies compared to unexposed controls matched on women underlying diseases (either systemic disease, either \"bone\" disease) but some outcome differed: neonatal complications rate in systemic diseases and live birth rate in bone diseases). Methods: The effect of bisphosphonates (BPs) during pregnancy remains unclear. We aimed to study pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to BPs during pregnancy. Results: Data for cases and controls were from the French Reference Centre of Teratogenic Agents. Cases were women who received BPs in the 6 weeks before or during a pregnancy and had systemic or bone diseases. We included two respectively matched control groups: women with systemic diseases not exposed to BPs and healthy women not exposed to BPs or any teratogenic agent. Four controls were assigned to each case. Conclusion: Thirty-six women were exposed to BPs including 5 just before pregnancy and 30 during the first trimester; 23 had systemic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, n = 5; rheumatoid arthritis, n = 5; other, n = 13) and 13 had bone diseases. Rate of observed congenital malformations did not differ in women with a systemic or a bone disease compared to their respective controls (respectively 2/23 [8.7%] vs 2/92 [2.2%], p = 0.178 and 0/13 [0%] vs 0/52 [0%], p = 1.00). Among women with systemic diseases, non-specific neonatal complications were more frequent for cases (4/16 [25.0%] vs 4/64 [6.3%], p = 0.027). Among women with bone disorders, the live birth rate was lower for cases than healthy controls (8/10 [80%] vs 50/50 [100%], p = 0.025).",

        "abstract": "Background: This article summarises the information that should be provided to women and referring physicians about breast ultrasound (US). After explaining the physical principles, technical procedure and safety of US, information is given about its ability to make a correct diagnosis, depending on the setting in which it is applied. The following definite indications for breast US in female subjects are proposed: palpable lump; axillary adenopathy; first diagnostic approach for clinical abnormalities under 40 and in pregnant or lactating women; suspicious abnormalities at mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); suspicious nipple discharge; recent nipple inversion; skin retraction; breast inflammation; abnormalities in the area of the surgical scar after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy; abnormalities in the presence of breast implants; screening high-risk women, especially when MRI is not performed; loco-regional staging of a known breast cancer, when MRI is not performed; guidance for percutaneous interventions (needle biopsy, pre-surgical localisation, fluid collection drainage); monitoring patients with breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant therapy, when MRI is not performed. Possible indications such as supplemental screening after mammography for women aged 40-74 with dense breasts are also listed. Moreover, inappropriate indications include screening for breast cancer as a stand-alone alternative to mammography. The structure and organisation of the breast US report and of classification systems such as the BI-RADS and consequent management recommendations are illustrated. Information about additional or new US technologies (colour-Doppler, elastography, and automated whole breast US) is also provided. Finally, five frequently asked questions are answered. Methods: • US is an established tool for suspected cancers at all ages and also the method of choice under 40. • For US-visible suspicious lesions, US-guided biopsy is preferred, even for palpable findings. • High-risk women can be screened with US, especially when MRI cannot be performed. • Supplemental US increases cancer detection but also false positives, biopsy rate and follow-up exams. • Breast US is inappropriate as a stand-alone screening method.",

        "abstract": "Background: Poor breast cancer survival in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) can be attributed to advanced-stage presentation and poor access to systemic therapy. We aimed to estimate the outcomes of different early detection strategies in combination with systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in LMICs. Methods: We adapted a microsimulation model to project outcomes of three early detection strategies alone or in combination with three systemic treatment programmes beyond standard of care (programme A): programme B was endocrine therapy for all oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive cases; programme C was programme B plus chemotherapy for ER-negative cases; programme D was programme C plus chemotherapy for advanced ER-positive cases. The main outcomes were reductions in breast cancer-related mortality and lives saved per 100 000 women relative to the standard of care for women aged 30-49 years in a low-income setting (East Africa; using incidence data and life tables from Uganda and data on tumour characteristics from various East African countries) and for women aged 50-69 years in a middle-income setting (Colombia). Results: In the East African setting, relative mortality reductions were 8-41%, corresponding to 23 (95% uncertainty interval -12 to 49) to 114 (80 to 138) lives saved per 100 000 women over 10 years. In Colombia, mortality reductions were 7-25%, corresponding to 32 (-29 to 70) to 105 (61 to 141) lives saved per 100 000 women over 10 years. Conclusion: The best projected outcomes were in settings where access to both early detection and adjuvant therapy is improved. Even in the absence of mammographic screening, improvements in detection can provide substantial benefit in settings where advanced-stage presentation is common.",

        "abstract": "Background: Despite the availability of different strategies for ovarian function and/or fertility preservation in young breast cancer patients candidates for chemotherapy, limited data are available on patients' actual need of these options. Methods: The PREFER study is a prospective cohort study including premenopausal women with newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer between the age of 18 and 45 years and candidates for chemotherapy. The study aimed to investigate patients' preferences and their choices of the different available strategies for ovarian function and/or fertility preservation (i.e. acceptance rate) and reasons for refusal. Results: A total of 131 consecutive patients referred from a single breast unit were included. Median age was 38.9 years with 92 patients (70.3%) diagnosed at ≤ 40 years. The majority of patients (122, 93.1%) were concerned about the risk of treatment-induced premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and/or infertility. A total of 120 (91.6%) patients underwent temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists during chemotherapy for ovarian function preservation. Among patients with ≤40 years, only 11 (12.0%) decided to access cryopreservation strategies for fertility preservation. The main reason for not accessing the fertility unit was completion of family planning before breast cancer diagnosis; for patients who accessed the fertility unit, fear of the procedure was the main reason to refuse the proposed cryopreservation strategies. Conclusion: Despite the majority of young breast cancer patients are concerned about the risk of treatment-induced POI and/or infertility, only a limited number of them required to access the fertility unit to undergo cryopreservation strategies.",

        "abstract": "Background: This study evaluated predictive factors for recovery of ovarian function after ovarian protection by GnRH agonist during chemotherapy in young breast cancer patients. Methods: This prospective cohort study analyzed 105 young breast cancer patients who were studied longitudinally after receiving GnRH agonist during cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for ovarian protection. Associations between pretreatment hormones, clinical factors, and recovery of ovarian function (resumption of menstruation or anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) ≥ 1 ng/ml) were evaluated at 12 months and long-term follow-up after completion of chemotherapy. Results: Mean age was 32 years (range 23-42 years). In multivariate analyses, tamoxifen use (P = 0.035) and pretreatment follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (P = 0.032) were predictive of resumption of menstruation, and age (P = 0.019), tamoxifen use (P = 0.022), pretreatment FSH (P < 0.001), and AMH (P = 0.040) were predictors for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml at 12 months. In addition, pretreatment AMH was a predictor for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml after long-term follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses gave area under the curve of 0.805 for resumption of menstruation and 0.903 for serum AMH concentration ≥ 1 ng/ml at 12 months, when age, tamoxifen use, pretreatment FSH, and AMH were combined. Conclusion: Pretreatment AMH (3.26 ng/ml), age (33.9 years), pretreatment FSH (5.5 IU/l), and tamoxifen use are useful predictors for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml at 12 months after GnRH agonist. This finding will support patient and clinician decision-making regarding fertility preservation.",

ASCO considered the guideline for endorsement. Methods The SIO guideline addressed the use of integrative therapies for the management of symptoms and adverse effects, such as anxiety and stress, mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Interventions of interest included mind and body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications. SIO systematic reviews focused on randomized controlled trials that were published from 1990 through 2015. The SIO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations in the SIO guideline-published in 2017-are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline with a few added discussion points. Recommendations Key recommendations include the following: Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-l-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because of a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related adverse effects.

The addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not result in significantly lower recurrence rates than those with tamoxifen alone. Here, we report the updated results from the two trials. Methods: Premenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive 5 years of tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, or exemestane plus ovarian suppression in SOFT and to receive tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression or exemestane plus ovarian suppression in TEXT. Randomization was stratified according to the receipt of chemotherapy. Results: In SOFT, the 8-year disease-free survival rate was 78.9% with tamoxifen alone, 83.2% with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 85.9% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.009 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression). The 8-year rate of overall survival was 91.5% with tamoxifen alone, 93.3% with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 92.1% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.01 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression); among the women who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy, the rates were 85.1%, 89.4%, and 87.2%, respectively. Among the women with cancers that were negative for HER2 who received chemotherapy, the 8-year rate of distant recurrence with exemestane plus ovarian suppression was lower than the rate with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression (by 7.0 percentage points in SOFT and by 5.0 percentage points in TEXT). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 24.6% of the tamoxifen-alone group, 31.0% of the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group, and 32.3% of the exemestane-ovarian suppression group. Conclusion: Among premenopausal women with breast cancer, the addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen resulted in significantly higher 8-year rates of both disease-free and overall survival than tamoxifen alone. The use of exemestane plus ovarian suppression resulted in even higher rates of freedom from recurrence. The frequency of adverse events was higher in the two groups that received ovarian suppression than in the tamoxifen-alone group.

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose The role of temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) during chemotherapy as a strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis using individual patient-level data was conducted to better assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy in patients with early breast cancer. Methods The trials in which premenopausal women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa were eligible for inclusion. Primary end points were premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) rate and post-treatment pregnancy rate. Disease-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points. Because each study represents a cluster, statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Results A total of 873 patients from five trials were included. POI rate was 14.1% in the GnRHa group and 30.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; P < .001). A total of 37 (10.3%) patients had at least one post-treatment pregnancy in the GnRHa group and 20 (5.5%) in the control group (incidence rate ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.15; P = .030). No significant differences in disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.42; P = .999) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.06; P = .083) were observed between groups. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of temporary ovarian suppression with GnRHa during chemotherapy as an available option to reduce the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced POI and potentially improve future fertility in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are given as adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, also to those with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure. The current analysis reports on endocrine data of patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure who were included in the phase III DATA study assessing different durations of adjuvant anastrozole after tamoxifen. Methods: We identified all patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure. Women who underwent a bilateral ovariectomy or used luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists before random assignment were excluded. Plasma estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were monitored until 30 months after random assignment at local laboratories. We aimed to determine the ovarian function recovery (OFR) rate during AI use by the cumulative incidence competing risk method and analyzed the trend of estradiol levels during AI use by a nested case-control approach in which a subset of control subjects were compared with the OFR patients excluding the value at OFR diagnosis. Results: The 329 eligible patients had a median age of 50.0 years (range = 45-57 years) at random assignment. Thirty-nine patients developed OFR, corresponding with a 30-month recovery rate of 12.4%. Of these, 11 (28.2%) were age 50 years or older at AI initiation. The estradiol level decreased statistically significantly by 37.8% (95% CI = 27.4% to 46.7%) over the initial 30 months of AI treatment in both groups. However, the estradiol levels in the women who experienced OFR remained statistically significantly higher (difference = 20.6%, 95% CI = 2.0% to 42.7%) prior to OFR diagnosis compared with those who did not experience OFR. Conclusion: The risk of OFR during AI treatment in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure is relevant, even beyond 45 years. Furthermore, women experiencing OFR had statistically significant higher estradiol levels during AI treatment (before OFR) than those without, with potential consequences regarding efficacy.",

The Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for LOcally Recurrent breast cancer (CALOR) trial investigated the effectiveness of chemotherapy (CT) after local therapy for ILRR. A report at 5 years of median follow-up showed significant benefit of CT for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative ILRR, but additional follow-up was required in ER-positive ILRR. Patients and Methods CALOR was an open-label, randomized trial for patients with completely excised ILRR after unilateral breast cancer. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive CT or no CT and stratified by prior CT, hormone receptor status, and location of ILRR. Patients with hormone receptor-positive ILRR received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Radiation therapy was mandated for patients with microscopically involved margins, and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy was optional. End points were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival, and breast cancer-free interval. Results From August 2003 to January 2010, 162 patients were enrolled: 58 with ER-negative and 104 with ER-positive ILRR. At 9 years of median follow-up, 27 DFS events were observed in the ER-negative group and 40 in the ER-positive group. The hazard ratios (HR) of a DFS event were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67; 10-year DFS, 70% v 34%, CT v no CT, respectively) in patients with ER-negative ILRR and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.57 to 2.00; 10-year DFS, 50% v 59%, respectively) in patients with ER-positive ILRR ( P  = .013). HRs were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.85), respectively, for breast cancer-free interval ( P  = .034) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.19 to 1.20) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.55), respectively, for overall survival ( P  = .53). Results for the three end points were consistent in multivariable analyses adjusting for location of ILRR, prior CT, and interval from primary surgery. Conclusion The final analysis of CALOR confirms that CT benefits patients with resected ER-negative ILRR and does not support the use of CT for ER-positive ILRR.",

This review examines the available data on the margin status for invasive breast cancer and DCIS, and highlights the similarities and differences in tumor biology and standard treatments that affect the local recurrence (LR) risk and, therefore, the optimal surgical margin. Consensus guidelines support a negative margin, defined as no ink on tumor, for invasive carcinoma treated with breast-conserving therapy. Because of differences in the growth pattern and utilization of systemic therapy, a margin of 2 mm has been found to minimize the LR risk for women with DCIS undergoing lumpectomy and radiation therapy (RT). Wider negative margins do not improve local control for DCIS or invasive carcinoma when they are treated with lumpectomy and RT. Re-excision for negative margins should be individualized, and the routine practice of performing additional surgery to obtain a wider negative margin is not supported by the literature.

The menstrual resumption period and survivals were the secondary endpoints. Results: The median follow-up time was 56.9 months (IQR 49.5-72.4 months). One hundred and eight patients were enrolled in each group. Among them, 92 and 78 patients had complete primary endpoint data in the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively. The rates of early menopause were 22.8% (21/92) in the sequential group and 23.1% (18/78) in the simultaneous group [simultaneous vs. sequential: OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.50-2.08); p = 0.969; age-adjusted OR 1.13; (95% CI 0.54-2.37); p = 0.737]. The median menstruation resumption period was 12.0 (95% CI 9.3-14.7) months and 10.3 (95% CI 8.2-12.4) months for the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59-1.16); p = 0.274; age-adjusted HR 0.90 (95%CI 0.64-1.27); p = 0.567]. No significant differences were evident for disease-free survival (p = 0.290) or overall survival (p = 0.514) between the two groups. Conclusion: For ER-positive premenopausal patients, the sequential use of GnRHa and chemotherapy showed ovarian preservation and survival outcomes that were no worse than simultaneous use. The application of GnRHa can probably be delayed until menstruation resumption after chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Nonadherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy has been poorly studied in Asian patients with breast cancer. We therefore assessed adherence to endocrine therapy among women with breast cancer in Japan. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study among Japanese women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Patients brought their pill packets to visits for 1 year and answered a questionnaire. We also examined prescription records during the study period. Adherence to endocrine therapy was defined as patients who had taken > 80% of the pills according to the packets during the study. Clinicopathologic features and questionnaires were compared between adherent and nonadherent patients. Results: A total of 234 patients completed the trial, of whom 85% demonstrated adherence based on pill packets, and 98% demonstrated adherence based on prescription records. Mastectomy, higher stage, nodal metastasis and adjuvant chemotherapy were correlated with adherence based on pill packets. Adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent factor associated with adherence. According to the questionnaire, adherent patients were more likely to consult a nurse when they had trouble with their medication. These patients also emphasized the efficacy rather than the side effects of the medication. Nonadherent patients were aware that they were being nonadherent. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that 85% of patients were adherent to endocrine therapy, but physicians were unaware of the nonadherent patients. Raised awareness of nonadherence and information sharing between patients and medical teams might increase adherence to endocrine therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Chemotherapy results in permanent loss of ovarian function in some premenopausal women. Accurate identification in women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer (eBC) would allow optimisation of subsequent endocrine treatment. We sought to assess whether analysis of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) using a sensitive automated assay could identify women who would not regain ovarian function after chemotherapy. Methods: Data from women in the Ovarian Protection Trial in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients (OPTION) trial of goserelin (a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue) for ovarian protection were analysed. Women were assessed for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI: amenorrhoea with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) at 24 months after diagnosis. The accuracy of AMH for the diagnosis of POI and its prediction from measurement at the end of chemotherapy was calculated. Results: AMH below the level of detection showed good diagnostic accuracy for POI at 24 months (n = 73) with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve of 0.86, sensitivity 1.0 and specificity 0.73 at the assay limit of detection. In women aged >40 at diagnosis who did not receive goserelin, AMH measured at end of chemotherapy also gave good prediction of POI at 24 months (area under the curve (AUC) 0.89 95% CI 0.75-1.0, n = 32), with sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.82, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 42.8. FSH gave slightly lower AUC, and specificity was low at 0.55. Age but not tamoxifen impacted on AMH levels. Conclusion: Using this sensitive AMH assay, the finding of an undetectable AMH level in women aged >40 at the end of chemotherapy for eBC gave a good prediction that ovarian function would not return. This may allow alterations in post-chemotherapy endocrine management.",

        "abstract": "Background: The administration of endocrine therapy for 5 years substantially reduces recurrence rates during and after treatment in women with early-stage, estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Extending such therapy beyond 5 years offers further protection but has additional side effects. Obtaining data on the absolute risk of subsequent distant recurrence if therapy stops at 5 years could help determine whether to extend treatment. Methods: In this meta-analysis of the results of 88 trials involving 62,923 women with ER-positive breast cancer who were disease-free after 5 years of scheduled endocrine therapy, we used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, stratified according to trial and treatment, to assess the associations of tumor diameter and nodal status (TN), tumor grade, and other factors with patients' outcomes during the period from 5 to 20 years. Results: Breast-cancer recurrences occurred at a steady rate throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status. Among the patients with stage T1 disease, the risk of distant recurrence was 13% with no nodal involvement (T1N0), 20% with one to three nodes involved (T1N1-3), and 34% with four to nine nodes involved (T1N4-9); among those with stage T2 disease, the risks were 19% with T2N0, 26% with T2N1-3, and 41% with T2N4-9. The risk of death from breast cancer was similarly dependent on TN status, but the risk of contralateral breast cancer was not. Given the TN status, the factors of tumor grade (available in 43,590 patients) and Ki-67 status (available in 7692 patients), which are strongly correlated with each other, were of only moderate independent predictive value for distant recurrence, but the status regarding the progesterone receptor (in 54,115 patients) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) (in 15,418 patients in trials with no use of trastuzumab) was not predictive. During the study period from 5 to 20 years, the absolute risk of distant recurrence among patients with T1N0 breast cancer was 10% for low-grade disease, 13% for moderate-grade disease, and 17% for high-grade disease; the corresponding risks of any recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer were 17%, 22%, and 26%, respectively. Conclusion: After 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, breast-cancer recurrences continued to occur steadily throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status, with risks ranging from 10 to 41%, depending on TN status and tumor grade.

The impact of the timing of PMRT to a tissue expander or permanent implant is not well understood. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate outcomes in implant-based reconstruction and the timing of PMRT. Methods: A review of the English literature in the PubMed/MEDLINE database (2000-2016) was performed to identify all articles on implant-based breast reconstruction and PMRT. Cases from each study were grouped by PMRT to a tissue expander or PMRT to a permanent implant. Outcomes of interest included reconstructive failure and capsular contracture as overall rates and associations were pooled. Effect sizes (z values), risk ratios (RRs), and heterogeneity scores (I ) were calculated on meta-analysis. Results: There were 20 studies meeting inclusion criteria with 2348 patients identified. Pooled analysis revealed an overall rate of reconstructive failure of 17.6% and Baker grade III/IV capsular contracture of 37.5%. PMRT applied to tissue expanders resulted in higher rates of reconstructive failure compared with PMRT applied to permanent silicone implants (20% versus 13.4%, RR = 2.33, P = 0.0083, 95% confidence interval 1.24-4.35), but lower rates of capsular contracture (24.5% versus 49.4%, RR = 0.53, P = 0.083, 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.09). Conclusion: Regardless of timing, PMRT applied to implant-based breast reconstruction was associated with high risk of reconstructive failure and capsular contracture. Surgeons should consider alternative strategies, such as autologous tissue reconstructions, in patients requiring PMRT.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recent breast cancer treatment guidelines recommend that higher-risk premenopausal patients should receive ovarian function suppression (OFS) as part of adjuvant endocrine therapy. If chemotherapy is also given, it is uncertain whether to select concurrent or sequential OFS initiation. Methods: We analyzed 1872 patients enrolled in the randomized phase III TEXT and SOFT trials who received adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and upon randomization to an OFS-containing adjuvant endocrine therapy, initiated gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonist triptorelin. Breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was compared between patients who received OFS concurrently with chemotherapy in TEXT (n = 1242) versus sequentially post-chemotherapy in SOFT (n = 630). Because timing of trial enrollment relative to adjuvant chemotherapy differed, we implemented landmark analysis re-defining BCFI beginning 1 year after final dose of chemotherapy (median, 15.5 and 8.1 months from enrollment to landmark in TEXT and SOFT, respectively). As a non-randomized treatment comparison, we implemented comparative-effectiveness propensity score methodology with weighted Cox modeling. Results: Distributions of several clinico-pathologic characteristics differed between groups. Patients who were premenopausal post-chemotherapy in SOFT were younger on average. The median duration of adjuvant chemotherapy was 18 weeks in both groups. There were 231 (12%) BC events after post-landmark median follow-up of about 5 years. Concurrent use of triptorelin with chemotherapy was not associated with a significant difference in post-landmark BCFI compared with sequential triptorelin post-chemotherapy, either in the overall population (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.72-1.72; P = 0.72; 4-year BCFI 89% in both groups), or in the subgroup of 692 women <40 years at diagnosis (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.69-1.84) who are less likely to develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Conclusion: Based on comparative-effectiveness modeling of TEXT and SOFT after about 5 years median follow-up, with limited statistical power especially for the subgroup <40 years, neither detrimental nor beneficial effect of concurrent administration of OFS with chemotherapy on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy that includes chemotherapy was detected.",

        "abstract": "Background: Skin-sparing (SSM) and nipple-sparing (NSM) mastectomies are relatively new conservative surgical approaches to breast cancer. In SSM most of the breast skin is conserved to create a pocket that facilitates immediate breast reconstruction with implant or autologous graft to achieve a quality cosmetic outcome. NSM is closely similar except that the nipple-areola complex (NAC) is also conserved. Meta-analyses indicate that outcomes for SSM and NSM do not differ from those for non-conservative mastectomies. Recurrence rates in the NAC after NSM are acceptably low (0-3.7%). Other studies indicate that NSM is associated with high patient satisfaction and good psychological adjustment. Indications are carcinoma or DCIS that require mastectomy (including after neoadjuvant chemotherapy). NSM is also suitable for women undergoing risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy. Tumor not less than 2 cm from the NAC is recommended, but may be less important than no evidence of nipple involvement on mandatory intraoperative nipple margin assessment. A positive margin is an absolute contraindication for nipple preservation. Other contraindications are microcalcifications close to the subareolar region and a positive nipple discharge. Complication rates are similar to those for other types of post-mastectomy reconstructions. The main complication of NSM is NAC necrosis, however as surgeon experience matures, frequency declines. Factors associated with complications are voluminous breast, ptosis, smoking, obesity, and radiotherapy. Since the access incision is small, breast tissue may be left behind, so only experienced breast surgeons should do these operations in close collaboration with the plastic surgeon. For breast cancer patients requiring mastectomy, NSM should be the option of choice.",

Methods In SOFT, women still premenopausal after surgery with or without chemotherapy were randomly assigned to tamoxifen alone, tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS), or exemestane plus OFS. In TEXT, all received OFS with or without concomitant chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. We summarize treatment efficacy, quality of life, and adherence of the cohort of women younger than 35 years in SOFT and TEXT, alongside data from the cohort of older premenopausal women. Results For 240 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative patients younger than 35 years enrolled in SOFT after receiving chemotherapy, the 5-year breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was 67.1% (95% CI, 54.6% to 76.9%) with tamoxifen alone, 75.9% with tamoxifen plus OFS (95% CI, 64.0% to 84.4%), and 83.2% with exemestane plus OFS (95% CI, 72.7% to 90.0%). For 145 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative patients younger than 35 years in TEXT, 5-year BCFI was 79.2% (95% CI, 66.2% to 87.7%) with tamoxifen plus OFS and 81.6% (95% CI, 69.8% to 89.2%) with exemestane plus OFS. The most prominent quality of life symptom for patients younger than 35 years receiving OFS was vasomotor symptoms, with the greatest worsening from baseline at 6 months (on the order of 30 to 40 points), but loss of sexual interest and difficulties in becoming aroused were also clinically meaningful (≥ 8-point change). The level of symptom burden was similar in older premenopausal women. A total of 19.8% of women younger than 35 years stopped all protocol-assigned endocrine therapy early. Conclusion In women younger than 35 years with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, adjuvant OFS combined with tamoxifen or exemestane produces large improvements in BCFI compared with tamoxifen alone. Menopausal symptoms are significant but are not worse than those seen in older premenopausal women.",

This meta-analysis examines the association between pre-operative MRI and surgical outcomes in BC. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify studies reporting quantitative data on pre-operative MRI and surgical outcomes (without restriction by type of surgery received or type of BC) and using a controlled design. Random-effects logistic regression calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) for each surgical outcome (MRI vs. no-MRI groups), and estimated ORs stratified by study-level age. Subgroup analysis was performed for invasive lobular cancer (ILC). Results: Nineteen studies met eligibility criteria: 3 RCTs and 16 comparative studies that included newly diagnosed BC of any type except for three studies restricted to ILC. Primary analysis (85,975 subjects) showed that pre-operative MRI was associated with increased odds of receiving mastectomy [OR 1.39 (1.23, 1.57); p < 0.001]; similar findings were shown in analyses stratified by study-level median age. Secondary analyses did not find statistical evidence of an effect of MRI on the rates of re-excision, re-operation, or positive margins; however, MRI was significantly associated with increased odds of receiving contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [OR 1.91 (1.25, 2.91); p = 0.003]. Subgroup analysis for ILC did not find any association between MRI and the odds of receiving mastectomy [OR 1.00 (0.75, 1.33); p = 0.988] or the odds of re-excision [OR 0.65 (0.35, 1.24); p = 0.192]. Conclusion: Pre-operative MRI is associated with increased odds of receiving ipsilateral mastectomy and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy as surgical treatment in newly diagnosed BC patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition caused by germline mutations of the   tumor suppressor gene encoding p53, a transcription factor triggered as a protective cellular mechanism against different stressors. Loss of p53 function renders affected individuals highly susceptible to a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers. It has recently become evident that children and adults with LFS benefit from intensive surveillance aimed at early tumor detection. In October 2016, the American Association for Cancer Research held a meeting of international LFS experts to evaluate the current knowledge on LFS and propose consensus surveillance recommendations. Herein, we briefly summarize clinical and genetic aspects of this aggressive cancer predisposition syndrome. In addition, the expert panel concludes that there are sufficient existing data to recommend that all patients with LFS be offered cancer surveillance as soon as the clinical or molecular LFS diagnosis is established. Specifically, the panel recommends adoption of a modified version of the \"Toronto protocol\" that includes a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging. The panel also recommends that further research be promoted to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of these risk-adapted surveillance and cancer prevention strategies while addressing the psychosocial needs of individuals and families with LFS.",

        "abstract": "Background: Chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) impacts fertility and other aspects of women's health. The OPTION trial tested whether administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist during chemotherapy for early breast cancer reduced the risk of POI. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, parallel group study of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist goserelin administered before and during chemotherapy for breast cancer with stage I-IIIB disease. The primary outcome was amenorrhoea between 12 and 24 months after randomization, supported by elevated follicle stimulating hormone concentrations to give an additional analysis as rate of POI. Results: A total of 227 patients were randomized and the primary analysis was conducted on 202 patients. Goserelin reduced the prevalence of amenorrhoea between 12 and 24 months to 22% versus 38% in the control group (P = 0.015) and the prevalence of POI to 18.5% versus 34.8% in the control group (P = 0.048). Follicle stimulating hormone concentrations were also lower in all women treated with goserelin at both 12 and 24 months (P = 0.027, P = 0.001, respectively). The effect of goserelin was not statistically significant in women >40 years. Assessment of the ovarian reserve using anti-Müllerian hormone showed a marked fall in both groups during treatment to median values of 5% of pretreatment levels in the control group and 7% in the goserelin group, which were not significantly different between groups. Conclusion: This study shows that goserelin reduced the risk of POI in women treated with chemotherapy for early breast cancer, with particular efficacy in women aged ≤40 years old. The degree of ovarian protection also seems limited and the clinical significance for fertility and longer term prevention of estrogen deficiency-related outcomes needs to be determined.",

Methods: We identified women diagnosed with unilateral stage I to III breast cancer between 1998 and 2012 within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. We compared characteristics and temporal trends between patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery, unilateral mastectomy, and CPM. We then performed Cox proportional-hazards regression to examine breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in women diagnosed between 1998 and 2007, who underwent breast-conserving surgery with radiation (breast-conserving therapy), unilateral mastectomy, or CPM, with subsequent subgroup analysis stratifying by age and HR status. Results: Of 496,488 women diagnosed with unilateral invasive breast cancer, 59.6% underwent breast-conserving surgery, 33.4% underwent unilateral mastectomy, and 7.0% underwent CPM. Overall, the proportion of women undergoing CPM increased from 3.9% in 2002 to 12.7% in 2012 (P < 0.001). Reconstructive surgery was performed in 48.3% of CPM patients compared with only 16.0% of unilateral mastectomy patients, with rates of reconstruction with CPM rising from 35.3% in 2002 to 55.4% in 2012 (P < 0.001). When compared with breast-conserving therapy, we found no significant improvement in BCSS or OS for women undergoing CPM (BCSS: HR 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; OS: HR 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.14), regardless of HR status or age. Conclusion: The use of CPM more than tripled during the study period despite evidence suggesting no survival benefit over breast conservation. Further examination on how to optimally counsel women about surgical options is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the United Kingdom, current screening guidelines for TP53 germline mutation carriers solely recommends annual breast MRI, despite the wide spectrum of malignancies typically seen in this group. This study sought to investigate the role of one-off non-contrast whole-body MRI (WB MRI) in the screening of asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers. 44 TP53 mutation carriers and 44 population controls were recruited. Scans were read by radiologists blinded to participant carrier status. The incidence of malignancies diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers against general population controls was calculated. The incidences of non-malignant relevant disease and irrelevant disease were measured, as well as the number of investigations required to determine relevance of findings. In TP53 mutation carriers, 6 of 44 (13.6, 95% CI 5.2-27.4%) participants were diagnosed with cancer during the study, all of which would be considered life threatening if untreated. Two were found to have two primary cancers. Two participants with cancer had abnormalities on the MRI which were initially thought to be benign (a pericardial cyst and a uterine fibroid) but transpired to be sarcomas. No controls were diagnosed with cancer. Fifteen carriers (34.1, 95% CI 20.5-49.9%) and seven controls (15.9, 95% CI 6.7-30.1%) underwent further investigations following the WB MRI for abnormalities that transpired to be benign (p = 0.049). The cancer detection rate in this group justifies a minimum baseline non-contrast WB MRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers. This should be adopted into national guidelines for management of adult TP53 mutation carriers in addition to the current practice of contrast enhanced breast MRI imaging.",

        "abstract": "Background: The outcome of advanced breast cancer has significantly improved over recent decades. As a consequence, the complex needs of patients living with the disease and their care-givers should be addressed not only in terms of supportive and palliative care but also of \"survivorship\" requirements. The multidisciplinary approach to advanced breast cancer should encompass - early in the history of the disease - not only physical but also functional, social, psychological and spiritual domains. It is important to clearly define the disease context with patients and families (\"chronic\" preferred to \"incurable\"), addressing the concept of uncertainty, and tailoring the treatment strategy according to both disease status and individual priorities. Specific psychosocial needs of young and elderly women and male patients - i.e. social security, job flexibility, rehabilitation (including sexuality), home and child care - should be recognized and supported. This review will address the key questions associated with survivorship in this disease context, recognizing the dearth of specific data and the urgent need for targeted clinical research and tailored interventions.",

        "abstract": "Background: The 70-gene signature test (MammaPrint) has been shown to improve prediction of clinical outcome in women with early-stage breast cancer. We sought to provide prospective evidence of the clinical utility of the addition of the 70-gene signature to standard clinical-pathological criteria in selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: In this randomized, phase 3 study, we enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer and determined their genomic risk (using the 70-gene signature) and their clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online). Women at low clinical and genomic risk did not receive chemotherapy, whereas those at high clinical and genomic risk did receive such therapy. In patients with discordant risk results, either the genomic risk or the clinical risk was used to determine the use of chemotherapy. The primary goal was to assess whether, among patients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression profile who did not receive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastasis would be 92% (i.e., the noninferiority boundary) or higher. Results: A total of 1550 patients (23.2%) were deemed to be at high clinical risk and low genomic risk. At 5 years, the rate of survival without distant metastasis in this group was 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 92.5 to 96.2) among those not receiving chemotherapy. The absolute difference in this survival rate between these patients and those who received chemotherapy was 1.5 percentage points, with the rate being lower without chemotherapy. Similar rates of survival without distant metastasis were reported in the subgroup of patients who had estrogen-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and either node-negative or node-positive disease. Conclusion: Among women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings, approximately 46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might not require chemotherapy.

        "abstract": "Background: Carriers of a germline TP53 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk of developing cancer. In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or not. We sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol. Methods: A clinical surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging studies (consisting of whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI, mammography, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres in Canada and the USA on Jan 1, 2004, for carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants. After confirmation of TP53 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. Patients could cross over between groups at any time. The primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic tumours by surveillance investigations. The secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established from a tumour diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one diagnosed by surveillance. We completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach. Results: Between Jan 1, 2004, and July 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) patients crossed over from the non-surveillance to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance for a median of 32 months (IQR 12-87). 40 asymptomatic tumours have been detected in 19 (32%) of 59 patients who underwent surveillance. Two additional cancers were diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). Among the 49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic tumours were diagnosed in 43 (88%) patients. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance who developed cancer were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing surveillance who developed cancer (p=0·012) after a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance. 5 year overall survival was 88·8% (95% CI 78·7-100) in the surveillance group and 59·6% (47·2-75·2) in the non-surveillance group (p=0·0132). Conclusion: Our findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol for early tumour detection in individuals with pathogenic TP53 variants is feasible and that early tumour detection through surveillance is associated with improved long-term survival. Incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these patients should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Background: Having a mother diagnosed with breast cancer can be a distressing time for a child. This review examines the impact maternal breast cancer has on the psychosocial functioning of children and what factors possibly moderate this relationship. Methods: Using PRISMA guidelines, five electronic databases were systematically searched for published studies examining maternal breast cancer and the psychosocial functioning of children. Results: A total of 15 studies contributed to the analysis. Results from a random effects meta-analysis show that children experience marginally elevated internalizing problems (standardized mean difference=.14, 95% CI .00, .28), significantly fewer total problem behaviors (standardized mean difference=-.13, 95% CI -.23, -.03), and no changes in externalizing problems (standardized mean difference=-.07, 95% CI -.19, .05) relative to comparison groups. Consistent with this, the narrative review suggests the children may experience elevated depression, anxiety and mental distress yet show more social competence and little aggressive or disruptive behavior. Significant moderating variables included informant type (i.e., self-ratings vs mother's ratings vs other's ratings) and comparison group used (i.e., controls vs normative data). There is also evidence that illness severity and maternal mental health may impact the results. Conclusion: The results suggest that children may be at risk for internalizing-type problems, especially when their mother experiences depression and has serious medical complications. Research using larger and more diverse samples is needed to fully understand how maternal breast cancer impacts children.",

Although previous studies have shown a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence and death among young women with early-stage breast cancer, they have not adequately addressed the role of tumor subtype in outcomes. Methods: We examined data from women with newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer presenting to one of eight National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers between January 2000 and December 2007. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between age and breast cancer-specific survival. Results: A total of 17,575 women with stage I to III breast cancer were eligible for analysis, among whom 1,916 were ≤ 40 years of age at diagnosis. Median follow-up time was 6.4 years. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model controlling for sociodemographic, disease, and treatment characteristics, women ≤ 40 years of age at diagnosis had greater breast cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.7). In stratified analyses, age ≤ 40 years was associated with statistically significant increases in risk of breast cancer death among women with luminal A (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2) and luminal B (HR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9) tumors, with borderline significance among women with triple-negative tumors (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8) but not among those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 subtypes (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.9). In an additional model controlling for detection method, young age was associated with significantly increased risk of breast cancer death only among women with luminal A tumors. Conclusion: The effect of age on survival of women with early breast cancer seems to vary by breast cancer subtype. Young age seems to be particularly prognostic in women with luminal breast cancers.",

        "abstract": "Background: A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of radiation-induced ovarian ablation (RT-OA) on amenorrhea cessation rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival in pre/perimenopausal women with breast cancer. Methods: The Medline, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane Library databases and search engines were searched to identify randomized controlled studies comparing RT-OA with control for early or metastatic breast cancer. Further, radiotherapy doses, techniques, and associated side effects were evaluated. Results: Six controlled trials with a total patient population of 3,317 were identified. Pooled results from these trials showed significant amenorrhea rates (P<0.00001) and increase in progression-free survival in patients treated with RT-OA (P<0.00001). However, there was no difference in overall survival (P=0.37). The majority of patients were treated with larger field sizes with parallel-opposed anteroposterior and posteroanterior pelvic fields. RT-OA was generally well tolerated. Radiotherapy doses of 1,500 cGy in five fractions, 1,500 cGy in four fractions, 1,600 cGy in four fractions, and 2,000 cGy in ten fractions were associated with excellent amenorrhea rates. The resultant funnel plot showed no publication bias (Egger test P=0.16). Conclusion: RT-OA is cost-effective and can safely be used in pre/perimenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, or if luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs are contraindicated, or in patients in whom fertility preservation is not an issue. Radiation dose of 1,500 cGy in five fractions, 1,500 cGy in four fractions, 1,600 cGy in four fractions, and 2,000 cGy in ten fractions showed more efficacies. However, further studies incorporating three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy are warranted.",

Methods: This was a 96-week phase III, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparative study. All patients concomitantly received oral tamoxifen (20 mg daily). The primary endpoint was the suppression rate of serum estradiol (E ) to the menopausal level (≤30 pg/mL) from Week 4 through Week 48. Results: In total, 167 patients were randomized to receive TAP-144-SR (6M) (n = 83) or TAP-144-SR (3M) (n = 84) and the E  suppression rate was 97.6 and 96.4 %, respectively. The estimated between-group difference was 1.2 % (95 % confidence interval -5.2 to 7.8). The non-inferiority of TAP-144-SR (6M) to TAP-144-SR (3M) for E  suppression was confirmed. As for safety, common adverse events were hot flush and injection site reactions including induration, pain, and erythema in both treatment groups, which were of ≤Grade 2 in severity and not serious. No significant between-group differences in safety profiles and tolerability were observed. Conclusion: TAP-144-SR (6M) was not inferior to TAP-144-SR (3M) for its suppressive effect on serum E .

        "abstract": "Background: To update the ASCO adjuvant endocrine therapy guideline based on emerging data concerning the benefits and risks of ovarian suppression in addition to standard adjuvant therapy in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Methods: ASCO convened an Update Panel and conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials investigating ovarian suppression. Results: Two trials investigating the addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not show an overall clinical benefit for ovarian suppression. Nonetheless, the addition of ovarian suppression to standard adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen or with an aromatase inhibitor improved disease-free survival and improved freedom from breast cancer and distant recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone among the subset of patients who were at sufficient risk for recurrence such that adjuvant chemotherapy was warranted. Compared with tamoxifen alone, ovarian suppression was associated with a substantial increase in menopausal symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and diminished quality of life. Conclusion: The Panel recommends that higher-risk patients should receive ovarian suppression in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy, whereas lower-risk patients should not. Women with stage II or III breast cancers who would ordinarily be advised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy should receive ovarian suppression with endocrine therapy. The panel recommends that some women with stage I or II breast cancers at higher risk of recurrence who might consider chemotherapy may also be offered ovarian suppression with endocrine therapy. Women with stage I breast cancers not warranting chemotherapy should not receive ovarian suppression, nor should women with node-negative cancers 1 cm or less. Ovarian suppression may be administered with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A total of 1,073 articles met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical examination, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for post-treatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment, health promotion, and care coordination/practice implications are made.This guideline was developed through a collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Methods: We performed a prospective trial involving women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer with tumors of 1.1 to 5.0 cm in the greatest dimension (or 0.6 to 1.0 cm in the greatest dimension and intermediate or high tumor grade) who met established guidelines for the consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features. A reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay of 21 genes was performed on the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and the results were used to calculate a score indicating the risk of breast-cancer recurrence; patients were assigned to receive endocrine therapy without chemotherapy if they had a recurrence score of 0 to 10, indicating a very low risk of recurrence (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of recurrence). Results: Of the 10,253 eligible women enrolled, 1626 women (15.9%) who had a recurrence score of 0 to 10 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone without chemotherapy. At 5 years, in this patient population, the rate of invasive disease-free survival was 93.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.4 to 94.9), the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.6), the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or local-regional site was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.9 to 99.2), and the rate of overall survival was 98.0% (95% CI, 97.1 to 98.6). Conclusion: Among patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who met established guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features, those with tumors that had a favorable gene-expression profile had very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy alone.

We focus on the active treatment period given the toxicity of treatment, the incidence of anxiety, and depressive symptoms in these women during treatment. This review summarizes research relevant to addressing their social and emotional concerns. Methods: Young women undergoing treatment for breast cancer remain understudied despite unique needs. Psychoeducational interventions help to relieve symptoms and emotional distress during treatment, but effects do not appear to persist over the longer term. In the clinical context, the performance of prognostic-risk prediction models in this population is poor. Surgical decision-making is often driven by fear of recurrence and body image rather than prognosis, and decision aids may help young women to synthesize information to preserve their role in the treatment process. Results: First, shared decision-making, second, balancing body image, fear of recurrence, and recommended treatment, and third, palliative care for metastasis are essential research priorities for the clinical setting. In the larger social context, unique family/partner dynamics as well as financial and insurance concerns warrant particular attention in this population.",

Better knowledge of the unique needs of young women with breast cancer would assist in matching younger women with the right services at the right time. Methods: Younger women (<50 years) represent a minority of breast cancer cases, yet they tend to be overrepresented with respect to demonstrating the poorest psychosocial adjustment during and following treatment. Concerns most frequently reported in this age group pertained to body image, sexual functioning, fertility, relationships, fear of cancer recurrence, and caring for children; failure of healthcare providers to initiate conversations to educate women about treatment side effects early on and/or safely discuss sensitive issues; lack of widespread availability of professional psychosocial programs that are tailored to the unique needs of this age group. Results: Young women with breast cancer are at greater risk for psychosocial adjustment problems, yet their needs are often overlooked. Proactive discussions by healthcare providers early on in treatment, and referrals to relevant services as part of standard care are needed to mitigate younger women's concerns and reduce the likelihood of problems becoming longstanding.",

        "abstract": "Background: This paper summarizes information about breast MRI to be provided to women and referring physicians. After listing contraindications, procedure details are described, stressing the need for correct scheduling and not moving during the examination. The structured report including BI-RADS® categories and further actions after a breast MRI examination are discussed. Breast MRI is a very sensitive modality, significantly improving screening in high-risk women. It also has a role in clinical diagnosis, problem solving, and staging, impacting on patient management. However, it is not a perfect test, and occasionally breast cancers can be missed. Therefore, clinical and other imaging findings (from mammography/ultrasound) should also be considered. Conversely, MRI may detect lesions not visible on other imaging modalities turning out to be benign (false positives). These risks should be discussed with women before a breast MRI is requested/performed. Because breast MRI drawbacks depend upon the indication for the examination, basic information for the most important breast MRI indications is presented. Seventeen notes and five frequently asked questions formulated for use as direct communication to women are provided. The text was reviewed by Europa Donna-The European Breast Cancer Coalition to ensure that it can be easily understood by women undergoing MRI. Methods: • Information on breast MRI concerns advantages/disadvantages and preparation to the examination • Claustrophobia, implantable devices, allergic predisposition, and renal function should be checked • Before menopause, scheduling on day 7-14 of the cycle is preferred • During the examination, it is highly important that the patient keeps still • Availability of prior examinations improves accuracy of breast MRI interpretation.",

        "abstract": "Background: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists provide effective adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Here, we investigated appropriate treatment durations of an LH-RH agonist, leuprorelin. Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of leuprorelin subcutaneously administered every-3-months for 2 versus 3 or more, up to 5 years, together with daily tamoxifen for 5 years in premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and safety. Results: Eligible patients (N = 222) were randomly assigned to receive leuprorelin for either 2 years (N = 112) or 3 or more years (N = 110) with tamoxifen for 5 years after surgery. Leuprorelin treatment for 3 or more years provided no significant difference in DFS rate over 2 years: 94.1 versus 91.8 % at 144 weeks (3 years) after the second year (week 96) and 90.8 versus 90.4 % at the fifth year (week 240). The overall survival rate was 100 % for both groups during the third through fifth year study period. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events (AEs) between the 2 groups: most AEs were rated grade 1 or 2. Conclusion: Adjuvant leuprorelin treatment for 3 or more years with tamoxifen showed a survival benefit and safety profile similar to that for 2 years in premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. No new safety signal was identified for long-term leuprorelin treatment. Longer follow-up observation is needed to determine the optimal duration of leuprorelin treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer arising at a young age is relatively uncommon, particularly in the developed world. Several studies have demonstrated that younger patients often experience a more aggressive disease course and have poorer outcome compared to older women. Expression of key biomarkers, including endocrine receptors, HER2 and proliferation markers, appears to be different in younger patients and young women are more likely to harbor a genetic predisposition. Despite these differences, little research to date has focused on the biology of these tumors to refine prognosis, and potentially direct treatment strategies, which remain similar to those offered to older patients. Accumulating evidence suggests the differences in breast stroma in younger patients and changes that occur with pregnancy and breastfeeding likely contribute to the different biology of these tumors. Reproductive behaviors appear to impact the biology of tumors developing later in life. In addition, tumors arising during or shortly following pregnancy appear to exhibit unique biological features. In this review, we discuss our emerging understanding of the biology of breast cancer arising at a young age at both the pathologic and the genomic level. We elucidate the potential role of genomic signatures, the impact of pregnancy and breastfeeding on breast cancer biology, and how even current knowledge might advance the clinical management of young breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Zoledronic acid (ZOL) plus adjuvant endocrine therapy significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) at 48- and 62-month follow-up in the ABCSG-12 trial. We present efficacy results of a final additional analysis after 94.4 months. Methods: Patients were premenopausal women who had undergone primary surgery for stage I/II estrogen-receptor-positive and/or progesterone-receptor-positive breast cancer with <10 positive lymph nodes, and were scheduled for standard goserelin therapy. All 1803 patients received goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days) and were randomized to tamoxifen (20 mg/days) or anastrozole (1 mg/days), both with or without ZOL (4 mg every 6 months) for 3 years. The primary end point was DFS; recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) were secondary end points. Results: After 94.4-month median follow-up (range, 0-114 months), relative risks of disease progression [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.99; P = 0.042] and of death (HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.43-1.02; P = 0.064) are still reduced by ZOL although no longer significant at the predefined significance level. Overall, 251 DFS events and 86 deaths were reported. Absolute risk reductions with ZOL were 3.4% for DFS and 2.2% for OS. There was no DFS difference between tamoxifen alone versus anastrozole alone, but there was a pronounced higher risk of death for anastrozole-treated patients (HR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.05-1.45; P = 0.030). Treatments were generally well tolerated, with no reports of renal failure or osteonecrosis of the jaw. Conclusion: These final results from ABCSG 12 suggest that twice-yearly ZOL enhances the efficacy of adjuvant endocrine treatment, and this benefit is maintained long-term.",

        "abstract": "Background: Sexual dysfunction is a known complication of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and an important determinant of quality of life. However, few studies have explored how treatment and other factors affect sexual functioning in young breast cancer survivors. Methods: Four hundred sixty-one premenopausal women with stage 0 through III breast cancer were surveyed an average of 1 year after diagnosis as part of a prospective cohort study of women who were aged ≤40 years at diagnosis. Sexual interest and dysfunction were assessed using the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES). Mean CARES scores were compared and multiple regression models were fit to assess treatment and a range of menopausal and somatic symptoms in relation to sexual functioning. Results: Mean CARES sexual interest and dysfunction scores were both highest (indicating poorer functioning) among women who received chemotherapy and were amenorrheic from treatment. After accounting for menopausal and somatic symptoms, treatment-associated amenorrhea remained associated with decreased interest but was no longer an independent predictor of dysfunction. In the multivariable analysis, independent predictors of dysfunction included vaginal pain symptoms, poorer body image, and fatigue. Sexual interest was associated with vaginal pain symptoms, body image, and weight problems. Conclusion: Factors associated with decreased sexual functioning in young breast cancer survivors can often be ameliorated. The current findings have implications for premenopausal women with other types of cancer who might be experiencing amenorrhea because of chemotherapy or surgery. Increased awareness and early intervention is essential to help improve sexual functioning and associated quality of life for all young cancer survivors.",

Approximately 10% of women in our clinic entered the IBIS-I prevention trial. We assess the uptake of tamoxifen in a consecutive series of premenopausal women not in a trial and explore the reasons for uptake through interviews. Methods: All eligible women between 33 and 46 years at ≥17% lifetime risk of breast cancer and undergoing annual mammography in our service were invited to take a 5-year course of tamoxifen. Reasons for accepting (n=15) or declining (n=15) were explored using semi-structured interviews. Results: Of 1279 eligible women, 136 (10.6%) decided to take tamoxifen. Women >40 years (74 out of 553 (13.4%)) and those at higher non-BRCA-associated risk were more likely to accept tamoxifen (129 out of 1109 (11.6%)). Interviews highlighted four themes surrounding decision making: perceived impact of side effects, the impact of others' experience on beliefs about tamoxifen, tamoxifen as a 'cancer drug', and daily reminder of cancer risk. Conclusion: Tamoxifen uptake was similar to previously ascertained uptake in a randomised controlled trial (IBIS-I). Concerns were similar in women who did or did not accept tamoxifen. Decision making appeared to be embedded in the experience of significant others.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer at a young age is associated with poor prognosis. The Prospective Study of Outcomes in Sporadic and Hereditary Breast Cancer (POSH) was designed to investigate factors affecting prognosis in this patient group. Methods: Between 2000 and 2008, 2956 patients aged 40 years or younger were recruited to a UK multicenter prospective observational cohort study (POSH). Details of tumor pathology, disease stage, treatment received, and outcome were recorded. Overall survival (OS) and distant disease-free interval (DDFI) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Median age of patients was 36 years. Median tumor diameter was 22 mm, and 50% of patients had positive lymph nodes; 59% of tumors were grade 3, 33.7% were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and 24% were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive. Five-year OS was higher for patients with ER-positive than ER-negative tumors (85.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.2% to 86.7% vs 75.7%, 95% CI = 72.8% to 78.4%; P < .001), but by eight years, survival was almost equal. The eight-year OS of patients with ER-positive tumors was similar to that of patients with ER-negative tumors in both HER2-positive and HER2-negative subgroups. The flexible parametric survival model for OS shows that the risk of death increases steadily over time for patients with ER-positive tumors in contrast to patients with ER-negative tumors, where risk of death peaked at two years. Conclusion: These results confirm the increased frequency of ER-negative tumors and early relapse in young patients and also demonstrate the equally poor longer-term outlook of young patients who have ER-positive tumors with HER2-negative or -positive disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: For women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer, treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years substantially reduces the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the first 15 years after diagnosis. We aimed to assess the further effects of continuing tamoxifen to 10 years instead of stopping at 5 years. Methods: In the worldwide Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial, 12,894 women with early breast cancer who had completed 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomly allocated to continue tamoxifen to 10 years or stop at 5 years (open control). Allocation (1:1) was by central computer, using minimisation. After entry (between 1996 and 2005), yearly follow-up forms recorded any recurrence, second cancer, hospital admission, or death. We report effects on breast cancer outcomes among the 6846 women with ER-positive disease, and side-effects among all women (with positive, negative, or unknown ER status). Long-term follow-up still continues. This study is registered, number ISRCTN19652633. Results: Among women with ER-positive disease, allocation to continue tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences in 3428 women allocated to continue vs 711 in 3418 controls, p=0·002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths vs 397 deaths, p=0·01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths vs 722 deaths, p=0·01). The reductions in adverse breast cancer outcomes appeared to be less extreme before than after year 10 (recurrence rate ratio [RR] 0·90 [95% CI 0·79–1·02] during years 5–9 and 0·75 [0·62–0·90] in later years; breast cancer mortality RR 0·97 [0·79–1·18] during years 5–9 and 0·71 [0·58–0·88] in later years). The cumulative risk of recurrence during years 5–14 was 21·4% for women allocated to continue versus 25·1% for controls; breast cancer mortality during years 5–14 was 12·2% for women allocated to continue versus 15·0% for controls (absolute mortality reduction 2·8%). Treatment allocation seemed to have no effect on breast cancer outcome among 1248 women with ER-negative disease, and an intermediate effect among 4800 women with unknown ER status. Among all 12,894 women, mortality without recurrence from causes other than breast cancer was little affected (691 deaths without recurrence in 6454 women allocated to continue versus 679 deaths in 6440 controls; RR 0·99 [0·89–1·10]; p=0·84). For the incidence (hospitalisation or death) rates of specific diseases, RRs were as follows: pulmonary embolus 1·87 (95% CI 1·13–3·07, p=0·01 [including 0·2% mortality in both treatment groups]), stroke 1·06 (0·83–1·36), ischaemic heart disease 0·76 (0·60–0·95, p=0·02), and endometrial cancer 1·74 (1·30–2·34, p=0·0002). The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5–14 was 3·1% (mortality 0·4%) for women allocated to continue versus 1·6% (mortality 0·2%) for controls (absolute mortality increase 0·2%). Conclusion: For women with ER-positive disease, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than stopping at 5 years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality, particularly after year 10. These results, taken together with results from previous trials of 5 years of tamoxifen treatment versus none, suggest that 10 years of tamoxifen treatment can approximately halve breast cancer mortality during the second decade after diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: EUSOMA (The European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists) is committed to writing recommendations on different topics of breast cancer care which can be easily adopted and used by health professionals dedicated to the care of patients with breast cancer in their daily practice. In 2011, EUSOMA identified the management of young women with breast cancer as one of the hot topics for which a consensus among European experts was needed. Therefore, the society recently organised a workshop to define such recommendations. Thirteen experts from the different disciplines met for two days to discuss the topic. This international and multidisciplinary panel thoroughly reviewed the literature in order to prepare evidence-based recommendations. During the meeting, two working groups were set up to discuss in detail diagnosis and loco-regional and systemic treatments, including both group aspects of psychology and sexuality. The conclusions reached by the working groups were then discussed in a plenary session to reach panel consensus. Whenever possible, a measure of the level of evidence (LoE) from 1 (the highest) to 4 (the lowest) degree, based on the methodology proposed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), was assigned to each recommendation. The present manuscript presents the recommendations of this consensus group for the management of young women with breast cancer in daily clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Background: There are no specific recommendations for the management of breast cancer patients with germ-line p53 mutations, an exceptional genetic condition, particularly regarding postoperative radiotherapy. Preclinical data suggested that p53 mutations conferred enhanced radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and the few clinical observations showed that Li-Fraumeni families were at a higher risk of secondary radio-induced malignancies. Methods: We reviewed a cohort of patients with germ-line p53 mutations who had been treated for breast cancer as the first tumor event. We assessed their outcome and the incidence of secondary radio-induced malignancies. Results: Among 47 documented Li-Fraumeni families treated from 1997 to 2007 at the Institut Gustave Roussy, 8 patients had been diagnosed with breast cancer as the first tumor event. Three patients had undergone conservative breast surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy and five patients had undergone a mastectomy (3 with postoperative radiotherapy). Thus, 6/8 patients had received postoperative radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 6 years. Median age at the diagnosis of the primary breast cancer was 30 years. The histological characteristics were as follows: intraductal carcinoma in situ (n = 3), invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 4) and a phyllodes tumor (n = 1). Among the 6 patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy, the following events had occurred: 3 ipsilateral breast recurrences, 3 contralateral breast cancers, 2 radio-induced cancers, and 3 new primaries (1 of which was an in-field thyroid cancer with atypical histology). In contrast, only one event had occurred (a contralateral breast cancer) among patients who had not received radiation therapy. Conclusion: These observations could argue in favor of bilateral mastectomy and the avoidance of radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Despite the benefit of adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) on mortality among women with breast cancer (BC), many women are non-adherent with its use. We investigated the effects of early discontinuation and non-adherence to HT on mortality in women enrolled in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC). We identified women diagnosed with hormone-sensitive stage I-III BC, 1996-2007, and used automated pharmacy records to identify prescriptions and dates of refill. We categorized patients as having discontinued HT early if 180 days elapsed from the prior prescription. For those who continued, we categorized patients as adherent if the medication possession ratio was ≥80%. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between discontinuation and non-adherence with all-cause mortality. Among 8,769 women who filled at least one prescription for HT, 2,761 (31%) discontinued therapy. Of those who continued HT, 1,684 (28%) were non-adherent. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 813 women died. Estimated survival at 10 years was 80.7% for women who continued HT versus 73.6% for those who discontinued (P < 0.001). Of those who continued, survival at 10 years was 81.7 and 77.8% in women who adhered and non-adhered, respectively (P < 0.001). Adjusting for clinical and demographic variables, both early discontinuation (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.46) and non-adherence (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81), among those who continued, were independent predictors of mortality. Both early discontinuation and non-adherence to HT were common and associated with increased mortality. Interventions to improve continuation of and adherence to HT may be critical to improve BC survival.",

        "abstract": "Background: Guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, were issued in October 2000. The guidelines recommend that to minimize transmission of community respiratory virus (CRV) infection, health care workers and visitors with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection be restricted from having contact with HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy. To screen HSCT recipients for CRVs, active clinical surveillance for CRV disease should be conducted on all hospitalized HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy, including daily monitoring for signs and symptoms of CRV infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important CRV because it is the most prevalent and because RSV pneumonia has a high case-fatality rate. For this reason, it is recommended that respiratory secretions of any hospitalized HSCT candidate or recipient with signs and symptoms of CRV infection be tested promptly for RSV. If test results are positive, the patient should be treated early and aggressively. Early preemptive therapy with such treatments as aerosolized ribavirin has been proposed, but limited data preclude a recommendation as to the optimal strategy. Lifelong seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all HSCT recipients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Extensive application of anti-HER2 targeted therapy improves significantly the HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (BC) prognosis, however, it is still difficult to treat brain metastasis. In current study, we explored effective approaches   combining pyrotinib to treat brain metastasis in patients with HER2-positive advanced BC based upon clinical data. Methods: Current study included 61 HER2-positive BC patients with brain metastases (BM) who were treated by pyrotinib-based regimens. The systemic regimens included pyrotinib combined with capecitabine, pyrotinib combined with nab-paclitaxel, and pyrotinib combined with vinorelbine. Patients' progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR) and objective response rate (ORR), as well as drug-related adverse events (AEs) in regard of each combination regimen were analyzed. Results: Pyrotinib-based systemic therapy resulted in 8.6 months median PFS (mPFS) and 18.0 months median OS (mOS) among the BM patients. Regarding different regimens, the combination of pyrotinib with nab-paclitaxel was superior to the combination with capecitabine and vinorelbine with respect to PFS and OS. The central nervous system (CNS) ORR did not showcase significant difference among 3 regimens, however, nab-paclitaxel combined regimen obtained the best peripheral ORR (84.6%) (  ≤ .05). Conclusion: Pyrotinib-based combination therapy is safe for HER2-positive brain metastasis treatment. Compared with vinorelbine or capecitabine, pyrotinib combined with nab-paclitaxel is more effective with less toxicity, which is the preferable regimen for HER2-positive brain metastasis.KEY MESSAGESPresent investigation investigated effective methods through combining pyrotinib to treat brain metastasis with HER2-positive advanced brain cancer. The outcomes verified that pyrotinib-based combination therapy was safe and efficient to treat HER2-positive brain metastasis. Therefore, it is effective to treat brain metastasis applying anti-HER2 targeted therapies although pyrotinib showcases efficiency regarding its treatments for the metastasis.",

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate with an SN-38 payload targeting trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2, an epithelial antigen expressed in breast cancer. Methods: In this global, randomized, phase III study, SG was compared with physician's choice chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine) in endocrine-resistant, chemotherapy-treated HR+/HER2- locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Results: Patients were randomly assigned to receive SG (n = 272) or chemotherapy (n = 271). The median age was 56 years, 95% had visceral metastases, and 99% had a prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, with three median lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Primary end point was met with a 34% reduction in risk of progression or death (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83;   = .0003]). The median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 7.0) with SG and 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 4.4) with chemotherapy; the PFS at 6 and 12 months was 46% (95% CI, 39 to 53)   30% (95% CI, 24 to 37) and 21% (95% CI, 15 to 28)   7% (95% CI, 3 to 14), respectively. Median overall survival (first planned interim analysis) was not yet mature (hazard ratio, 0.84;   = .14).

Methods: We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial to compare the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (a HER2 antibody-drug conjugate) with those of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The primary end point was progression-free survival (as determined by blinded independent central review); secondary end points included overall survival, objective response, and safety. Results: Among 524 randomly assigned patients, the percentage of those who were alive without disease progression at 12 months was 75.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.8 to 80.7) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 34.1% (95% CI, 27.7 to 40.5) with trastuzumab emtansine (hazard ratio for progression or death from any cause, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.37; P<0.001). The percentage of patients who were alive at 12 months was 94.1% (95% CI, 90.3 to 96.4) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 85.9% (95% CI, 80.9 to 89.7) with trastuzumab emtansine (hazard ratio for death, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86; prespecified significance boundary not reached). An overall response (a complete or partial response) occurred in 79.7% (95% CI, 74.3 to 84.4) of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and in 34.2% (95% CI, 28.5 to 40.3) of those who received trastuzumab emtansine. The incidence of drug-related adverse events of any grade was 98.1% with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 86.6% with trastuzumab emtansine, and the incidence of drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was 45.1% and 39.8%, respectively. Adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 10.5% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and in 1.9% of those in the trastuzumab emtansine group; none of these events were of grade 4 or 5. Conclusion: Among patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, the risk of disease progression or death was lower among those who received trastuzumab deruxtecan than among those who received trastuzumab emtansine. Treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan was associated with interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca; DESTINY-Breast03 ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "abstract": "Background: In a previous analysis of this phase 3 trial, first-line ribociclib plus letrozole resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than letrozole alone among postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Whether overall survival would also be longer with ribociclib was not known. Methods: Here we report the results of the protocol-specified final analysis of overall survival, a key secondary end point. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ribociclib or placebo in combination with letrozole. Overall survival was assessed with the use of a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods after 400 deaths had occurred. A hierarchical testing strategy was used for the analysis of progression-free survival and overall survival to ensure the validity of the findings. Results: After a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 181 deaths had occurred among 334 patients (54.2%) in the ribociclib group and 219 among 334 (65.6%) in the placebo group. Ribociclib plus letrozole showed a significant overall survival benefit as compared with placebo plus letrozole. Median overall survival was 63.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.4 to 71.0) with ribociclib plus letrozole and 51.4 months (95% CI, 47.2 to 59.7) with placebo plus letrozole (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.93; two-sided P = 0.008). No new safety signals were observed. Conclusion: First-line therapy with ribociclib plus letrozole showed a significant overall survival benefit as compared with placebo plus letrozole in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

The median OS was not reached in the ribociclib arm in the protocol-specified final analysis; we hence performed an exploratory OS and additional outcomes analysis with an extended follow-up (median, 53.5 months). Methods: Patients were randomized to receive ET [goserelin plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) or tamoxifen] with ribociclib or placebo. OS was evaluated with a stratified Cox proportional hazard model and summarized with Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: The intent-to-treat population included 672 patients. Median OS was 58.7 months with ribociclib versus 48.0 months with placebo [hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.96]. Kaplan-Meier estimated OS at 48 months was 60% and 50% with ribociclib and placebo, respectively. Subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the OS benefit, including patients who received NSAI and patients aged less than 40 years. Subsequent antineoplastic therapies following discontinuation were balanced between the ribociclib (77%) and placebo (78%) groups. Use of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors after discontinuation was higher with placebo (26%) versus ribociclib (13%). Time to first chemotherapy was significantly delayed with ribociclib versus placebo. No drug-drug interactions were observed between ribociclib and either NSAI. Conclusion: Ribociclib plus ET continued to show significantly longer OS than ET alone in pre-/perimenopausal patients, including patients aged less than 40 years, with HR+/HER2- ABC with 53.5 months of median follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov,  ).",

        "abstract": "Background: The previous studies had demonstrated the promising effectiveness and acceptable safety of pyrotinib in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to investigate the real-world data of pyrotinib in complex clinical practice and complement the findings of clinical trials. Two hundred and eighteen patients were included for effectiveness analysis. A total of 62.0% had received two or more lines of systematic therapy, and 95.4% had been exposed to prior anti-HER2 therapy, with 95.4% receiving trastuzumab, 5.0% receiving pertuzumab, and 40.8% receiving lapatinib. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.3 months and the objective response rate (ORR) was 44.0%. Patients treated with pyrotinib-based therapy as first, second, or later line had a median PFS of 15.0, 10.3, and 6.8 months, respectively. Patients treated with pyrotinib and trastuzumab received significant benefit in terms of median PFS compared with pyrotinib alone (10.7 (9.1-12.3) vs. 8.8 (8.1-9.5), p = 0.016). Patients pretreated with lapatinib had a median PFS of 6.9 months. The median PFS time was 7.0 months in patients with brain metastasis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that lines of pyrotinib-based therapy (1 vs. 2 vs. ≥3), prior treatment with lapatinib, and combination treatments with trastuzumab proved to be independent predictors of PFS. Two hundred and forty-eight patients were included in the safety analysis, and the results showed that the toxicity of pyrotinib was tolerable, with the most common grade 3/4 adverse event being diarrhea (19.8%). Pyrotinib-based therapy demonstrated promising efficacy and tolerable toxicity in first-, second-, and later-line treatments and in lapatinib-treated patients. The combination of pyrotinib and trastuzumab showed advantages in PFS, even for patients resisting trastuzumab. Pyrotinib-based therapy could be the preferred choice for brain metastasis patients, especially when combined with brain radiotherapy.",

We report data for clinically prognostic subgroups: liver metastases, progesterone receptor status, tumor grade, bone-only disease, ECOG performance status, and treatment-free interval (TFI) from an additional 12-month follow-up (after final progression-free survival [PFS] readout). In the intent-to-treat population, after median follow-up of approximately 39 months, the updated PFS was 28.2 versus 14.8 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval, 0.415-0.665) in abemaciclib versus placebo arms, respectively. Time to chemotherapy (HR, 0.513), time to second disease progression (HR, 0.637), and duration of response (HR, 0.466) were also statistically significantly prolonged with the addition of abemaciclib to AI. Treatment benefit was observed across all subgroups, as evidenced by objective response rate change from the addition of abemaciclib to AI, with the largest effects observed in patients with liver metastases, progesterone receptor-negative tumors, high-grade tumors, or TFI < 36 months. Extended follow-up in the MONARCH 3 trial further confirmed that the addition of abemaciclib to AI conferred significant treatment benefit to all subgroups, including those with poorer prognosis.",

This prespecified, exploratory biomarker analysis from the ASCENT trial evaluates the association between tumor Trop-2 expression and germline BRCA1/2 mutation status with clinical outcomes. Methods: Patients with mTNBC refractory to or progressing after two or more prior chemotherapies, with one or more in the metastatic setting, were randomized to receive SG (10 mg/kg intravenously days 1 and 8, every 21 days) or TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Biopsy or surgical specimens were collected at study entry to determine Trop-2 expression level using a validated immunohistochemistry assay and histochemical scoring. Germline BRCA1/2 mutation status was collected at baseline. Results: Of 468 assessable patients, 290 had Trop-2 expression data [64% (n = 151 SG) versus 60% (n = 139 TPC)] and 292 had known BRCA1/2 mutation status [63% (n = 149 SG) versus 61% (n = 143 TPC)]. Median progression-free survival in SG- versus TPC-treated patients was 6.9, 5.6, and 2.7 months versus 2.5, 2.2, and 1.6 months for high, medium, and low Trop-2 expression, respectively. Median overall survival (14.2, 14.9, and 9.3 months versus 6.9, 6.9, and 7.6 months) and objective response rates (44%, 38%, and 22% versus 1%, 11%, and 6%) were numerically higher with SG versus TPC in patients with high, medium, and low Trop-2 expression, respectively. Efficacy outcomes were numerically higher with SG versus TPC in patients with and without germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Conclusion: SG benefits patients with previously treated mTNBC expressing high/medium Trop-2 compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy and regardless of germline BRCA1/2 mutation status. The small number of patients with low Trop-2 expression precludes definitive conclusions on the benefit of SG in this subgroup.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients with HER2-positive (HER2 ) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have poor prognoses. Pyrotinib has shown promising antitumor activity in MBC to improve progression-free survival (PFS). However, findings based on real-world data to analyze whether pyrotinib affects overall survival (OS) remain scarce. Methods: This real-world study is an exploratory analysis of brain metastasis (BM) and the final update of our preceding study of 168 patients with HER2  MBC. PFS, OS, tumor mutation burden (TMB), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and overall response rate (ORR) were analyzed. Results: Pyrotinib treatment led to a median PFS time of 8.00 months and a median OS of 19.07 months in the 168 participants. High TMB was associated with poor OS (  = 0.0072) and PFS (  = 0.0028). In the 39 patients with BM, the median PFS and OS were 8.67 and 13.93 months, respectively. The surgery/radiation (S/R) group of patients with BM had prolonged survival (PFS: 9.97 vs. 7.73 months   = 0.19; OS: 20.67 vs. 12.43 months   = 0.021) compared with the no surgery/no radiation group (NS/NR). The CBR was 58.6% (S/R) vs. 41.4% (NS/NR), while the ORR was 24.1% (S/R) vs. 31.0% (NS/NR). Conclusion: Pyrotinib shows promise as a novel pan-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for the treatment of BM and should be evaluated further. Surgical or radiotherapy in combination with pyrotinib was found to statistically improve OS in our cohort. TMB could be an exploratory biomarker for predicting PFS and OS, but its clinical application still needs further verification.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Korean women, and its incidence continues to increase. The Korean Breast Cancer Society (KBCS) established a nationwide breast cancer database through its online enrollment program in 1996. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of breast cancer in Korea, and to assess the pattern of changes in breast cancer management in 2018. We analyzed the KBCS and Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) databases in 2018. In 2018, 28,157 patients were newly diagnosed with breast cancer, of whom 4,510 had noninvasive breast cancer and 23,647 had invasive breast cancer. The age-standardized rate of breast cancer in 2018 was 79.0 per 100,000 women (65.6 invasive, 13.4 noninvasive). The median age of female patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 was 52 years, and the incidence of breast cancer was the highest in the 40-49-years age group (9,432 patients, 33.6%). The proportion of patients with stage 0 and stage I breast cancer continued to increase, accounting for 63.8% of cases, and breast-conserving surgery was performed more often than mastectomy (66.2% vs. 33.0%). The most common subtypes of breast cancer were hormone receptor [HR]-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative types (65.9% of cases), while the HR-negative and HER2-positive types accounted for 9.2% of cases. According to the KCCR data, from 2014 to 2018, the 5-year relative survival rate of patients with breast cancer was 93.3%, which was 14.0% higher than that from 1993 to 1995 (79.3%). The clinical characteristics of breast cancer in Korea have been changing, and national databases can improve our understanding of the disease characteristics of Korean women. Therefore, updating the KBCS registry is important for the effective management of breast cancer in Korea.",

Methods: Eligible women had progressed on (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), ≤ 12 months from end of adjuvant ET, or on first-line ET for ABC, and had not received chemotherapy for ABC. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetics (PK), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety. Results: In Japan, 95 patients were randomized (abemaciclib, n = 64; placebo, n = 31). At final PFS analysis (February 14, 2017), median PFS was 21.2 and 14.3 months, respectively, in the abemaciclib and placebo groups (hazard ratio: 0.672; 95% confidence interval: 0.380-1.189). Abemaciclib had a higher objective response rate (37.5%) than placebo (12.9%). PK and safety profiles for Japanese patients were consistent with those of the overall population, without clinically meaningful differences across most HRQoL dimensions evaluated. The most frequent adverse events in the abemaciclib versus placebo groups were diarrhea (95.2 versus 25.8%), neutropenia (79.4 versus 0%), and leukopenia (66.7 versus 0%). At a second data cutoff (June 20, 2019), median OS was not reached with abemaciclib and 47.3 months with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.755; 95% confidence interval: 0.390-1.463).

Methods: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative germline BRCA1/2-mutated advanced breast cancer who received prior chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to talazoparib 1 mg/day or chemotherapy (physician's choice). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per independent central review in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This post-hoc analysis evaluated efficacy/safety endpoints in the ITT population of patients enrolled in Asian regions. Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled at Asian sites (talazoparib, n=23; chemotherapy, n=10). Baseline characteristics were generally comparable with the overall EMBRACA population. In Asian patients, median PFS was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 15.2) for talazoparib and 7.1 months (95% CI, 1.2 to not reached) for chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.22 to 2.44]). Objective response rate was numerically higher for talazoparib vs. chemotherapy (62.5% [95% CI, 35.4 to 84.8] vs. 25.0% [95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1]).

In Asian patients, fewer grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), grade 3/4 SAEs, and AEs resulting in dose reduction/discontinuation occurred with talazoparib than chemotherapy; for talazoparib, the frequency of these events was lower in Asian patients versus overall EMBRACA population. Conclusion: In this subgroup analysis, talazoparib numerically improved efficacy versus chemotherapy and was generally well tolerated in Asian patients, with fewer grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AE (TEAEs), SAEs, and TEAEs leading to dose modification vs. the overall EMBRACA population.",

We assessed health-related quality of life using patient-reported outcome measures in these patients. Methods: In the  -mutant cohort, 341 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive alpelisib 300 mg daily or placebo plus fulvestrant 500 mg on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL of Cancer Patients and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form questionnaires. Changes from baseline and time to 10% deterioration were analyzed using repeated measurement models and Cox models, respectively. Results: Global Health Status/QoL and functional status were maintained from baseline (mean changes < 10 points) in the alpelisib (overall change from baseline [95% CI], -3.50 [-8.02 to 1.02]) and placebo arms (overall change from baseline [95% CI], 0.27 [-4.48 to 5.02]). Overall treatment effect in Global Health Status/QoL was not significantly different between arms (-3.77; 95% CI, -8.35 to 0.80;   = .101). Time to 10% deterioration for Global Health Status/QoL was similar between arms (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.48). Compared with placebo, deterioration in social functioning and in diarrhea, appetite loss, nausea or vomiting, and fatigue symptom subscales occurred with alpelisib. Numerical improvement in Worst Pain was observed with alpelisib versus placebo (42%   32%, week 24;   = .090). Conclusion: In SOLAR-1, there was no statistical difference in deterioration of Global Health Status/QoL between arms, whereas symptom subscales favored placebo for diarrhea, appetite loss, nausea or vomiting, and fatigue, known side effects of alpelisib. Treatment decisions must consider efficacy and tolerability; taken with clinical efficacy, these results support the benefit-risk profile of alpelisib in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative  -mutated advanced breast cancer.",

In the PHOEBE study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib (an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor) plus capecitabine after previous trastuzumab. Methods: This is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 29 hospitals in China. Patients with pathologically confirmed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, aged 18-70 years, who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and had been previously treated with trastuzumab and taxanes were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral pyrotinib 400 mg or lapatinib 1250 mg once daily plus oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m  twice daily on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive web-response system with a block size of four or six and stratified by hormone receptor status and previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to masked independent central review. Efficacy and safety were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. Results presented here are from a prespecified interim analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between July 31, 2017, and Oct 30, 2018, 267 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. 134 patients received pyrotinib plus capecitabine and 132 received lapatinib plus capecitabine. At data cutoff of the interim analysis on March 31, 2019, median progression-free survival was significantly longer with pyrotinib plus capecitabine (12·5 months [95% CI 9·7-not reached]) than with lapatinib plus capecitabine (6·8 months [5·4-8·1]; hazard ratio 0·39 [95% CI 0·27-0·56]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (41 [31%] in the pyrotinib group vs 11 [8%] in the lapatinib group) and hand-foot syndrome (22 [16%] vs 20 [15%]). Serious adverse events were reported for 14 (10%) patients in the pyrotinib group and 11 (8%) patients in the lapatinib group. No treatment-related deaths were reported in the pyrotinib group and one sudden death in the lapatinib group was considered treatment related. Conclusion: Pyrotinib plus capecitabine significantly improved progression-free survival compared with that for lapatinib plus capecitabine, with manageable toxicity, and can be considered an alternative treatment option for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after trastuzumab and chemotherapy.",

Results: Between January 2013 and November 2019, 105 patients were enrolled in the pyrotinib group (n=55) or T-DM1 group (n=50). The median PFS was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 7.3 months) with pyrotinib and 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 4.8 months) with T-DM1 (P=0.044). ORR values were 16.3% and 20.0% in the pyrotinib and T-DM1 groups, respectively (P=0.629); CBR values were 45.5% and 40.0% in the pyrotinib and T-DM1 groups, respectively (P=0.573). Subgroup analysis of those benefitting from lapatinib revealed a median PFS of 8.1 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 11.4 months) in the pyrotinib group, whereas that of the T-DM1 group was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.0 months, P=0.013). Moreover, the median PFS of patients without liver metastases was 6.9 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.1 months) in the pyrotinib group and 4.1 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 5.1 months) in the T-DM1 group (P=0.010). The main common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (98.2%) and nausea (49.1%) in the pyrotinib group and thrombocytopenia (42.0%) and nausea (40.0%) in the T-DM1 group. The percentages of grade 3 to 4 AEs in the pyrotinib and T-DM1 groups were 34.5% and 40.0%, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that patients with HER2-positive MBC with trastuzumab and lapatinib failure can benefit from subsequent pyrotinib treatment and tolerate this treatment well, especially those who have benefited from previous lapatinib treatment or those who have no liver metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Background: The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy and safety of lapatinib-based treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (HER2 ) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The aim of the present real-world study was to investigate the medical records and follow-up information of 92 patients with HER2  MBC who received a lapatinib-based regimen at the recurrent/metastatic stage, 78 of whom had been pretreated with trastuzumab. The results demonstrated that the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.8 months and the overall survival (OS) was 21.5 months, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 21.7%, disease control rate (DCR) of 87.0% and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 47.8%. In the patients receiving a lapatinib-based regimen as first-, second- and third/later-line treatment, the median PFS was 10.4, 5.2 and 5.1 months (P=0.048), the median OS was 32.9, 29.1 and 13.0 months (P<0.001), the ORR was 38.9, 23.3 and 13.60%, and the DCR was 100, 83.3 and 84.1%, respectively. In the trastuzumab-resistant (n=71) and trastuzumab-sensitive (n=21) patients, the median PFS was 5.2 and 9.1 months (P=0.032), and the median OS was 21.4 and 44.3 months (P=0.003), respectively. In the patients who received lapatinib plus chemotherapy (n=68), the median PFS with lapatinib plus capecitabine (n=38) was 8.1 months, as compared with the 5.1 months with lapatinib plus other chemotherapy agents (n=30; P=0.005). The median PFS of 14 patients with brain metastases was 8.4 months, with an ORR of 35.7% and a DCR of 85.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the line of lapatinib-based treatment and its combination with capecitabine or a different agent were independent prognostic factors for the median PFS in patients with HER2  MBC. A limited number of adverse events were observed with the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine. Therefore, the findings of the present study suggested that lapatinib-based treatment is effective in patients with HER2  MBC (even in trastuzumab-pretreated patients), and the combination of lapatinib with capecitabine may be recommended due to its good efficacy, convenience and tolerability.",

We report final overall survival (OS). Methods: This randomized phase III trial enrolled patients with gBRCA1/2-mutated HER2-negative ABC. Patients received talazoparib or physician's choice of chemotherapy. OS was analyzed using stratified HR and log-rank test and prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for subsequent treatments. Results: A total of 431 patients were entered in a randomized study (287 talazoparib/144 chemotherapy) with 412 patients treated (286 talazoparib/126 chemotherapy). By 30 September 2019, 216 deaths (75.3%) occurred for talazoparib and 108 (75.0%) chemotherapy; median follow-up was 44.9 and 36.8 months, respectively. HR for OS with talazoparib versus chemotherapy was 0.848 (95% CI 0.670-1.073; P = 0.17); median (95% CI) 19.3 months (16.6-22.5 months) versus 19.5 months (17.4-22.4 months). Kaplan-Meier survival percentages (95% CI) for talazoparib versus chemotherapy: month 12, 71% (66% to 76%)/74% (66% to 81%); month 24, 42% (36% to 47%)/38% (30% to 47%); month 36, 27% (22% to 33%)/21% (14% to 29%). Most patients received subsequent treatments: for talazoparib and chemotherapy, 46.3%/41.7% received platinum and 4.5%/32.6% received a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, respectively. Adjusting for subsequent PARP and/or platinum use, HR for OS was 0.756 (95% bootstrap CI 0.503-1.029). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 69.6% (talazoparib) and 64.3% (chemotherapy) patients, consistent with previous reports. Extended follow-up showed significant overall improvement and delay in time to definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in global health status/quality of life and breast symptoms favoring talazoparib versus chemotherapy (P < 0.01 for all), consistent with initial analyses. Conclusion: In gBRCA1/2-mutated HER2-negative ABC, talazoparib did not significantly improve OS over chemotherapy; subsequent treatments may have impacted analysis. Safety was consistent with previous observations. PRO continued to favor talazoparib.",

        "abstract": "Background: In postmenopausal, estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer, the risk for distant recurrence can extend beyond 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. This study aims to identify genomic driver alterations associated with late distant recurrence. Methods: Next generation sequencing was used to characterize driver alterations in primary tumors from a subset of 764 postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative patients from the BIG 1-98 randomized trial. Late distant recurrence events were defined as ≥5 years from time of randomization). The association of driver alterations with distant recurrence-free interval in early and late time periods was assessed using Cox regression models. Multivariable analyses were carried out to adjust for clinicopathological factors. Weighted analysis methods were used in order to correct for over-sampling of distant recurrences. Results: A total of 538 of 764 (70%) samples were successfully sequenced including 88 (63%) early and 52 (37%) late distant recurrence events after a median follow up of 8.1 years. In univariable analysis for late distant recurrence, PIK3CA mutations (58.8%) were significantly associated with reduced risk [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.82, P = 0.012], whereas amplifications on chromosome 8p11 (10.9%) (HR 4.79, 95% CI 2.30-9.97, P < 0.001) and BRCA2 mutations (2.3%) (HR 5.39, 95% CI 1.51-19.29, P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk. In multivariable analysis, only amplifications on 8p11 (P = 0.002) and BRCA2 mutations (P = 0.013) remained significant predictors. Conclusion: In estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative postmenopausal early breast cancer, PIK3CA mutations were associated with reduced risk of late distant recurrence, whereas amplifications on 8p11 and BRCA2 mutations were associated with increased risk of late distant recurrence. The characterization of oncogenic driver alterations may aid in refining treatment choices in the late disease setting, and help identify potential drug targets for testing in future trials.",

Because TNBC tumors lack ER, PR, and HER2 expression, they are not sensitive to endocrine therapy or HER2 treatment, and standardized TNBC treatment regimens are still lacking. Therefore, development of new TNBC treatment strategies has become an urgent clinical need. By summarizing existing treatment regimens, therapeutic drugs, and their efficacy for different TNBC subtypes and reviewing some new preclinical studies and targeted treatment regimens for TNBC, this paper aims to provide new ideas for TNBC treatment.",

Here, we report pre-specified analyses of data from Asian (China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan) patients in the study. All patients were randomized 2:1 to olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or single-agent chemotherapy TPC (21-day cycles of either capecitabine, eribulin or vinorelbine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by blinded independent central review. The prevalence of gBRCAm in the OlympiAD Asian subgroup screened for study recruitment was 13.5%. Patient demographics and disease characteristics of the Asian subgroup (87/302 patients) were generally well balanced between treatment arms. Asian patients in the olaparib arm achieved longer median progression-free survival, assessed by blinded independent central review, versus the chemotherapy TPC arm (5.7 vs 4.2 months; HR = 0.53 [95% CI: 0.29-0.97]), which was consistent with findings in the global OlympiAD study population. Findings on secondary efficacy and safety/tolerability outcome measures in Asian patients were also similar to those observed in the global OlympiAD study population. The OlympiAD study was not powered to detect race-related differences between treatment groups; however, the consistency of our findings with the global OlympiAD study population suggests that previously reported findings are generalizable to Asian patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women. To date, regional differences in breast cancer risk factors have not been identified. The aim of our review was to gain a better understanding of the role of risk factors in women with breast cancer in Asia. Methods: We conducted a PubMed search on 15 March 2016, for journal articles published in English between 2011 and 2016, which reported data for human subjects in Asia with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Search terms included breast neoplasm, epidemiology, Asia, prevalence, incidence, risk and cost of illness. Studies of any design were included, except for review articles and meta-analyses, which were excluded to avoid duplication of data. No exclusions were made based on breast cancer treatment. We reported the results using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 776 abstracts were retrieved. After screening against the eligibility criteria, 562 abstracts were excluded. The remaining 214 abstracts, which were published between 2013 and 2015, were included in this review. Results were summarized and reported under three categories: incidence, prevalence or outcomes for breast cancer in Asia; modifiable risk factors; and non-modifiable risk factors. We found that the increased risk of breast cancer among participants from Asia was associated with older age, family history of breast cancer, early menarche, late menopause, high body mass index, being obese or overweight, exposure to tobacco smoke, and high dietary intake of fats or fatty foods. In contrast, intake of dietary fruits, vegetables, and plant- and soy-based products was associated with a decreased breast cancer risk. While based on limited data, when compared to women from the United States, women from Asia had a decreased risk of breast cancer. Conclusion: This review of 214 abstracts of studies in Asia, published between 2013 and 2015, confirmed the relevance of known non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors for women with breast cancer.",

A dose escalation and expansion phase I study evaluated the safety and activity of T-DXd in patients with advanced HER2-expressing/mutated solid tumors. Here, results for T-DXd at the recommended doses for expansion (RDE) in patients with HER2-low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-) breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ) are reported. Methods: Eligible patients had advanced/metastatic HER2-low-expressing breast cancer refractory to standard therapies. The RDE of 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg T-DXd were administered intravenously once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. Antitumor activity and safety were assessed. Results: Between August 2016 and August 2018, 54 patients were enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of T-DXd at the RDE. Patients were extensively pretreated (median, 7.5 prior therapies). The confirmed objective response rate by independent central review was 20/54 (37.0%; 95% CI, 24.3% to 51.3%) with median duration of response of 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.8 month to not evaluable). Most patients (53/54; 98.1%) experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; grade ≥ 3; 34/54; 63.0%). Common (≥ 5%) grade ≥ 3 TEAEs included decreases in neutrophil, platelet, and WBC counts; anemia; hypokalemia; AST increase; decreased appetite; and diarrhea. Three patients treated at 6.4 mg/kg suffered fatal events associated with T-DXd-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee. Conclusion: The novel HER2-targeted ADC, T-DXd, demonstrated promising preliminary antitumor activity in patients with HER2-low breast cancer. Most toxicities were GI or hematologic in nature. ILD is an important identified risk and should be monitored closely and proactively managed.",

We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pyrotinib versus lapatinib, both in combination with capecitabine, in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer in an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II study. Methods: Chinese patients with HER2-positive relapsed or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with taxanes, anthracyclines, and/or trastuzumab were assigned (1:1) to receive 400 mg pyrotinib or lapatinib 1,250 mg orally once per day for 21-day cycles in combination with capecitabine (1,000 mg/m  orally twice per day on days 1 to 14). The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Results: Between May 29, 2015, and March 15, 2016, 128 eligible patients were randomly assigned to the pyrotinib (n = 65) or lapatinib (n = 63) treatment groups. The overall response rate was 78.5% (95% CI, 68.5% to 88.5%) with pyrotinib and 57.1% (95% CI, 44.9% to 69.4%) with lapatinib (treatment difference, 21.3%; 95% CI, 4.0% to 38.7%;   = .01). The median progression-free survival was 18.1 months (95% CI, 13.9 months to not reached) with pyrotinib and 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.8 months) with lapatinib (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.58;   < .001). The most frequent grade 3 to 4 adverse events were hand-foot syndrome in 16 of 65 patients (24.6%) in the pyrotinib group versus 13 of 63 (20.6%) in the lapatinib group; diarrhea in 10 patients (15.4%) versus three patients (4.8%), respectively; and decreased neutrophil count in six patients (9.2%) versus two patients (3.2%), respectively. Conclusion: In women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with taxanes, anthracyclines, and/or trastuzumab, pyrotinib plus capecitabine yielded statistically significant better overall response rate and progression-free survival than lapatinib plus capecitabine in this randomized phase II trial.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer in young Asian women has distinctive clinicopathological characteristics; hence, we question the universal generalizability of treatment recommendations based on data from predominantly non-Asian postmenopausal women. Methods: The Asian Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (ABCCG) reviewed current ESO-ESMO and St. Gallen recommendations for treating hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer in premenopausal women. Points disputed by ≥ 3/12 members were discussed, and statements on contentious issues formulated for anonymous voting; consensus required a ≥ 75% majority. Results: The ABCCG contends that: (1) Trials in premenopausal women are not only necessary, but also worthwhile if performed separately from others that also enroll postmenopausal participants. (2) Not all premenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer need adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS). (3) Certain clinical factors might influence decision-making about prescribing OFS. (4) For early HR+/HER2- breast cancer in premenopausal patients with OFS, tamoxifen is preferred for intermediate-risk cases; for high risk, near-consensus supported aromatase inhibitor, despite no clear overall survival benefit versus tamoxifen. (5) Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score  has different treatment implications in patients aged ≤ 50 versus > 50 years. (6) High-risk patients (if premenopausal after chemotherapy) should receive adjuvant chemotherapy and OFS plus aromatase inhibitor. (7) For patients with advanced disease receiving OFS on a backbone of tamoxifen, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists may be given 12-weekly. (8) For premenopausal women who decline OFS or oophorectomy, tamoxifen alone is still an option but is considered less effective; other monotherapies are also less effective than OFS plus such treatments. Conclusion: Premenopausal Asian women with breast cancer have unique disease characteristics and may benefit from treatment that differs somewhat from international guidelines. Given the great diversity of patients and clinical settings worldwide, the ABCCG advocates evidence-based yet flexible and individualized use of all potential options to improve breast cancer outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Background: During the past few decades, the incidence of breast cancer (BC) has been increasing rapidly in East Asia, and BC is currently the most common cancer in several countries. The rising incidence is likely related to changing lifestyle and environmental factors in addition to the increase in early diagnosis with BC awareness and screening. The understanding and management of BC are generally based on research and data from the West. However, emerging differences in BC epidemiology and tumor and host biology in Asian populations may be clinically relevant. Methods: A higher proportion of premenopausal BCs occur in Asia, although this factor is possibly an age-cohort effect. Although the relative frequencies of different immunohistochemical subtypes of BC may be similar between the East and West, the higher prevalence of luminal B subtypes with more frequent mutations in TP53 may be confounded by disparities in early detection. In addition, Asian BCs appear to harbor a more immune-active microenvironment than BCs in the West. The spectra of germline mutations in BC predisposition genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms contributing to BC risk vary with ethnicity as well. Differences in tolerability of certain cytotoxic and targeted agents used in BC treatment may be associated with pharmacogenomic factors, whereas the lower body mass of the average woman in East Asia may contribute to higher toxicities from drugs administered at fixed doses. Phenotypic characteristics, such as lower breast volume, may influence the type of surgery performed in East Asian women. On the other hand, increased breast density may affect the sensitivity of mammography in detecting BCs, limiting the benefits of screening mammography. Results: Breast cancer has become a major health problem in Asia. The inclusion of more women from Asia in clinical trials and epidemiologic and translational studies may help unravel the interethnic heterogeneity of BCs and elucidate the complex interplay between environmental and intrinsic factors in its pathogenesis. These insights may help to refine prevention, diagnosis, and management strategies for BC in the setting of ethnic diversity.",

        "abstract": "Background: The incidence of breast cancer among younger East Asian women has been increasing rapidly over recent decades. This international collaborative study systemically compared the differences in age-specific incidences and pathological characteristics of breast cancer in East Asian women and women of predominantly European ancestry. Methods: We excerpted analytic data from six national cancer registries (979 675 cases) and eight hospitals (18 008 cases) in East Asian countries and/or regions and, for comparisons, from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database. Linear regression analyses of age-specific incidences of female breast cancer and logistic regression analyses of age-specific pathological characteristics of breast cancer were performed. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Unlike female colorectal cancer, the age-specific incidences of breast cancer among East Asian women aged 59 years and younger increased disproportionally over recent decades relative to rates in US contemporaries. For years 2010-2014, the estimated age-specific probability of estrogen receptor positivity increased with age in American patients, whereas that of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) declined with age. No similar trends were evident in East Asian patients; their probability of estrogen receptor positivity at age 40-49 years was statistically significantly higher (odd ratio [OR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36 to 1.67, P < .001) and of TNBC was statistically significantly lower (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.88, P < .001), whereas the probability of ER positivity at age 50-59 years was statistically significantly lower (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.828 to 0.95, P < .001). Subgroup analyses of US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data showed similarly distinct patterns between East Asian American and white American patients. Conclusion: Contrasting age-specific incidences and pathological characteristics of breast cancer between East Asian and American women, as well as between East Asian Americans and white Americans, suggests racial differences in the biology.",

Methods: The prospective randomized phase III ABCSG-28 POSYTIVE trial evaluated median survival comparing primary surgery followed by systemic therapy to primary systemic therapy in de novo stage IV breast cancer. Results: Between 2011 and 2015, 90 previously untreated stage IV breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to surgical resection of the primary tumor followed by systemic therapy (Arm A) or primary systemic therapy (Arm B) in Austria. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the primary study endpoint. Conclusion: The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Ninety patients (45 arm A, 45 arm B) were included; median follow-up was 37.5 months. Patients in the surgery arm had more cT3 breast cancer (22.2% vs 6.7%) and more cN2 staging (15.6% vs 4.4%).

MONARCH 3 is a randomized, phase III, double-blind study of abemaciclib/placebo (150 mg twice daily, continuous) plus nonsteroidal AI (1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily). A total of 493 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC with no prior systemic therapy in this setting were enrolled. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS (final analysis after 240 events); other endpoints included response and safety evaluations. Here we analyze the final PFS data and update secondary endpoints. The abemaciclib arm had a significantly longer median PFS than the placebo arm (28.18 versus 14.76 months; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.540 [0.418-0.698];   = .000002). The ORR was 61.0% in the abemaciclib arm versus 45.5% in the placebo arm (measurable disease,   = .003).

        "abstract": "Background: Adding cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced breast cancer but the impact of ethnicity on efficacy and toxicity is unclear. We aimed to estimate the relative treatment efficacy and toxicity of endocrine therapy with and without CDK4/6 inhibitors, and compare between Asian/non-Asian subgroups. Methods: This meta-analysis included published first-line randomized trials comparing CDK4/6 inhibitor-endocrine therapy versus endocrine monotherapy. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the overall population and Asian/non-Asian subgroups were extracted. The inverse-variance-weighted method was used to pool treatment estimates of PFS. Results: Four trials (N = 2499) were included. Patients received combination CDK4/6 inhibitor-endocrine therapy (N = 1441; ribociclib, [46.4%]; palbociclib, [30.8%]; or abemaciclib, [22.8%]) versus endocrine monotherapy (N = 1058). CDK4/6 inhibitor-endocrine therapy was associated with prolonged PFS compared with endocrine monotherapy (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.62). In Asians (N = 492), PFS HR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.29-0.51, P < 0.0001). In non-Asians (N = 2007), PFS HR was 0.62 (95% CI 0.54-0.71, P < 0.0001). There was a significant treatment-by-ethnicity interaction (P = 0.002). Toxicity data by ethnic subgroup were only available from two trials (n = 1334) with no convincing evidence that the risk of toxicity between CDK4/6 inhibitor-endocrine therapy and endocrine monotherapy varied by ethnicity. Conclusion: Adding CDK4/6 inhibitor to endocrine therapy prolongs PFS compared to endocrine therapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced breast cancer. The magnitude of PFS benefit is ethnicity-dependent but there is no interethnic differences in relative treatment-related toxicities. These findings may assist in the design and interpretation of trials, inform economic analyses, and stimulate pharmacogenomic research.",

        "abstract": "Background: The majority of breast cancers (BCs) are characterized by the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα+). ERα acts as ligand-dependent transcription factor for genes associated with cell survival, proliferation, and tumor growth. Thus, blocking the estrogen agonist effect on ERα is the main strategy in the treatment of ERα+ BCs. However, despite the development of targeted anti-estrogen therapies for ER+ BC, around 30-50% of early breast cancer patients will relapse. Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy is a great challenge in ER+ BC patient treatment. Methods: Anti-estrogen resistance is a consequence of molecular changes, which allow for tumor growth irrespective of estrogen presence. Those changes may be associated with ERα modifications either at the genetic, regulatory or protein level. Additionally, the activation of alternate growth pathways and/or cell survival mechanisms can lead to estrogen-independence and endocrine resistance. Results: This comprehensive review summarizes molecular mechanisms associated with resistance to anti-estrogen therapy, focusing on genetic alterations, stress responses, cell survival mechanisms, and cell reprogramming.",

We report the results of a prespecified analysis of overall survival. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progression or relapse during previous endocrine therapy to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. We analyzed overall survival; the effect of palbociclib according to the prespecified stratification factors of presence or absence of sensitivity to endocrine therapy, presence or absence of visceral metastatic disease, and menopausal status; the efficacy of subsequent therapies after disease progression; and safety. Results: Among 521 patients who underwent randomization, the median overall survival was 34.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.8 to 40.0) in the palbociclib-fulvestrant group and 28.0 months (95% CI, 23.6 to 34.6) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for death, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.03; P=0.09; absolute difference, 6.9 months). CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment after the completion of the trial regimen occurred in 16% of the patients in the placebo-fulvestrant group. Among 410 patients with sensitivity to previous endocrine therapy, the median overall survival was 39.7 months (95% CI, 34.8 to 45.7) in the palbociclib-fulvestrant group and 29.7 months (95% CI, 23.8 to 37.9) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.94; absolute difference, 10.0 months). The median duration of subsequent therapy was similar in the two groups, and the median time to the receipt of chemotherapy was 17.6 months in the palbociclib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 8.8 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.73; P<0.001). No new safety signals were observed with 44.8 months of follow-up. Conclusion: Among patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had sensitivity to previous endocrine therapy, treatment with palbociclib-fulvestrant resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with placebo-fulvestrant. The differences in overall survival in the entire trial group were not significant. (Funded by Pfizer; PALOMA-3 ClinicalTrials.gov number,   .).",

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose To update key recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer guideline. Methods Based on the signals approach, an Expert Panel reviewed published literature and research survey results on the observed frequency of less common in situ hybridization (ISH) patterns to update the recommendations. Recommendations Two recommendations addressed via correspondence in 2015 are included. First, immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ is defined as invasive breast cancer with weak to moderate complete membrane staining observed in > 10% of tumor cells. Second, if the initial HER2 test result in a core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test may (not \"must\") be ordered on the excision specimen based on specific clinical criteria. The HER2 testing algorithm for breast cancer is updated to address the recommended work-up for less common clinical scenarios (approximately 5% of cases) observed when using a dual-probe ISH assay. These scenarios are described as ISH group 2 ( HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 [CEP17] ratio ≥ 2.0; average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals per cell), ISH group 3 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals per cell), and ISH group 4 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 signals per cell). The diagnostic approach includes more rigorous interpretation criteria for ISH and requires concomitant IHC review for dual-probe ISH groups 2 to 4 to arrive at the most accurate HER2 status designation (positive or negative) based on combined interpretation of the ISH and IHC assays. The Expert Panel recommends that laboratories using single-probe ISH assays include concomitant IHC review as part of the interpretation of all single-probe ISH assay results.

Methods: At initial diagnosis, patients were randomized 1:1 to either the LRT or ST group. All the patients were given ST either immediately after randomization or after surgical resection of the intact primary tumor. Results: The trial enrolled 274 patients: 138 in the LRT group and 136 in the ST group. Hazard of death was 34% lower in the LRT group than in the ST group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.88; p = 0.005). Unplanned subgroup analyses showed that the risk of death was statistically lower in the LRT group than in the ST group with respect to estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)(+) (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46-0.91; p = 0.01), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)/neu(-) (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.91; p = 0.01), patients younger than 55 years (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.38-0.86; p = 0.007), and patients with solitary bone-only metastases (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23-0.98; p = 0.04). Conclusion: In the current trial, improvement in 36-month survival was not observed with upfront surgery for stage IV breast cancer patients. However, a longer follow-up study (median, 40 months) showed statistically significant improvement in median survival. When locoregional treatment in de novo stage IV BC is discussed with the patient as an option, practitioners must consider age, performance status, comorbidities, tumor type, and metastatic disease burden.",

Clinical experience suggests that many women with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) relapse quickly. Expert oncologist discussed about new chemotherapeutic strategies and agents used in treatment of mTNBC and the expert group used data from published literature, practical experience and opinion of a large group of academic oncologists to arrive at this practical consensus recommendations for the benefit of community oncologists.",

        "abstract": "Background: The phase III MONALEESA-2 study demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and a manageable toxicity profile for first-line ribociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Here, we report updated efficacy and safety data, together with exploratory biomarker analyses, from the MONALEESA-2 study. Methods: A total of 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- recurrent/metastatic breast cancer were randomized (1 : 1; stratified by presence/absence of liver and/or lung metastases) to ribociclib (600 mg/day; 3-weeks-on/1-week-off; 28-day treatment cycles) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day; continuous) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was locally assessed PFS. The key secondary end point was overall survival (OS). Other secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Biomarker analysis was an exploratory end point. Results: At the time of the second interim analysis, the median duration of follow-up was 26.4 months. Median PFS was 25.3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 23.0-30.3] for ribociclib plus letrozole and 16.0 months (95% CI 13.4-18.2) for placebo plus letrozole (hazard ratio 0.568; 95% CI 0.457-0.704; log-rank P = 9.63 × 10-8). Ribociclib treatment benefit was maintained irrespective of PIK3CA or TP53 mutation status, total Rb, Ki67, or p16 protein expression, and CDKN2A, CCND1, or ESR1 mRNA levels. Ribociclib benefit was more pronounced in patients with wild-type versus altered receptor tyrosine kinase genes. OS data remain immature, with 116 deaths observed; 50 in the ribociclib arm and 66 in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.746; 95% CI 0.517-1.078). The ORR was 42.5% versus 28.7% for all patients treated with ribociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole, respectively, and 54.5% versus 38.8%, respectively, for patients with measurable disease. Safety results, after a further 11.1 months of follow-up, were comparable with those reported at the first analysis, with no new or unexpected toxicities observed, and no evidence of cumulative toxicity. Conclusion: The improved efficacy outcomes and manageable tolerability observed with first-line ribociclib plus letrozole are maintained with longer follow-up, relative to letrozole monotherapy.",

Most of the studies on TNBC were conducted in Western population and TNBC is reported to be more frequent in the African women. This review encapsulates the studies conducted on TNBC patients in Asian population and elucidates the similarities and differences between these two regions. The current treatment of TNBC includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In addition to the current chemotherapies, which mainly include cytotoxic agents, such as taxanes and anthracyclines, many clinical trials are investigating the potential use of other chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapeutics and combinational therapies to treat TNBC. Moreover, this review also integrates the studies involving novel markers, which will help us to dissect the pathologic process of TNBC and in turn facilitate the development of better treatment strategies to combat TNBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: To assess efficacy and safety of palbociclib plus fulvestrant in Asians with endocrine therapy-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Methods: The Palbociclib Ongoing Trials in the Management of Breast Cancer 3 (PALOMA-3) trial, a double-blind phase III study, included 521 patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with disease progression on endocrine therapy. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed on study treatment and at the end of treatment. Results: This preplanned subgroup analysis of the PALOMA-3 study included premenopausal and postmenopausal Asians taking palbociclib plus fulvestrant (n = 71) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 31). Palbociclib plus fulvestrant improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with fulvestrant alone. Median PFS was not reached with palbociclib plus fulvestrant (95% CI, 9.2 months to not reached) but was 5.8 months with placebo plus fulvestrant (95% CI, 3.5 to 9.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.270 to 0.869;   = .0065). The most common all-cause grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the palbociclib arm were neutropenia (92%) and leukopenia (29%); febrile neutropenia occurred in 4.1% of patients. Within-patient mean trough concentration comparisons across subgroups indicated similar palbociclib exposure between Asians and non-Asians. Global quality of life was maintained; no statistically significant changes from baseline were observed for patient-reported outcome scores with palbociclib plus fulvestrant. Conclusion: This is the first report, to our knowledge, showing that palbociclib plus fulvestrant improves PFS in asian patients. Palbociclib plus fulvestrant was well tolerated in this study.",

Patients and Methods MONARCH 2 was a global, double-blind, phase III study of women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who had progressed while receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), ≤ 12 months from the end of adjuvant ET, or while receiving first-line ET for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily) on a continuous schedule and fulvestrant (500 mg, per label). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), and key secondary end points included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, quality of life, and safety. Results Between August 2014 and December 2015, 669 patients were randomly assigned to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (n = 446) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 223). Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant significantly extended PFS versus fulvestrant alone (median, 16.4 v 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.553; 95% CI, 0.449 to 0.681; P < .001). In patients with measurable disease, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant achieved an ORR of 48.1% (95% CI, 42.6% to 53.6%) compared with 21.3% (95% CI, 15.1% to 27.6%) in the control arm. The most common adverse events in the abemaciclib versus placebo arms were diarrhea (86.4% v 24.7%), neutropenia (46.0% v 4.0%), nausea (45.1% v 22.9%), and fatigue (39.9% v 26.9%). Conclusions Abemaciclib at 150 mg twice daily plus fulvestrant was effective, significantly improving PFS and ORR and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who progressed while receiving ET.",

Mortality-to-incidence ratio was found to be as high as 66 in rural registries whereas as low as 8 in urban registries. Besides this young age has been found as a major risk factor for breast cancer in Indian women. Breast cancer projection for India during time periods 2020 suggests the number to go as high as 1797900.

In regions with scarce resources, fragile or fragmented health systems, cancer contributes to the cycle of poverty. Proven and cost-effective interventions are available for both these common cancers, yet for so many women access to these is beyond reach. These inequities highlight the urgent need in low-income and middle-income countries for sustainable investments in the entire continuum of cancer control, from prevention to palliative care, and in the development of high-quality population-based cancer registries. In this first paper of the Series on health, equity, and women's cancers, we describe the burden of breast and cervical cancer, with an emphasis on global and regional trends in incidence, mortality, and survival, and the consequences, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged women in different settings.",

        "abstract": "Background: The role of locoregional treatment in women with metastatic breast cancer at first presentation is unclear. Preclinical evidence suggests that such treatment might help the growth of metastatic disease, whereas many retrospective analyses in clinical cohorts have suggested a favourable effect of locoregional treatment in these patients. We aimed to compare the effect of locoregional treatment with no treatment on outcome in women with metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation. Methods: In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited previously untreated patients (≤65 years of age with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at least 1 year) presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast tumour and axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, by a computer-generated block randomisation sequence (block size of four). Randomisation was stratified by site of distant metastases, number of metastatic lesions, and hormone receptor status. Patients with resectable primary tumour in the breast that could be treated with endocrine therapy were randomly assigned upfront, whereas those with an unresectable primary tumour were planned for chemotherapy before randomisation. Of the patients who had chemotherapy before randomisation, we randomly assigned patients who had an objective tumour response after six to eight cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between Feb 7, 2005, and Jan 18, 2013, of the 716 women presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, we randomly assigned 350 patients: 173 to locoregional treatment and 177 to no locoregional treatment. At data cut-off of Nov 1, 2013, median follow-up was 23 months (IQR 12·2-38·7) with 235 deaths (locoregional treatment n=118, no locoregional treatment n=117). Median overall survival was 19·2 months (95% CI 15·98-22·46) in the locoregional treatment group and 20·5 months (16·96-23·98) in the no-locoregional treatment group (HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·81-1·34; p=0·79), and the corresponding 2-year overall survival was 41·9% (95% CI 33·9-49·7) in the locoregional treatment group and 43·0% (35·2-50·8) in the no locoregional treatment group. The only adverse event noted was wound infection related to surgery in one patient in the locoregional treatment group. Conclusion: There is no evidence to suggest that locoregional treatment of the primary tumour affects overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation who have responded to front-line chemotherapy, and this procedure should not be part of routine practice.",

        "abstract": "Background: Platinum chemotherapy has a role in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer but its full potential has probably not yet been reached. We assessed whether a cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen was non-inferior to or superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: For this open-label, randomised, phase 3, hybrid-designed trial undertaken at 12 institutions or hospitals in China, we included Chinese patients aged 18-70 years with previously untreated, histologically confirmed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and an ECOG performance status of 0-1. These patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either cisplatin plus gemcitabine (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) or paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) given intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of eight cycles. Randomisation was done centrally via an interactive web response system using block randomisation with a size of eight, with no stratification factors. Patients and investigator were aware of group assignments. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and analyses were based on all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was 1·2. If non-inferiority of cisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with paclitaxel plus gemcitabine was achieved, we would then test for superiority. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: From Jan 14, 2011, to Nov 14, 2013, 240 patients were assessed for eligibility and randomly assigned to treatment (120 in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 120 in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group). 236 patients received at least one dose of assigned chemotherapy and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (118 per group). After a median follow-up of 16·3 months (IQR 14·4-26·8) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 15·9 months (10·7-25·4) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0·692 (95% CI 0·523-0·915; pnon-inferiority<0·0001, psuperiority=0·009, thus cisplatin plus gemcitabine was both non-inferior to and superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Median progression-free survival was 7·73 months (95% CI 6·16-9·30) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 6·47 months (5·76-7·18) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that differed significantly between the two groups included nausea (eight [7%] vs one [<1%]), vomiting (13 [11%] vs one [<1%]), musculoskeletal pain (none vs ten [8%]), anaemia (39 [33%] vs six [5%]), and thrombocytopenia (38 [32%] vs three [3%]), for the cisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine groups, respectively. In addition, patients in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group had significantly fewer events of grade 1-4 alopecia (12 [10%] vs 42 [36%]) and peripheral neuropathy (27 [23%] vs 60 [51%]), but more grade 1-4 anorexia (33 [28%] vs 10 [8%]), constipation (29 [25%] vs 11 [9%]), hypomagnesaemia (27 [23%] vs five [4%]), and hypokalaemia (10 [8%] vs two [2%]). Serious drug-related adverse events were seen in three patients in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group (interstitial pneumonia, anaphylaxis, and severe neutropenia) and four in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group (pathological bone fracture, thrombocytopenia with subcutaneous haemorrhage, severe anaemia, and cardiogenic syncope). There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: Cisplatin plus gemcitabine could be an alternative or even the preferred first-line chemotherapy strategy for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",

In this single-arm, phase II study ( ), we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of cisplatin and gemcitabine (GP) as the first-line therapy in mTNBC. Eligible women were those who had measurable disease with no prior chemotherapy for mTNBC. All patients received 21-day-cycle of cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) on days 1-3 and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or up to 8 cycles. BRCA1/2 mutation status and immunohistochemical basal markers were included in the correlative studies. Sixty-four patients with the median age of 49 years were enrolled. Thirty patients (46.9%) had ≤1 year from diagnosis to recurrence. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.2 months (95%CI, 5.6-8.9 months) and overall survival (OS) was 19.1 months (95%CI, 12.4-25.8 months) with median follow-up 42 months. Patients received treatment for a median of six cycles. The overall response rate was 62.5%. The most common grades 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (42.2%), thrombocytopenia (29.7%), anemia (18.8%) and nausea/vomiting (15.6%).No specific BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were identified. The efficacy of responses and basal-like subtype were independent favorable factors for PFS and OS, respectively. We conclude that the combination of GP has significant activity and a favorable safety profile as the first-line chemotherapy in mTNBC patients, in particular patients with basal-like subtype. The promising role of this combination as the front-line treatment for mTNBC continued to be evaluated in our ongoing phase III trial (CBCSG006).",

Methods: The study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase III trial. Patients MBC with who achieved disease control after six cycles of PG chemotherapy were randomly assigned to maintenance chemotherapy or observation until progression. Results: Of 324 patients from 10 centers enrolled, 231 patients with MBC exhibited disease control (complete response + partial response + stable disease) with first-line PG and were randomly assigned to maintenance chemotherapy (n = 116) or observation (n = 115). The median age was 48 years (range, 28 to 76 years), median follow-up was 33 months, and median number of chemotherapy cycles in the maintenance group after random assignment was six.

Methods: LEAP is a worldwide, single-arm, open-label study. HER2-positive, locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with progression after an anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab were eligible. Patients received capecitabine 2000 mg/m(2) daily in two divided doses, days 1-14, every 21 days and lapatinib 1250 mg once daily. Results: Among 186 patients enrolled in 6 Korean centers, 58 had BM. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.7 weeks in patients with BM and 19.4 weeks without BM (P = 0.88). In patients with BM, brain response was synchronized with systemic responses (P = 0.0001). Overall survival (OS) was 48.9 weeks in patients with BM and 64.6 weeks without BM (P = 0.23). Multivariable analysis found hormone receptor positivity (P = 0.003) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of combined systemic and brain disease (P < 0.0001) significantly associated with prolonged brain PFS, and CBR of combined systemic and brain disease (P = 0.03) and longer trastuzumab use (P = 0.047) associated with prolonged OS in patients with BM; prior capecitabine did not affect PFS or OS in patients with BM. Conclusion: Lapatinib plus capecitabine is equally effective in patients with or without BM.",

        "abstract": "Background: This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with standard chemotherapy regimens versus chemotherapy alone as second-line treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to chemotherapy + bevacizumab or to chemotherapy + placebo. Before random assignment, investigators chose capecitabine, a taxane (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or docetaxel), gemcitabine, or vinorelbine. Dosing for bevacizumab or placebo was 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, depending on chemotherapy regimen. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, PFS by chemotherapy cohort, objective response rate (ORR), duration of objective response, 1-year survival rate, and safety. Results: RIBBON-2 enrolled 684 patients (225, chemotherapy + placebo; 459, chemotherapy + bevacizumab). The combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant benefit. Median PFS increased from 5.1 to 7.2 months (stratified hazard ratio for PFS, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.93; P = .0072). The 10% improvement in ORR between the placebo- and bevacizumab-containing arms (39.5% v 29.6%; P = .0193), although not statistically significant, was consistent with previous trials. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) related to bevacizumab treatment were hypertension (9.0%) and proteinuria (3.1%). There was an increased number of AEs leading to study discontinuation in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy + placebo arm (13.3% v 7.2%). Conclusion: The combination of bevacizumab with commonly used chemotherapies improved PFS in the second-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, with a safety profile comparable with that in prior phase III studies.",

This single-arm open-label trial (EGF109491;  ) was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with capecitabine in 52 heavily pretreated Chinese patients with HER2-positive MBC. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DoR), central nervous system (CNS) as first site of relapse, and safety. The results showed that there were 23 patients with partial responses and 7 patients with stable disease, resulting in a CBR of 57.7%. The median PFS was 6.34 months (95% confidence interval, 4.93-9.82 months). The median TTR and DoR were 4.07 months (range, 0.03-14.78 months) and 6.93 months (range, 1.45-9.72 months), respectively. Thirteen (25.0%) patients had new lesions as disease progression. Among them, 2 (3.8%) patients had CNS disease reported as the first relapse. The most common toxicities were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (59.6%), diarrhea (48.1%), rash (48.1%), hyperbilirubinemia (34.6%), and fatigue (30.8%). Exploratory analyses of oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA suggested that of 38 patients providing a tumor sample, baseline PIK3CA mutation status was not associated with CBR (P = 0.639) or PFS (P = 0.989). These data confirm that the lapatinib plus capecitabine combination is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for Chinese women with heavily pretreated MBC, irrespective of PIK3CA status.",

A cohort of 26,767 breast cancer patients were divided in four groups: luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+ HER2+), HER2+ (ER-, PR-, HER2+), and triple-negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-). Clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. The luminal A (14,437 patients, 53.9%) subtype was the largest in our study. Compared with luminal A subtype, TNBC correlated with younger age, more aggressive characteristics and poor overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. The hazard rate showed a peak at 24 months for the TNBC subtype, but after 60 months, risk was similar to that of the luminal A subtype. Higher T, N stage and histologic grade, and lymphatic and vascular invasion showed poor prognosis in TNBC patients, but on multivariate analysis only histologic grade and ki-67 status were related. Young age was related to poor prognosis in the luminal A subtype, however, age was not related to prognosis in the TNBC subtype. Of the 5,586 TNBC patients, 282 patients (7.11%) expired within 3 years of diagnosis. T and N stage and grade were significantly associated with prognosis on multivariate analysis. TNBC subtype is characterized by younger age with poorer outcome. However, younger age is not related to prognosis, and mortality risk decreases to that of the luminal A subtype, which is known to have the best prognosis after a few years.",

Methods: To compare and contrast male and female breast cancers, we obtained case and population data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for breast cancers diagnosed from 1973 through 2005. Standard descriptive epidemiology was supplemented with age-period-cohort models and breast cancer survival analyses. Results: Of all breast cancers, men with breast cancer make up less than 1%. Male compared with female breast cancers occurred later in life with higher stage, lower grade, and more estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Recent breast cancer incidence and mortality rates declined over time for men and women, but these trends were greater for women than for men. Comparing patients diagnosed from 1996 through 2005 versus 1976 through 1985, and adjusting for age, stage, and grade, cause-specific hazard rates for breast cancer death declined by 28% among men (P = .03) and by 42% among women (P approximately 0). Conclusion: There were three intriguing results. Age-specific incidence patterns showed that the biology of male breast cancer resembled that of late-onset female breast cancer. Similar breast cancer incidence trends among men and women suggested that there are common breast cancer risk factors that affect both sexes, especially estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Finally, breast cancer mortality and survival rates have improved significantly over time for both male and female breast cancer, but progress for men has lagged behind that for women.",

        "abstract": "Background: Surgical or medical castration and antiestrogenic treatment with tamoxifen are common endocrine treatments for premenopausal women with breast cancer. However, tamoxifen therapy induces high levels of plasma estradiol, with unknown long-term effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining estrogen suppression with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin and estradiol receptor blockade with tamoxifen to determine whether the high estradiol levels induced by tamoxifen could be reduced and whether the antitumor effects would be better. Methods: In a three-arm, randomized, prospective trial, from 1988 through 1995, a total of 161 premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with buserelin, tamoxifen, or both. Patients with steroid receptor-negative tumors or with tumors of unknown receptor status who had a disease-free interval of less than 2 years were excluded. The median follow-up was 7.3 years, during which 76% of the patients died, all of breast cancer. Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced among treatment groups. All P values are from two-sided tests. Results: Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen was superior to treatment with buserelin or tamoxifen alone by objective response rate (48%, 34%, and 28% of patients who could be evaluated, respectively; P =.11 [chi(2) test]), median progression-free survival (9.7 months, 6.3 months, and 5.6 months; P =.03), and overall survival (3.7 years, 2.5 years, and 2.9 years; P =.01). Actuarial 5-year survival percentages were 34.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.4%-48.0%), 14.9% (95% CI = 3.9%-25.9%), and 18.4% (95% CI = 7.0%-29.8%), respectively. No differences in antitumor effects were observed between single-agent treatment groups. During combined treatment or treatment with buserelin alone, plasma estradiol levels were suppressed equally; in contrast, during treatment with tamoxifen alone, plasma estradiol levels increased threefold to fourfold over pretreatment levels. Conclusion: Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen was more effective and resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with either drug alone.",

We employed the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) clinical validity framework to assess the strength of evidence between selected genes and breast or ovarian cancer. Methods: Thirty-one genes offered on cancer panel testing were selected for evaluation. The strength of gene-disease relationship was systematically evaluated and a clinical validity classification of either Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Limited, Refuted, Disputed, or No Reported Evidence was assigned. Results: Definitive clinical validity classifications were made for 10/31 and 10/32 gene-disease pairs for breast and ovarian cancer respectively. Two genes had a Moderate classification whereas, 6/31 and 6/32 genes had Limited classifications for breast and ovarian cancer respectively. Contradictory evidence resulted in Disputed or Refuted assertions for 9/31 genes for breast and 4/32 genes for ovarian cancer. No Reported Evidence of disease association was asserted for 5/31 genes for breast and 11/32 for ovarian cancer. Conclusion: Evaluation of gene-disease association using the ClinGen clinical validity framework revealed a wide range of classifications.

Mutations in two high susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 explain around 25 % of familial breast cancers, while other high, moderate and low susceptibility genes explain up to 20 % more of breast cancer families. Thus, it is important to decipher the genetic architecture of families that show no mutations to improve genetic counselling. The comprehensive description of familial breast cancer using different techniques and platforms has shown to be very valuable for better patient diagnosis, tumour surveillance, and ultimately patient treatment. This review focuses on the complex landscape of pathological, protein, genetic and genomic features associated with BRCA1-, BRCA2-, and non-BRCA1/BRCA2-related cancers described up to date. Special emphasis deserves the coexistence of distinct molecular breast cancer subtypes, the development of tumour classifiers to predict BRCA1/2 mutations, and the last insights from recent whole genome sequencing studies and miRNA profiling.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population of Israel, 11% of breast cancer and 40% of ovarian cancer are due to three inherited founder mutations in the cancer predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. For carriers of these mutations, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Population screening for these mutations among AJ women may be justifiable if accurate estimates of cancer risk for mutation carriers can be obtained. We therefore undertook to determine risks of breast and ovarian cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers ascertained irrespective of personal or family history of cancer. Families harboring mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were ascertained by identifying mutation carriers among healthy AJ males recruited from health screening centers and outpatient clinics. Female relatives of the carriers were then enrolled and genotyped. Among the female relatives with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, cumulative risk of developing either breast or ovarian cancer by age 60 and 80, respectively, were 0.60 (± 0.07) and 0.83 (± 0.07) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.33 (± 0.09) and 0.76 (± 0.13) for BRCA2 carriers. Risks were higher in recent vs. earlier birth cohorts (P = 0.006). High cancer risks in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers identified through healthy males provide an evidence base for initiating a general screening program in the AJ population. General screening would identify many carriers who are not evaluated by genetic testing based on family history criteria. Such a program could serve as a model to investigate implementation and outcomes of population screening for genetic predisposition to cancer in other populations.",

Methods: We used a panel of 34 putative susceptibility genes to perform sequencing on samples from 60,466 women with breast cancer and 53,461 controls. In separate analyses for protein-truncating variants and rare missense variants in these genes, we estimated odds ratios for breast cancer overall and tumor subtypes. We evaluated missense-variant associations according to domain and classification of pathogenicity. Results: Protein-truncating variants in 5 genes ( ,  ,  ,  , and  ) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.0001. Protein-truncating variants in 4 other genes ( ,  ,  , and  ) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.05 and a Bayesian false-discovery probability of less than 0.05. For protein-truncating variants in 19 of the remaining 25 genes, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio for breast cancer overall was less than 2.0. For protein-truncating variants in   and  , odds ratios were higher for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease than for ER-negative disease; for protein-truncating variants in  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , odds ratios were higher for ER-negative disease than for ER-positive disease. Rare missense variants (in aggregate) in  ,  , and   were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.001. For  ,  , and  , missense variants (in aggregate) that would be classified as pathogenic according to standard criteria were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall, with the risk being similar to that of protein-truncating variants. Conclusion: The results of this study define the genes that are most clinically useful for inclusion on panels for the prediction of breast cancer risk, as well as provide estimates of the risks associated with protein-truncating variants, to guide genetic counseling.

        "abstract": "Background: Personal cancer diagnosis and family cancer history factor into which individuals should undergo genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Family history is often determined in the research setting through kindreds with disease clusters, or clinically from self-report. The population prevalence of individuals with diagnostic characteristics and/or family cancer history meeting criteria for HBOC testing is unknown. Methods: Utilizing Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data and a research resource linking registry records to genealogies, the Utah Population Database, the population-based prevalence of diagnostic and family history characteristics meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for HBOC testing was objectively assessed. Results: Among Utah residents with an incident breast cancer diagnosis 2010-2015 and evaluable for family history, 21.6% met criteria for testing based on diagnostic characteristics, but the proportion increased to 62.9% when family history was evaluated. The proportion of cases meeting testing criteria at diagnosis was 94% for ovarian cancer, 23% for prostate cancer, and 51.1% for pancreatic cancer. Among an unaffected Utah population of approximately 1.7 million evaluable for family history, 197,601 or 11.6% met testing criteria based on family history. Conclusion: This study quantifies the population-based prevalence of HBOC criteria using objectively determined genealogy and cancer incidence data. Sporadic breast cancer likely represents a portion of the high prevalence of family cancer history seen in this study. These results underline the importance of establishing presence of a deleterious mutation in an affected family member, per NCCN guidelines, before testing unaffected relatives.",

        "abstract": "Background: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer, with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females. Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45% of familial breast cancer and 90% of inherited breast/ovarian cancer, whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases. Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified, with the majority resulting in protein truncation. A specific BRCA1 mutation, 185delAG, has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0.9% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype. The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 (ref. 8), as well as in three Ashkenazi male breast cancer patients. We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer. BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3,000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1.09% for the 185delAG mutation and 0.13% for the 5382insC mutation. BRCA2 analysis on 3,085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1.52% for the 6174delT mutation. This expanded population-based study confirms that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary breast cancer among the Ashkenazim, and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2.",

In Iceland, deCODE Genetics has emphasised the importance of returning results to research participants, particularly the founder pathogenic BRCA2 variant; NM_000059.3:c.771_775del. To do so, they opened the website www.arfgerd.is . Individuals who received positive results via the website were offered genetic counselling (GC) at Landspitali in Reykjavik. At the end of May 2019, over 46.000 (19% of adults of Icelandic origin) had registered at the website and 352 (0.77%) received text message informing them about their positive results. Of those, 195 (55%) contacted the GC unit. Additionally, 129 relatives asked for GC and confirmatory testing, a total of 324 individuals. Various information such as gender and age, prior knowledge of the variant and perceived emotional impact, was collected. Of the BRCA2 positive individuals from the website, 74 (38%) had prior knowledge of the pathogenic variant (PV) in the family. The majority initially stated worries, anxiety or other negative emotion but later in the process many communicated gratitude for the knowledge gained. Males represented 41% of counsellees as opposed to less than 30% in the regular hereditary breast and ovarian (HBOC) clinic. It appears that counselling in clinical settings was more reassuring for worried counsellees. In this article, we describe one-year experience of the GC service to those who received positive results via the website. This experience offers a unique opportunity to study the public response of a successful method of the return of genetic results from research.",

Here, we determine the clinical utility of identifying actionable variants in a healthy cohort of women. Methods: Germline DNA from a subset of healthy Australian women participating in the lifepool project was screened using an 11-gene custom sequencing panel. Women with clinically actionable results were invited to attend a familial cancer clinic (FCC) for post-test genetic counseling and confirmatory testing. Outcomes measured included the prevalence of pathogenic variants, and the uptake rate of genetic counseling, risk reduction surgery, and cascade testing. Results: Thirty-eight of 5908 women (0.64%) carried a clinically actionable pathogenic variant. Forty-two percent of pathogenic variant carriers did not have a first-degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer and 89% pursued referral to an FCC. Forty-six percent (6/13) of eligible women pursued risk reduction surgery, and the uptake rate of cascade testing averaged 3.3 family members per index case. Conclusion: Within our cohort, HBOC genetic testing was well accepted, and the majority of high-risk gene carriers identified would not meet eligibility criteria for genetic testing based on their existing family history.",

This manuscript focuses on cancer risk and risk management for BRCA-related breast/ovarian cancer syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Carriers of a BRCA1/2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant have an excessive risk for both breast and ovarian cancer that warrants consideration of more intensive screening and preventive strategies. There is also evidence that risks of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer are elevated in these carriers. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a highly penetrant cancer syndrome associated with a high lifetime risk for cancer, including soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, premenopausal breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, and brain tumors.",

However, consensus around the policy of \"defer-when-possible\" obscures the extent to which this norm is currently under siege. Increasingly, routine use of full or partial genome sequencing challenges our ability to control what is discovered in childhood or, when applied in a prenatal context, even before birth. The expansion of consumer-initiated genetic testing services challenges our ability to restrict what is available to minors. As the barriers to access crumble, medical professionals should proceed with caution, bearing in mind potential risks and continuing to assess the impact of genetic testing on this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fifty years after the recognition of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), our perception of cancers related to germline alterations of TP53 has drastically changed: (i) germline TP53 alterations are often identified among children with cancers, in particular soft-tissue sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, central nervous system tumours, or among adult females with early breast cancers, without familial history. This justifies the expansion of the LFS concept to a wider cancer predisposition syndrome designated heritable TP53-related cancer (hTP53rc) syndrome; (ii) the interpretation of germline TP53 variants remains challenging and should integrate epidemiological, phenotypical, bioinformatics prediction, and functional data; (iii) the penetrance of germline disease-causing TP53 variants is variable, depending both on the type of variant (dominant-negative variants being associated with a higher cancer risk) and on modifying factors; (iv) whole-body MRI (WBMRI) allows early detection of tumours in variant carriers and (v) in cancer patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, radiotherapy, and conventional genotoxic chemotherapy contribute to the development of subsequent primary tumours. It is critical to perform TP53 testing before the initiation of treatment in order to avoid in carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies. In children, the recommendations are to perform clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months, annual WBMRI and brain MRI from the first year of life, if the TP53 variant is known to be associated with childhood cancers. In adults, the surveillance should include every year clinical examination, WBMRI, breast MRI in females from 20 until 65 years and brain MRI until 50 years.",

Methods: We carried out three nested case-control studies in screened populations with 1112 matched case-control pairs. We examined the association of the measured percentage of density in the baseline mammogram with risk of breast cancer, according to method of cancer detection, time since the initiation of screening, and age. Results: As compared with women with density in less than 10% of the mammogram, women with density in 75% or more had an increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 7.4), whether detected by screening (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.2) or less than 12 months after a negative screening examination (odds ratio, 17.8; 95% CI, 4.8 to 65.9). Increased risk of breast cancer, whether detected by screening or other means, persisted for at least 8 years after study entry and was greater in younger than in older women. For women younger than the median age of 56 years, 26% of all breast cancers and 50% of cancers detected less than 12 months after a negative screening test were attributable to density in 50% or more of the mammogram. Conclusion: Extensive mammographic density is strongly associated with the risk of breast cancer detected by screening or between screening tests.

        "abstract": "Background: Multiple studies in the first decade of the 21  century have established contrast-enhanced breast MRI as a screening modality for women with a hereditary or familial increased risk for the development of breast cancer. In recent studies, in women with various risk profiles, the sensitivity ranges between 81% and 100%, which is approximately twice as high as the sensitivity of mammography. The specificity increases in follow-up rounds to around 97%, with positive predictive values for biopsy in the same range as for mammography. MRI preferentially detects the more aggressive/invasive types of breast cancer, but has a higher sensitivity than mammography for any type of cancer. This performance implies that in women screened with breast MRI, all other examinations must be regarded as supplemental. Mammography may yield ~5% additional cancers, mostly ductal carcinoma in situ, while slightly decreasing specificity and increasing the costs. Ultrasound has no supplemental value when MRI is used. Evidence is mounting that in other groups of women the performance of MRI is likewise superior to more conventional screening techniques. Particularly in women with a personal history of breast cancer, the gain seems to be high, but also in women with a biopsy history of lobular carcinoma in situ and even women at average risk, similar results are reported. Initial outcome studies show that breast MRI detects cancer earlier, which induces a stage-shift increasing the survival benefit of screening. Cost-effectiveness is still an issue, particularly for women at lower risk. Since costs of the MRI scan itself are a driving factor, efforts to reduce these costs are essential. The use of abbreviated MRI protocols may enable more widespread use of breast MRI for screening. Level of Evidence: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 5 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:377-390.",

Methods: Between 2004 and 2016, we prospectively enrolled 295 women, including 157 mutation carriers (75  , 61  ); participants' mean age at entry was 43.3 years. Seventeen cancers were later diagnosed: 4 ductal carcinoma   (DCIS) and 13 early-stage invasive breast cancers. Fifteen cancers occurred in mutation carriers (11  , 3  , 1  ). Median size of the invasive cancers was 0.61 cm. No patients had lymph node metastasis at time of diagnosis, and no interval invasive cancers occurred. The sensitivity of biannual MRI alone was 88.2% and annual MG plus biannual MRI was 94.1%. The cancer detection rate of biannual MRI alone was 0.7% per 100 screening episodes, which is similar to the cancer detection rate of 0.7% per 100 screening episodes for annual MG plus biannual MRI.

Methods: Prospective multicenter observational cohort study. Six hundred eighty-seven asymptomatic women at elevated familial risk (> or = 20% lifetime) underwent 1,679 annual screening rounds consisting of CBE, mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, read independently and in different combinations. In a subgroup of 371 women, additional half-yearly ultrasound and CBE was performed more than 869 screening rounds. Mean and median follow-up was 29.18 and 29.09 months. Results: Twenty-seven women were diagnosed with breast cancer: 11 ductal carcinoma in situ (41%) and 16 invasive cancers (59%). Three (11%) of 27 were node positive. All cancers were detected during annual screening; no interval cancer occurred; no cancer was identified during half-yearly ultrasound. The cancer yield of ultrasound (6.0 of 1,000) and mammography (5.4 of 1,000) was equivalent; it increased nonsignificantly (7.7 of 1,000) if both methods were combined. Cancer yield achieved by MRI alone (14.9 of 1,000) was significantly higher; it was not significantly improved by adding mammography (MRI plus mammography: 16.0 of 1,000) and did not change by adding ultrasound (MRI plus ultrasound: 14.9 of 1,000). Positive predictive value was 39% for mammography, 36% for ultrasound, and 48% for MRI. Conclusion: In women at elevated familial risk, quality-assured MRI screening shifts the distribution of screen-detected breast cancers toward the preinvasive stage. In women undergoing quality-assured MRI annually, neither mammography, nor annual or half-yearly ultrasound or CBE will add to the cancer yield achieved by MRI alone.",

Methods: In a single-center, prospective, nonrandomized comparison study, BRCA mutation carriers and women with a high familial risk (> 20% lifetime risk) for breast cancer were offered screening with mammography, ultrasound, and MRI every 12 months. Diagnostic performance was compared between individual modalities and their combinations. Further comparisons were based on subpopulations dichotomized by screening rounds, mutation status, age, and breast density. Results: There were 559 women with 1,365 complete imaging rounds included in this study. The sensitivity of MRI (90.0%) was significantly higher (P < .001) than that of mammography (37.5%) and ultrasound (37.5%). Of 40 cancers, 18 (45.0%) were detected by MRI alone. Two cancers were found by mammography alone (a ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] with microinvasion and a DCIS with < 10-mm invasive areas). This did not lead to a significant increase of sensitivity compared with using MRI alone (P = .15). No cancers were detected by ultrasound alone. Similarly, of 14 DCISs, all were detected by MRI, whereas mammography and ultrasound each detected five DCISs (35.7%). Age, mutation status, and breast density had no influence on the sensitivity of MRI and did not affect the superiority of MRI over mammography and ultrasound. Conclusion: MRI allows early detection of familial breast cancer regardless of patient age, breast density, or risk status. The added value of mammography is limited, and there is no added value of ultrasound in women undergoing MRI for screening.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging method for breast cancer detection and is therefore offered as a screening technique to women at increased risk of developing breast cancer. However, mammography is currently added from the age of 30 without proven benefits. The purpose of this study is to investigate the added cancer detection of mammography when breast MRI is available, focusing on the value in women with and without BRCA mutation, and in the age groups above and below 50 years. Methods: This retrospective single-center study evaluated 6553 screening rounds in 2026 women at increased risk of breast cancer (1 January 2003 to 1 January 2014). Risk category (BRCA mutation versus others at increased risk of breast cancer), age at examination, recall, biopsy, and histopathological diagnosis were recorded. Cancer yield, false positive recall rate (FPR), and false positive biopsy rate (FPB) were calculated using generalized estimating equations for separate age categories (< 40, 40-50, 50-60, ≥ 60 years). Numbers of screens needed to detect an additional breast cancer with mammography (NSN) were calculated for the subgroups. Results: Of a total of 125 screen-detected breast cancers, 112 were detected by MRI and 66 by mammography: 13 cancers were solely detected by mammography, including 8 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ. In BRCA mutation carriers, 3 of 61 cancers were detected only on mammography, while in other women 10 of 64 cases were detected with mammography alone. While 77% of mammography-detected-only cancers were detected in women ≥ 50 years of age, mammography also added more to the FPR in these women. Below 50 years the number of mammographic examinations needed to find an MRI-occult cancer was 1427. Conclusion: Mammography is of limited added value in terms of cancer detection when breast MRI is available for women of all ages who are at increased risk. While the benefit appears slightly larger in women over 50 years of age without BRCA mutation, there is also a substantial increase in false positive findings in these women.",

        "abstract": "Background: We investigated the additional contribution of mammography to screening accuracy in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers screened with MRI at different ages using individual patient data from six high-risk screening trials. Methods: Sensitivity and specificity of MRI, mammography and the combination of these tests were compared stratified for BRCA mutation and age using generalised linear mixed models with random effect for studies. Number of screens needed (NSN) for additional mammography-only detected cancer was estimated. Results: In BRCA1/2 mutation carriers of all ages (BRCA1 = 1,219 and BRCA2 = 732), adding mammography to MRI did not significantly increase screening sensitivity (increased by 3.9% in BRCA1 and 12.6% in BRCA2 mutation carriers, P > 0.05). However, in women with BRCA2 mutation younger than 40 years, one-third of breast cancers were detected by mammography only. Number of screens needed for mammography to detect one breast cancer not detected by MRI was much higher for BRCA1 compared with BRCA2 mutation carriers at initial and repeat screening. Conclusion: Additional screening sensitivity from mammography above that from MRI is limited in BRCA1 mutation carriers, whereas mammography contributes to screening sensitivity in BRCA2 mutation carriers, especially those ⩽ 40 years. The evidence from our work highlights that a differential screening schedule by BRCA status is worth considering.",

Methods: To assess the cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening strategies for women with a 20% or more familial risk for breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 or TP53 variant. Results: In this economic evaluation, conducted from February 1, 2019, to May 25, 2020, microsimulation modeling was used to estimate costs and effectiveness on a lifetime horizon from age 25 years until death of MRI screening among a cohort of 10 million Dutch women with a 20% or more familial risk for breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 or TP53 variant. A Dutch screening setting was modeled. Most data were obtained from the randomized Familial MRI Screening (FaMRIsc) trial, which included Dutch women aged 30 to 55 years. A health care payer perspective was applied. Conclusion: Several screening protocols with varying ages and intervals including those of the randomized FaMRIsc trial, consisting of the mammography (Mx) protocol (annual mammography and clinical breast examination) and the MRI protocol (annual MRI and clinical breast examination plus biennial mammography).",

        "abstract": "Background: Although physical activity is associated with lower breast cancer risk for average-risk women, it is not known if this association applies to women at high familial/genetic risk. We examined the association of recreational physical activity (self-reported by questionnaire) with breast cancer risk using the Prospective Family Study Cohort, which is enriched with women who have a breast cancer family history (  = 15,550). We examined associations of adult and adolescent recreational physical activity (quintiles of age-adjusted total metabolic equivalents per week) with breast cancer risk using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, and body mass index. We tested for multiplicative interactions of physical activity with predicted absolute breast cancer familial risk based on pedigree data and with   and   mutation status. Baseline recreational physical activity level in the highest four quintiles compared with the lowest quintile was associated with a 20% lower breast cancer risk (HR, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.93). The association was not modified by familial risk or   mutation status (  interactions >0.05). No overall association was found for adolescent recreational physical activity. Recreational physical activity in adulthood may lower breast cancer risk for women across the spectrum of familial risk. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that physical activity might reduce breast cancer risk by about 20% for women across the risk continuum, including women at higher-than-average risk due to their family history or genetic susceptibility. .",

        "abstract": "Background: The association between body mass index (BMI) and risk of breast cancer depends on time of life, but it is unknown whether this association depends on a woman's familial risk. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of a cohort enriched for familial risk consisting of 16,035 women from 6701 families in the Breast Cancer Family Registry and the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer followed for up to 20 years (mean 10.5 years). There were 896 incident breast cancers (mean age at diagnosis 55.7 years). We used Cox regression to model BMI risk associations as a function of menopausal status, age, and underlying familial risk based on pedigree data using the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), all measured at baseline. Results: The strength and direction of the BMI risk association depended on baseline menopausal status (P < 0.001); after adjusting for menopausal status, the association did not depend on age at baseline (P = 0.6). In terms of absolute risk, the negative association with BMI for premenopausal women has a much smaller influence than the positive association with BMI for postmenopausal women. Women at higher familial risk have a much larger difference in absolute risk depending on their BMI than women at lower familial risk. Conclusion: The greater a woman's familial risk, the greater the influence of BMI on her absolute postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Given that age-adjusted BMI is correlated across adulthood, maintaining a healthy weight throughout adult life is particularly important for women with a family history of breast cancer.",

No large prospective studies, however, have examined whether the number and timing of pregnancies are associated with BC risk for   and   mutation carriers. Methods: Using weighted and time-varying Cox proportional hazards models, we investigated whether reproductive events are associated with BC risk for mutation carriers using a retrospective cohort (5707   and 3525   mutation carriers) and a prospective cohort (2276   and 1610   mutation carriers), separately for each cohort and the combined prospective and retrospective cohort. Results: For   mutation carriers, there was no overall association with parity compared with nulliparity (combined hazard ratio [HR ] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.18). Relative to being uniparous, an increased number of FTPs was associated with decreased BC risk (HR  = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.91; HR  = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59 to 0.82; HR  = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.63, for 2, 3, and ≥4 FTPs, respectively,     < .0001) and increasing duration of breastfeeding was associated with decreased BC risk (combined cohort     = .0003). Relative to being nulliparous, uniparous   mutation carriers were at increased BC risk in the prospective analysis (prospective hazard ration [HR ] = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.62). For   mutation carriers, being parous was associated with a 30% increase in BC risk (HR  = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.69), and there was no apparent decrease in risk associated with multiparity except for having at least 4 FTPs vs. 1 FTP (HR  = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.98).

Numerous factors have been hypothesized to modify these risks, but studies are of variable quality, and it remains unclear which of these may be of value in clinical risk assessment. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for articles published through September 2013. Fixed effects meta-analysis was done using the hazard ratios and/or odds ratios to estimate the pooled effect estimates (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify factors that are associated with cancer risk modification in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Results: We identified 44 nonoverlapping studies that met predefined quality criteria. Sufficient evidence is available to make clinically relevant inferences about a number of cancer risk modifiers. The only variable examined that produced a probable association was late age at first live birth, a meta-analysis showed a decrease in the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers with women aged 30 years or older vs. women younger than 30 years (ES = 0.65; 95% CI =0.42 to 0.99). The same was shown for women aged 25 to 29 years versus those aged less than 25 years (ES = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.99). Breastfeeding and tubal ligation were associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers; oral contraceptives were associated with reduced risk among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Smoking was associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers only. Conclusion: Data assessing many potential risk modifiers are inadequate, and many have not been externally validated. Although additional studies are required to confirm some associations, sufficient information is available for some risk factors to be used in risk counseling or lifestyle modification to minimize cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers",

        "abstract": "Background: Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects. We bring together the epidemiological evidence, published and unpublished, on these associations, and review the relevant randomised evidence. Methods: Principal analyses used individual participant data from all eligible prospective studies that had sought information on the type and timing of MHT use; the main analyses are of individuals with complete information on this. Studies were identified by searching many formal and informal sources regularly from Jan 1, 1992, to Jan 1, 2018. Current users were included up to 5 years (mean 1·4 years) after last-reported MHT use. Logistic regression yielded adjusted risk ratios (RRs) comparing particular groups of MHT users versus never users. Results: During prospective follow-up, 108 647 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer at mean age 65 years (SD 7); 55 575 (51%) had used MHT. Among women with complete information, mean MHT duration was 10 years (SD 6) in current users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users, and mean age was 50 years (SD 5) at menopause and 50 years (SD 6) at starting MHT. Every MHT type, except vaginal oestrogens, was associated with excess breast cancer risks, which increased steadily with duration of use and were greater for oestrogen-progestagen than oestrogen-only preparations. Among current users, these excess risks were definite even during years 1-4 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 1·60, 95% CI 1·52-1·69; oestrogen-only RR 1·17, 1·10-1·26), and were twice as great during years 5-14 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 2·08, 2·02-2·15; oestrogen-only RR 1·33, 1·28-1·37). The oestrogen-progestagen risks during years 5-14 were greater with daily than with less frequent progestagen use (RR 2·30, 2·21-2·40 vs 1·93, 1·84-2·01; heterogeneity p<0·0001). For a given preparation, the RRs during years 5-14 of current use were much greater for oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours than for oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours, were similar for women starting MHT at ages 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, and 55-59 years, and were attenuated by starting after age 60 years or by adiposity (with little risk from oestrogen-only MHT in women who were obese). After ceasing MHT, some excess risk persisted for more than 10 years; its magnitude depended on the duration of previous use, with little excess following less than 1 year of MHT use. Conclusion: If these associations are largely causal, then for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase breast cancer incidence at ages 50-69 years by about one in every 50 users of oestrogen plus daily progestagen preparations; one in every 70 users of oestrogen plus intermittent progestagen preparations; and one in every 200 users of oestrogen-only preparations. The corresponding excesses from 10 years of MHT would be about twice as great.",

We assessed associations between various antidepressants and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. By using Danish nationwide registers, we identified all women (cases) aged 30-84 years with incident epithelial (serous, endometrioid, clear cell or mucinous) ovarian cancer during 2000-2011 (n = 4,103) and matched each case to 20 population controls (n = 58,706) by risk-set matching. Data on drug use (including tricyclic and related antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, other antidepressants, and potential confounder drugs), medical and reproductive history and socioeconomic parameters, were obtained from nationwide registries. We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for epithelial ovarian cancer associated with antidepressive drug use. Compared with non-use, use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96), whereas the associations for other antidepressants were close to unity [tricyclic and related antidepressants: OR, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.78-1.26); other antidepressants: OR, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.76-1.46)]. For individual types of SSRI, reduced ORs were observed for citalopram OR, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66-0.93), paroxetine 0.79 (95% CI, 0.56-1.12) and sertraline 0.80 (95% CI, 0.60-1.08). Among postmenopausal women, the inverse association was restricted to users of menopausal hormone therapy. In conclusion, use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated with a decreased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer; thereby implying potential chemopreventive properties of these drugs.",

Methods: Breast camcer risk associations were estimated from OCP data on 6030 BRCA1 and 3809 BRCA2 mutation carriers using age-dependent Cox regression, stratified by study and birth cohort. Prospective, left-truncated retrospective and full-cohort retrospective analyses were performed. Results: For BRCA1 mutation carriers, OCP use was not associated with BC risk in prospective analyses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 1.56), but in the left-truncated and full-cohort retrospective analyses, risks were increased by 26% (95% CI = 6% to 51%) and 39% (95% CI = 23% to 58%), respectively.

There was evidence of increasing risk with duration of use, especially before the first full-term pregnancy (BRCA1: both retrospective analyses,   < .001 and   = .001, respectively; BRCA2: full retrospective analysis,   = .002). Conclusion: Prospective analyses did not show that past use of OCP is associated with an increased BC risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers in young middle-aged women (40-50 years). For BRCA2 mutation carriers, a causal association is also not likely at those ages. Findings between retrospective and prospective analyses were inconsistent and could be due to survival bias or a true association for younger women who were underrepresented in the prospective cohort. Given the uncertain safety of long-term OCP use for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, indications other than contraception should be avoided and nonhormonal contraceptive methods should be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Background: Women with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations, are recommended risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) prior to menopause. Surgical menopause has significant impact on patients' health and well-being. Subsequently, concerns about surgical menopause influence uptake of RRSO in high risk women. The role of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in BRCA mutation carriers undergoing RRSO has been controversial. In the general population, premature surgical menopause is associated with worse quality of life and cognitive function, and increased risk of bone and cardiovascular disease; HRT continued until the natural age of menopause is shown to alleviate a number of these effects. Conflicting information has been published on HRT and breast cancer risk. For BRCA mutation carriers, potential augmentation of already elevated breast cancer risk is of great concern. In this article, we provide a review of the literature on HRT in this high-risk population, including effects on quality of life, cardiovascular, bone, and brain health. We also review impact of HRT on breast cancer risk, with a discussion of HRT formulation and surgical approach. Though evidence is limited, HRT after RRSO has a number of reported benefits and does not appear to impact breast cancer risk reduction in BRCA mutation carriers. This information is critical when discussing RRSO with patients, as providers should review risks of early menopause and treatment options. This review provides information to assist with counseling this specific population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption have been intensively studied in the general population to assess their effects on the risk of breast cancer, but very few studies have examined these effects in   and   mutation carriers. Given the high breast cancer risk for mutation carriers and the importance of   and   in DNA repair, better evidence on the associations of these lifestyle factors with breast cancer risk is essential. Methods: Using a large international pooled cohort of   and   mutation carriers, we conducted retrospective (5,707   mutation carriers and 3,525   mutation carriers) and prospective (2,276   mutation carriers and 1,610   mutation carriers) analyses of alcohol and tobacco consumption using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: For both   and   mutation carriers, none of the smoking-related variables was associated with breast cancer risk, except smoking for more than 5 years before a first full-term pregnancy (FFTP) when compared with parous women who never smoked. For   mutation carriers, the HR from retrospective analysis (HR ) was 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.39] and the HR from prospective analysis (HR ) was 1.36 (95% CI, 0.99-1.87). For   mutation carriers, smoking for more than 5 years before an FFTP showed an association of a similar magnitude, but the confidence limits were wider (HR  = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55 and HR  = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.83-2.01). For both carrier groups, alcohol consumption was not associated with breast cancer risk. Conclusion: The finding that smoking during the prereproductive years increases breast cancer risk for mutation carriers warrants further investigation.",

The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races. Methods: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Results: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Conclusion: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence that aromatase inhibitors are associated with small to moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer.",

Methods: Analysis of pooled observational cohort data, self-reported at enrollment and at follow-up from the International BRCA1, and BRCA2 Carrier Cohort Study, Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, and Breast Cancer Family Registry. Eligible women were BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers diagnosed with unilateral BC since 1970 and no other invasive cancer or tamoxifen use before first BC. Hazard ratios (HRs) for CBC associated with tamoxifen use were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for year and age of diagnosis, country, and bilateral oophorectomy and censoring at contralateral mastectomy, death, or loss to follow-up. Results: Of 1,583 BRCA1 and 881 BRCA2 mutation carriers, 383 (24%) and 454 (52%), respectively, took tamoxifen after first BC diagnosis. There were 520 CBCs over 20,104 person-years of observation. The adjusted HR estimates were 0.38 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.55) and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.50) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively. After left truncating at recruitment to the cohort, adjusted HR estimates were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.29 to 1.13) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.05) based on 657 BRCA1 and 426 BRCA2 mutation carriers with 100 CBCs over 4,392 person-years of prospective follow-up. HRs did not differ by estrogen receptor status of the first BC (missing for 56% of cases). Conclusion: This study provides evidence that tamoxifen use is associated with a reduction in CBC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Further follow-up of these cohorts will provide increased statistical power for future prospective analyses.",

        "abstract": "Background: About 5%-10% of breast cancer is hereditary with BRCA1 and BRCA2 being the most common genes associated with hereditary breast cancer (HBC). Several additional genes have recently been associated with HBC. These genes can be classified as highly or moderately penetrant genes with lifetime risk >30% or 17%-30%, respectively. Highly penetrant genes associated with HBC include TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, and PALB2. While, moderately penetrant genes include CHEK2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, NBN, NF1, RAD51D, and MSH6. Breast cancer risk and recommendations for screening and risk-reduction vary by gene. In general, screening breast MRI is recommended for women at >20% lifetime risk, which includes women with mutations in highly penetrant genes and the majority (but not all) moderately penetrant genes. Consideration of chemoprevention is recommended for women with mutations in high and moderately penetrant genes. Risk-reducing mastectomy does reduce the risk of breast cancer to the greatest extent and can be considered for women with highly penetrant genes. However, this procedure is associated with significant morbidities that should be considered, especially given the benefit of using screening breast MRI for high-risk women. BSO is only recommended for women with mutations in genes associate with increased risk for ovarian cancer and not as a breast cancer risk-reducing strategy. As more women undergo testing, additional genes may be identified and risk estimates for current genes and management recommendations may be modified.",

Methods: The PubMed database was searched till August 2014 and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Fixed- or random-effects models were conducted according to study heterogeneity. We calculated the pooled relative risks (RR) for cancer risk or mortality along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO) and bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) were both associated with a decreased breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (RR, 0.552; 95% CI, 0.448-0.682; RR, 0.114; 95% CI, 0.041-0.317, respectively). Similar findings were observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers separately. Moreover, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) significantly decreased contralateral breast cancer incidence in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (RR, 0.072; 95% CI, 0.035-0.148). Of note, PBSO was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers without breast cancer (HR, 0.349; 95% CI, 0.190-0.639) and those with breast cancer (HR, 0.432; 95% CI, 0.318-0.588). In addition, all-cause mortality was significantly lower for patients with CPM than those without (HR, 0.512; 95% CI, 0.368-0.714). However, BPM was not significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Data were insufficient to obtain separate estimates of survival benefit with PS in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.

Methods: In this Dutch multicenter cohort study, we used multivariable Cox models with BRRM as a time-dependent covariable to estimate the associations between BRRM and the overall and BC-specific mortality rates, separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Results: During a mean follow-up of 10.3 years, 722 out of 1712 BRCA1 (42%) and 406 out of 1145 BRCA2 (35%) mutation carriers underwent BRRM. For BRCA1 mutation carriers, we observed 52 deaths (20 from BC) in the surveillance group, and 10 deaths (one from BC) after BRRM. The hazard ratios were 0.40 (95% CI 0.20-0.90) for overall mortality and 0.06 (95% CI 0.01-0.46) for BC-specific mortality. BC-specific survival at age 65 was 93% for surveillance and 99.7% for BRRM. For BRCA2 mutation carriers, we observed 29 deaths (7 from BC) in the surveillance group, and 4 deaths (no BC) after BRRM. The hazard ratio for overall mortality was 0.45 (95% CI 0.15-1.36). BC-specific survival at age 65 was 98% for surveillance and 100% for BRRM. Conclusion: BRRM was associated with lower mortality than surveillance for BRCA1 mutation carriers, but for BRCA2 mutation carriers, BRRM may lead to similar BC-specific survival as surveillance. Our findings support a more individualized counseling based on BRCA mutation type.",

        "abstract": "Background: Preventive breast surgery is offered to unaffected BRCA mutation carriers to prevent breast cancer incidence and mortality. The clinical benefit of preventive mastectomy can be measured in several ways, including extension of life expectancy (mean years of life gained) and by estimating the probability of surviving until age 80. We sought to estimate the expected benefit of a preventive mastectomy at various ages, using these indices of mortality, by simulating hypothetical cohorts of women. Methods: The age-specific annual risks of developing breast cancer were used to estimate the actuarial risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 for women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The probability of developing breast cancer before age 80 was then modified to include competing causes of death, including from ovarian cancer. The mortality rate from breast cancer after a diagnosis of breast cancer was set at 2% annually for the first 10 years and then 1% annually for years ten to twenty. The incidence rate and mortality rate from ovarian cancer were based on published literature. We assumed that preventive mastectomy was associated with complete protection against subsequent breast cancer. A series of simulations was conducted to evaluate the reduction in the probability of death (from all causes) until age 80, according to the age at mastectomy. Results: The actuarial risk of developing breast cancer until age 80 was estimated to be 70.8%. The actual risk (incorporating competing risks) was 64.0%. The probability of being alive at age 80 by having a mastectomy at age 25 increased by 8.7% (from 42.7 to 51.3%). The estimated benefit declined with age at mastectomy; for surgery done at age 50 the improvement in survival to age 80 was much more modest (2.8% at age 80, from 42.7 to 45.5%). Conclusion: Among BRCA mutation carriers, the mortality benefit of preventive mastectomy at age 25 is substantial, but the expected benefit declines rapidly with increasing age at surgery.",

However, there may be residual breast cancer risk due to the maintained NAC. It is unclear if sparing the NAC with PM impacts on psychosocial functioning, including cancer-related distress and body image after PM. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey study of women who had undergone bilateral PM (no previous breast cancer) recruited through surgical or cancer genetics clinics. All women completed standardized questionnaires assessing cancer-related distress, anxiety, depression, satisfaction with decision, decision regret, and health-related quality of life related to breast surgery. Outcomes were compared between women with nipple-areola-sparing PM (NAC-PM) and skin-sparing PM (SS-PM). Results: Overall, 137 women completed the study; 53 (39%) had NAC-PM and 84 (61%) had SS-PM. The mean age of the study population was 41.5 years [standard deviation (SD) 8.8] and the mean time between PM and questionnaire completion was 50 months (SD 31). On the BREAST-Q, we found that women with NAC-PM had significantly higher levels of satisfaction with breasts (p = 0.01), satisfaction with outcome (p = 0.02), and sexual well-being (p < 0.001) compared with SS-PM. No statistically significant differences in total cancer-related distress (p = 0.89), anxiety (p = 0.86), or depression (p = 0.93) were observed between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, women with NAC-PM had better body image and sexual functioning compared with women with SS-PM, while both groups had comparable levels of cancer-related distress and perception of breast cancer risk.",

We assessed the rates of ipsilateral cancer events after prophylactic and therapeutic NSM in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Methods: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers undergoing NSM from October 2007 to June 2019 were identified in a single-institution prospective database, with variants of unknown significance being excluded. Patient, tumor, and outcomes data were collected. Follow-up analysis was by cumulative breast-years (total years of follow-up of each breast) and woman-years (total years of follow-up of each woman). Results: Overall, 307 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (160 BRCA1, mean age 41.4 years [range 21-65]; and 147 BRCA2, mean age 43.8 years [range 23-65]) underwent 607 NSMs, with a median follow-up of 42 months (range 1-143). 388 bilateral prophylactic NSMs had 744 cumulative woman-years of follow-up, with no new cancers seen (< 0.0013 new cancers per woman-years); 251 BRCA1 prophylactic NSMs had 1034 cumulative breast-years of follow-up, with no new ipsilateral cancers seen (< 0.0010 per breast-year); 66 BRCA1 therapeutic NSMs had 328 cumulative breast-years of follow-up, with one ipsilateral cancer recurrence not directly involving the nipple or areola (0.0030 per breast-year); 237 BRCA2 prophylactic NSMs had 926 cumulative breast-years of follow-up, with no new ipsilateral cancers seen (< 0.0011 per breast-year); and 53 BRCA2 therapeutic NSMs had 239 cumulative breast-years of follow-up, with two ipsilateral recurrent cancers, neither of which directly involved the nipple or areola (0.0084 per breast-year). Conclusion: The risk of new ipsilateral breast cancers is extremely low after NSM in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. NSM is an effective risk-reducing strategy for BRCA gene mutations.",

Patients and Methods Women whose estimated lifetime risk of OC/FTC was ≥ 10% were recruited at 42 centers in the United Kingdom and underwent ROCA screening every 4 months. TVS occurred annually if ROCA results were normal or within 2 months of an abnormal ROCA result. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) was encouraged throughout the study. Participants were observed via cancer registries, questionnaires, and notification by centers. Performance was calculated after censoring 365 days after prior screen, with modeling of occult cancers detected at RRSO. Results Between June 14, 2007, and May 15, 2012, 4,348 women underwent 13,728 women-years of screening. The median follow-up time was 4.8 years.

Seven (36.8%) of the 19 cancers diagnosed < 1 year after prior screen were stage IIIb to IV (CI, 16.3% to 61.6%) compared with 17 (94.4%) of 18 cancers diagnosed > 1 year after screening ended (CI, 72.7% to 99.9%; P < .001). Eighteen (94.8%) of 19 cancers diagnosed < 1 year after prior screen had zero residual disease (with lower surgical complexity, P = .16) (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%) compared with 13 (72.2%) of 18 cancers subsequently diagnosed (CI, 46.5% to 90.3%; P = .09). Conclusion ROCA-based screening is an option for women at high risk of OC/FTC who defer or decline RRSO, given its high sensitivity and significant stage shift. However, it remains unknown whether this strategy would improve survival in screened high-risk women.",

        "abstract": "Background: Women at familial/genetic ovarian cancer risk often undergo screening despite unproven efficacy. Research suggests each woman has her own CA125 baseline; significant increases above this level may identify cancers earlier than standard 6- to 12-monthly CA125 > 35 U/mL.  Data from prospective Cancer Genetics Network and Gynecologic Oncology Group trials, which screened 3,692 women (13,080 woman-screening years) with a strong breast/ovarian cancer family history or   mutations, were combined to assess a novel screening strategy. Specifically, serum CA125 q3 months, evaluated using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA), detected significant increases above each subject's baseline, which triggered transvaginal ultrasound. Specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were compared with levels derived from general population screening (specificity 90%, PPV 10%), and stage-at-detection was compared with historical high-risk controls.  Specificity for ultrasound referral was 92% versus 90% (  = 0.0001), and PPV was 4.6% versus 10% (  > 0.10). Eighteen of 19 malignant ovarian neoplasms [prevalent = 4, incident = 6, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) = 9] were detected via screening or RRSO. Among incident cases (which best reflect long-term screening performance), three of six invasive cancers were early-stage (I/II; 50% vs. 10% historical   controls;   = 0.016). Six of nine RRSO-related cases were stage I. ROCA flagged three of six (50%) incident cases before CA125 exceeded 35 U/mL. Eight of nine patients with stages 0/I/II ovarian cancer were alive at last follow-up (median 6 years).  For screened women at familial/genetic ovarian cancer risk, ROCA q3 months had better early-stage sensitivity at high specificity, and low yet possibly acceptable PPV compared with CA125 > 35 U/mL q6/q12 months, warranting further larger cohort evaluation.  .",

Preliminary statements were drafted based on the review of the relevant literature. During a conference call, the whole group discussed each preliminary statement and a first round of voting was carried out. Statements were removed when a consensus among group members was not obtained. The voters had the opportunity to provide comments/suggestions with their votes. The statements were then revised accordingly. Another round of voting was carried out according to the same rules to allow the whole group to evaluate the revised version of the statements.

        "abstract": "Background: Women who do not have a documented germline mutation or who do not have a strong family history suspicious for a germline mutation are considered to be at average risk of ovarian cancer. Women who have confirmed deleterious BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations are high risk of ovarian cancer. In addition, women who have a strong family history of either ovarian or breast cancer may carry a deleterious mutation and must be presumed to be at higher-than-average risk, even if they have not been tested, because there could be other mutations that are either untested or yet undiscovered that confirm higher-than-average risk of these diseases. We reviewed studies pertaining to prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women at average risk of ovarian cancer who are undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease. We also reviewed the role of prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in preventing ovarian cancer based on the level of risk of the patient. For women at average risk of ovarian cancer who are undergoing a hysterectomy for benign conditions, the decision to perform prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be individualized after appropriate informed consent, including a careful analysis of personal risk factors. Several studies suggest an overall negative health effect when prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is performed before the age of menopause. Ovarian conservation before menopause may be especially important in patients with a personal or strong family history of cardiovascular or neurological disease. Conversely, women at high risk of ovarian cancer should undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.",

The increased risk for breast cancer starts at a considerably younger age than that for tubo-ovarian cancer. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) is effective in reducing tubo-ovarian cancer risk for   and   mutation carriers, but whether it reduces breast cancer risk is less clear. All studies of rrBSO and breast cancer risk are observational in nature and subject to various forms of bias and confounding, thus limiting conclusions that can be drawn about causation. Early studies supported a statistically significant protective association for rrBSO on breast cancer risk, which is reflected by several international guidelines that recommend consideration of premenopausal rrBSO for breast cancer risk reduction. However, these historical studies were hampered by the presence of several important biases, including immortal person-time bias, confounding by indication, informative censoring, and confounding by other risk factors, which may have led to overestimation of any protective benefit. Contemporary studies, specifically designed to reduce some of these biases, have yielded contradictory results. Taken together, there is no clear and consistent evidence for a role of premenopausal rrBSO in reducing breast cancer risk in   or   mutation carriers.",

Methods: Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified from an international registry; 5,783 women completed a baseline questionnaire and ≥ one follow-up questionnaires. Women were observed until either diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, death, or date of most recent follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer incidence and all-cause mortality associated with oophorectomy were evaluated using time-dependent survival analyses. Results: After an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, 186 women developed either ovarian (n = 132), fallopian (n = 22), or peritoneal (n = 32) cancer, of whom 68 have died. HR for ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer associated with bilateral oophorectomy was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.30; P < .001). Among women who had no history of cancer at baseline, HR for all-cause mortality to age 70 years associated with an oophorectomy was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.39; P < .001).

However, when performed in pre-menopausal women, it results in premature menopause and associated detrimental health consequences. This, together with acceptance of the central role of the fallopian tube in etiopathogenesis of high-grade serous carcinoma, by far the most common type of tubo-ovarian cancer, has led to risk-reducing early salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy being proposed as a two-step surgical alternative for pre-menopausal women declining/delaying oophorectomy. Methods: To evaluate the impact on sexual function of risk-reducing early salpingectomy, within a two-step, risk-reducing, early salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy tubo-ovarian cancer prevention strategy in pre-menopausal women at increased risk of tubo-ovarian cancer. Results: Risk-reducing early salpingectomy is non-inferior for sexual and endocrine function compared with controls; risk-reducing early salpingectomy is superior for sexual/endocrine function, non-inferior for quality-of-life, and equivalent in satisfaction to the standard risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Conclusion: Multi-center, observational cohort trial with three arms: risk-reducing early salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy; risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy; controls (no surgery). Consenting individuals undergo an ultrasound, serum CA125, and follicle-stimulating hormone measurements and provide information on medical history, family history, quality-of-life, sexual function, cancer worry, psychological well-being, and satisfaction/regret. Follow-up by questionnaire takes place annually for 3 years. Women receiving risk-reducing early salpingectomy can undergo delayed oophorectomy at a later date of their choosing, or definitely by the menopause.",

Despite suggestive evidence, no data demonstrate whether bilateral salpingectomy alone lowers the risk of developing ovarian cancer in BRCA mutation carriers. We conducted a pilot study of bilateral salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (BS/DO) in BRCA mutation carriers to determine the safety and acceptability of the procedure. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter, non-randomized pilot study, pre-menopausal BRCA1/2 mutation carriers aged 30 to 47 years chose screening, RRSO, or BS/DO. For those undergoing BS/DO, the delayed oophorectomy was recommended at age 40 years for BRCA1 and age 45 years for BRCA2 patients. We compared surgical and psychosocial outcomes between time points and between arms. Results: Of the 43 patients enrolled, 19 (44%) chose BS/DO, 12 (28%) chose RRSO, and 12 (28%) chose screening. The cohort was 37% BRCA1 carriers and 63% BRCA2 carriers. One serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) was found in an RRSO patient, and no cases of occult ovarian cancers were found. There were no surgical complications. Twelve months after surgery, responses on the Cancer Worry Scale indicated decreased worry in the BS/DO (P < 0.0001) and RRSO (P = 0.01) arms, while responses on the State Anxiety Inventory indicated decreased anxiety in the BS/DO arm (P = 0.02) compared with preoperative responses. Conclusion: In this pilot study, BRCA mutation carriers who underwent bilateral salpingectomy had no intraoperative complications, were satisfied with their procedure choice, and had decreased cancer worry and anxiety after the procedure.",

Follow-up started at the date of the nationwide Dutch Pathology Registry coverage (January 1, 1989) or at the age of 25 years (whichever came last) and ended at date of EC diagnosis, last follow-up, or death (whichever came first). EC risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was compared with 1) the general population, estimating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) based on Dutch population-based incidence rates; and 2) non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, using Cox-regression analyses, expressed as hazard ratio (HR). Statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: Fifty-eight BRCA1/2 and 33 non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers developed EC over 119 296 and 160 841 person-years, respectively (SIR = 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.18 to 3.65; and HR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.53 to 3.69, respectively). gBRCA1 mutation carriers showed increased risks for EC overall (SIR = 3.51, 95% CI = 2.61 to 4.72; HR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.83 to 4.66), serous-like EC (SIR = 12.64, 95% CI = 7.62 to 20.96; HR = 10.48, 95% CI = 2.95 to 37.20), endometrioid EC (SIR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.80 to 3.83; HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.18 to 3.45), and TP53-mutated EC (HR = 15.71, 95% CI = 4.62 to 53.40).

New cancers were categorized by histologic subtype, and available tumors were analyzed for loss of the wild-type BRCA gene and/or protein expression. Conclusion: Incidence of uterine corpus cancer in BRCA+ women who underwent RRSO without hysterectomy compared with rates expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.",

        "abstract": "Background: An association between BRCA pathogenic variants and an increased endometrial cancer risk, specifically serous-like endometrial cancer, has been postulated but remains unproven, particularly for BRCA2 carriers. Mechanistic evidence is lacking, and any link may be related to tamoxifen exposure or testing bias. Hysterectomy during risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is, therefore, of uncertain benefit. Data from a large, prospective cohort will be informative. Methods: Data on UK BRCA pathogenic variant carriers were interrogated for endometrial cancer diagnoses. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated in four distinct cohorts using national endometrial cancer rates; either from 1/1/1980 or age 20, prospectively from date of personal pathogenic variant report, date of family pathogenic variant report or date of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Somatic BRCA sequencing of 15 serous endometrial cancers was performed to detect pathogenic variants. Results: Fourteen cases of endometrial cancer were identified in 2609 women (1350 BRCA1 and 1259 BRCA2), of which two were prospectively diagnosed. No significant increase in either overall or serous-like endometrial cancer risk was identified in any of the cohorts examined (SIR = 1.70, 95% confidence interval = 0.74-3.33; no cases of serous endometrial cancer diagnosed). Results were unaffected by the BRCA gene affected, previous breast cancer or tamoxifen use. No BRCA pathogenic variants were detected in any of the serous endometrial cancers tested. Conclusion: Women with a BRCA pathogenic variant do not appear to have a significant increased risk of all-type or serous-like endometrial cancer compared with the general population. These data provide some reassurance that hysterectomy is unlikely to be of significant benefit if performed solely as a preventive measure.",

For mutations in high-penetrance genes such as  / , the role of risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in cancer prevention is well-established and improves mortality. However, in moderate-penetrance genes where the degree of risk for OC is less precisely defined, the role of RRSO is more controversial. Although national guidelines have evolved to incorporate gene-specific recommendations, studies demonstrate significant variations in practice. Given this, our multidisciplinary group has reviewed the available literature on risk estimates for genes associated with OC, incorporated levels of evidence, and set thresholds for consideration of RRSO. We found that the benefit of RRSO is well-established for pathogenic variants in  /2 as well as   and  /  where the risk of OC is elevated beyond our threshold for RRSO. In  , RRSO is particularly controversial as newer studies consistently demonstrate an increased risk of OC that is dependent on family history, making uniform recommendations challenging. Additionally, new guidelines for Lynch syndrome provide gene-specific risks, questioning the role of RRSO, and even hysterectomy, for   and   mutation carriers. Given these uncertainties, shared decision making should be used around RRSO with discussion of individual risk factors, family history, and adverse effects of surgery and premature menopause.

Inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 account for about 13% of all cases and additional genes that may contribute to the missing heritability need to be investigated. In our study, a well-characterized series of 523 male BC (MBC) patients from the Italian multicenter study on MBC, enriched for non-BRCA1/2 MBC cases, was screened by a multigene custom panel of 50 cancer-associated genes. The main clinical-pathologic characteristics of MBC in pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers were also compared. BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants were detected in twenty patients, thus, a total of 503 non-BRCA1/2 MBC patients were examined in our study. Twenty-seven of the non-BRCA1/2 MBC patients were carriers of germline pathogenic variants in other genes, including two APC p.Ile1307Lys variant carriers and one MUTYH biallelic variant carrier. PALB2 was the most frequently altered gene (1.2%) and PALB2 pathogenic variants were significantly associated with high risk of MBC. Non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers were more likely to have personal (p = 0.0005) and family (p = 0.007) history of cancer. Results of our study support a central role of PALB2 in MBC susceptibility and show a low impact of CHEK2 on MBC predisposition in the Italian population. Overall, our data indicate that a multigene testing approach may benefit from appropriately selected patients with implications for clinical management and counseling of MBC patients and their family members.",

To find additional genes conferring susceptibility to breast cancer, we analyzed CHEK2 (also known as CHK2), which encodes a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase that is implicated in DNA repair processes involving BRCA1 and p53 (refs 3,4,5). We show that CHEK2(*)1100delC, a truncating variant that abrogates the kinase activity, has a frequency of 1.1% in healthy individuals. However, this variant is present in 5.1% of individuals with breast cancer from 718 families that do not carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P = 0.00000003), including 13.5% of individuals from families with male breast cancer (P = 0.00015). We estimate that the CHEK2(*)1100delC variant results in an approximately twofold increase of breast cancer risk in women and a tenfold increase of risk in men. By contrast, the variant confers no increased cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This suggests that the biological mechanisms underlying the elevated risk of breast cancer in CHEK2 mutation carriers are already subverted in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which is consistent with participation of the encoded proteins in the same pathway.",

Methods: We analyzed data from 524 families with   PVs from 21 countries. Complex segregation analysis was used to estimate relative risks (RRs; relative to country-specific population incidences) and absolute risks of cancers. The models allowed for residual familial aggregation of breast and ovarian cancer and were adjusted for the family-specific ascertainment schemes. Results: We found associations between   PVs and risk of female breast cancer (RR, 7.18; 95% CI, 5.82 to 8.85;   = 6.5 × 10 ), ovarian cancer (RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.40 to 6.04;   = 4.1 × 10 ), pancreatic cancer (RR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.50;   = 8.7 × 10 ), and male breast cancer (RR, 7.34; 95% CI, 1.28 to 42.18;   = 2.6 × 10 ). There was no evidence for increased risks of prostate or colorectal cancer. The breast cancer RRs declined with age (  for trend = 2.0 × 10 ). After adjusting for family ascertainment, breast cancer risk estimates on the basis of multiple case families were similar to the estimates from families ascertained through population-based studies (  for difference = .41). On the basis of the combined data, the estimated risks to age 80 years were 53% (95% CI, 44% to 63%) for female breast cancer, 5% (95% CI, 2% to 10%) for ovarian cancer, 2%-3% (95% CI females, 1% to 4%; 95% CI males, 2% to 5%) for pancreatic cancer, and 1% (95% CI, 0.2% to 5%) for male breast cancer. Conclusion: These results confirm   as a major breast cancer susceptibility gene and establish substantial associations between germline   PVs and ovarian, pancreatic, and male breast cancers. These findings will facilitate incorporation of   into risk prediction models and optimize the clinical cancer risk management of   PV carriers.",

Although genetic factors are involved, less is known regarding the role of anthropometric and hormonally related risk factors. Methods: In the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 11 case-control and 10 cohort investigations involving 2405 case patients (n = 1190 from case-control and n = 1215 from cohort studies) and 52013 control subjects, individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression generated study design-specific (case-control/cohort) odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with exposure estimates combined using fixed effects meta-analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Risk was statistically significantly associated with weight (highest/lowest tertile: OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.57), height (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.38), and body mass index (BMI; OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.51), with evidence that recent rather than distant BMI was the strongest predictor. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI. Diabetes also emerged as an independent risk factor (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.37).

Although age at onset of puberty and histories of infertility were unrelated to risk, never having had children was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.66). Among individuals diagnosed at older ages, a history of fractures was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.86).

We investigated these risks in 173 breast-ovarian cancer families with BRCA2 mutations identified at 20 centers in Europe and North America. Methods: Other cancer occurrence was determined in a final cohort of 3728 individuals, among whom 681 persons had breast or ovarian cancer and 3047 persons either were known mutation carriers, were first-degree relatives of known mutation carriers, or were first-degree relatives of breast or ovarian cancer patients. Incidence rates were compared with population-specific incidence rates, and relative risks (RRs) to carriers, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated by use of a maximum likelihood approach. Three hundred thirty-three other cancers occurred in this cohort. Results: Statistically significant increases in risks were observed for prostate cancer (estimated RR = 4.65; 95% CI = 3.48-6.22), pancreatic cancer (RR = 3.51; 95% CI = 1. 87-6.58), gallbladder and bile duct cancer (RR = 4.97; 95% CI = 1. 50-16.52), stomach cancer (RR = 2.59; 95%CI = 1.46-4.61), and malignant melanoma (RR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.28-5.17). The RR for prostate cancer for men below the age of 65 years was 7.33 (95% CI = 4.66-11.52).

Here, we sequenced 19 PCa predisposition genes in 1,836 Chinese patients with PCa and estimated disease risk associated with inherited mutations. Methods: Patients were recruited from 4 tertiary cancer centers (n=1,160) and a commercial laboratory (n=676). Germline DNA was sequenced using a multigene panel, and pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutation frequencies in patients with PCa were compared with populations from the gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database) and ChinaMAP (China Metabolic Analytics Project) databases. Clinical characteristics and progression-free survival were assessed by mutation status. Results: Of 1,160 patients from hospitals, 89.7% had Gleason scores ≥8, and 65.6% had metastases. P/LP mutations were identified in 8.49% of Chinese patients with PCa. Association with PCa risk was significant for mutations in ATM (odds ratio [OR], 5.9; 95% CI, 3.1-11.1), BRCA2 (OR, 15.3; 95% CI, 10.0-23.2), MSH2 (OR, 15.8; 95% CI, 4.2-59.6), and PALB2 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.7-13.2). Compared with those without mutations, patients with mutations in ATM, BRCA2, MSH2, or PALB2 showed a poor outcome with treatment using androgen deprivation therapy and abiraterone (hazard ratio, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.34-3.58] and 2.47 [95% CI, 1.23-4.96], respectively) but similar benefit from docetaxel. Conclusion: The present multicenter study confirmed that a significant proportion of Chinese patients with PCa had inherited mutations and identified predisposition genes in this underreported ethnicity. These data provide empirical evidence for precision prevention and prognostic estimation in Chinese patients with PCa.",

This study aimed to estimate   PV cancer risks independent of family cancer history. This analysis included patients referred for hereditary cancer testing with a multi-gene panel (  = 627,742). Cancer risks for   PV carriers (  = 4,607) were adjusted for family history using multivariable logistic regression and reported as ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subanalyses of the c.7271T>G missense PV were conducted. Moderate-to-high risks for pancreatic (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 3.24-5.47), prostate (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.93-3.44), gastric (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.66-5.31), and invasive ductal breast (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.89-2.19) cancers were estimated for   PV carriers. Notably, c.7271T>G was associated with higher invasive ductal breast cancer risk (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.76-5.12) than other missense and truncating   PVs. Low-to-moderate risks were seen for ductal carcinoma   (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.61-2.02), male breast cancer (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.75), ovarian cancer (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.35-1.83), colorectal cancer (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.24-1.79), and melanoma (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81).   PVs are associated with multiple cancer risks and, while professional society guidelines support that carriers are eligible for increased breast and pancreatic cancer screening, increased screening for prostate and gastric cancer may also be warranted. c.7271T>G is associated with high risk for breast cancer, with a 3- to 4-fold risk increase that supports consideration of strategies for prevention and/or early detection. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: This study estimated risks for multiple cancers associated with   pathogenic variants independent of family history. These results indicate that some common variants may be associated with higher breast cancer risks than previously appreciated and increased screening for prostate and gastric cancer may be warranted for carriers of   pathogenic variants.",

        "abstract": "Background: While gene panel sequencing is becoming widely used for cancer risk prediction, its clinical utility with respect to predicting aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa) is limited by our current understanding of the genetic risk factors associated with predisposition to this potentially lethal disease phenotype. This study included 837 men diagnosed with aggressive PrCa and 7261 controls (unaffected men and men who did not meet criteria for aggressive PrCa). Rare germline pathogenic variants (including likely pathogenic variants) were identified by targeted sequencing of 26 known or putative cancer predisposition genes. We found that 85 (10%) men with aggressive PrCa and 265 (4%) controls carried a pathogenic variant (  < 0.0001). Aggressive PrCa odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Increased risk of aggressive PrCa (OR (95% confidence interval)) was identified for pathogenic variants in   (5.8 (2.7-12.4)),   (5.5 (1.8-16.6)), and   (3.8 (1.6-9.1)). Our study provides further evidence that rare germline pathogenic variants in these genes are associated with increased risk of this aggressive, clinically relevant subset of PrCa. These rare genetic variants could be incorporated into risk prediction models to improve their precision to identify men at highest risk of aggressive prostate cancer and be used to identify men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who require urgent treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: PALB2 germline pathogenic variants are associated with increased breast cancer risk and smaller increased risk of pancreatic and likely ovarian cancer. Resources for health-care professionals managing PALB2 heterozygotes are currently limited. Methods: A workgroup of experts sought to outline management of PALB2 heterozygotes based on current evidence. Peer-reviewed publications from PubMed were identified to guide recommendations, which arose by consensus and the collective expertise of the authors. Results: PALB2 heterozygotes should be offered BRCA1/2-equivalent breast surveillance. Risk-reducing mastectomy can be considered guided by personalized risk estimates. Pancreatic cancer surveillance should be considered, but ideally as part of a clinical trial. Typically, ovarian cancer surveillance is not recommended, and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy should only rarely be considered before the age of 50. Given the mechanistic similarities, PALB2 heterozygotes should be considered for therapeutic regimens and trials as those for BRCA1/2. Conclusion: This guidance is similar to those for BRCA1/2. While the range of the cancer risk estimates overlap with BRCA1/2, point estimates are lower in PALB2 so individualized estimates are important for management decisions. Systematic prospective data collection is needed to determine as yet unanswered questions such as the risk of contralateral breast cancer and survival after cancer diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: The International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening Consortium met in 2018 to update its consensus recommendations for the management of individuals with increased risk of pancreatic cancer based on family history or germline mutation status (high-risk individuals). Methods: A modified Delphi approach was employed to reach consensus among a multidisciplinary group of experts who voted on consensus statements. Consensus was considered reached if ≥75% agreed or disagreed. Results: Consensus was reached on 55 statements. The main goals of surveillance (to identify high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions and T1N0M0 pancreatic cancer) remained unchanged. Experts agreed that for those with familial risk, surveillance should start no earlier than age 50 or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer, but were split on whether to start at age 50 or 55. Germline   mutation carriers with one affected first-degree relative are now considered eligible for surveillance. Experts agreed that preferred surveillance tests are endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but no consensus was reached on how to alternate these modalities. Annual surveillance is recommended in the absence of concerning lesions. Main areas of disagreement included if and how surveillance should be performed for hereditary pancreatitis, and the management of indeterminate lesions. Conclusion: Pancreatic surveillance is recommended for selected high-risk individuals to detect early pancreatic cancer and its high-grade precursors, but should be performed in a research setting by multidisciplinary teams in centres with appropriate expertise. Until more evidence supporting these recommendations is available, the benefits, risks and costs of surveillance of pancreatic surveillance need additional evaluation.",

Late-stage PDACs refer to T  N M  and nodal or distant metastatic PDAC stages diagnosed during the follow-up phase of HRI surveillance. This study aimed to quantify late-stage PDACs during HRI surveillance and identify associated clinicoradiologic factors. Methods: A systematic search (PROSPERO:CRD42018117189) from Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was last performed on April 18, 2021. Only original HRI surveillance manuscripts that specified follow-up strategies were included, and studies with only baseline information were excluded. Cumulative incidences of advanced neoplasia: high-grade precursors and all PDACs, and surveillance-detected/interval late-stage PDACs were calculated through random-effects model. Incidence of late-stage PDACs underwent metaregression to identify association with HRI clinicoradiologic features. Publication bias was assessed through the funnel plot and Egger's regression line. Results: Thirteen original surveillance studies included 2169 HRIs followed over 7302.72 patient-years. Cumulative incidence of advanced neoplasia and late-stage PDACs was 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6-7.4) and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.2-4.0) per 1000 patient-years, respectively. Late-stage PDACs lacked significant association with surveillance imaging, baseline pancreatic morphology, study location, genetic background, gender, or age. Limited information on diagnostic error, symptoms, timing of presentation, lesion site, and surveillance adherence precluded formal meta-analysis. Conclusion: A sizeable proportion of late-stage PDACs were detected during follow-up. Their incidence lacked association with baseline clinicoradiologic features. Further causal investigation of stage-based outcomes is warranted for overall improvement in HRI surveillance.",

We aimed to investigate the progression to neoplasia from serial prediagnostic pancreatic imaging tests in high-risk individuals and identify factors associated with successful early detection. Methods: We retrospectively examined the development of pancreatic abnormalities in high-risk individuals who were diagnosed with PC or underwent pancreatic surgery, or both, in 16 international surveillance programs. Results: Of 2552 high-risk individuals under surveillance, 28 (1%) developed neoplastic progression to PC or high-grade dysplasia during a median follow-up of 29 months after baseline (interquartile range [IQR], 40 months). Of these, 13 of 28 (46%) presented with a new lesion (median size, 15 mm; range 7-57 mm), a median of 11 months (IQR, 8; range 3-17 months) after a prior examination, by which time 10 of 13 (77%) had progressed beyond the pancreas. The remaining 15 of 28 (54%) had neoplastic progression in a previously detected lesion (12 originally cystic, 2 indeterminate, 1 solid), and 11 (73%) had PC progressed beyond the pancreas. The 12 patients with cysts had been monitored for 21 months (IQR, 15 months) and had a median growth of 5 mm/y (IQR, 8 mm/y). Successful early detection (as high-grade dysplasia or PC confined to the pancreas) was associated with resection of cystic lesions (vs solid or indeterminate lesions (odds ratio, 5.388; 95% confidence interval, 1.525-19.029) and small lesions (odds ratio, 0.890/mm; 95% confidence interval 0.812-0.976/mm). Conclusion: In nearly half of high-risk individuals developing high-grade dysplasia or PC, no prior lesions are detected by imaging, yet they present at an advanced stage. Progression can occur before the next scheduled annual examination. More sensitive diagnostic tools or a different management strategy for rapidly growing cysts are needed.",

Methods: Individuals recommended for pancreas surveillance were prospectively enrolled into one of eight CAPS5 study centers between 2014 and 2021. The primary end point was the stage distribution of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) detected (stage I   higher-stage). Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 1,461 high-risk individuals enrolled into CAPS5, 48.5% had a pathogenic variant in a PDAC-susceptibility gene. Ten patients were diagnosed with PDAC, one of whom was diagnosed with metastatic PDAC 4 years after dropping out of surveillance. Of the remaining nine, seven (77.8%) had a stage I PDAC (by surgical pathology) detected during surveillance; one had stage II, and one had stage III disease. Seven of these nine patients with PDAC were alive after a median follow-up of 2.6 years. Eight additional patients underwent surgical resection for worrisome lesions; three had high-grade and five had low-grade dysplasia in their resected specimens. In the entire CAPS cohort (CAPS1-5 studies, 1,731 patients), 26 PDAC cases have been diagnosed, 19 within surveillance, 57.9% of whom had stage I and 5.2% had stage IV disease. By contrast, six of the seven PDACs (85.7%) detected outside surveillance were stage IV. Five-year survival to date of the patients with a screen-detected PDAC is 73.3%, and median overall survival is 9.8 years, compared with 1.5 years for patients diagnosed with PDAC outside surveillance (hazard ratio [95% CI]; 0.13 [0.03 to 0.50],   = .003).

Development of cancer multi-gene panels has resulted in an exponential increase of germline   testing in breast cancer patients.

In breast cancer patients harbouring germline disease-causing   variants, radiotherapy contributing to the development of subsequent tumours should be, if possible, avoided and, within families, annual follow-up including whole-body MRI should be offered to carriers.

It is largely caused by inactivating germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDH1, although pathogenic variants in CTNNA1 occur in a minority of families with HDGC. In this Policy Review, we present updated clinical practice guidelines for HDGC from the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC), which recognise the emerging evidence of variability in gastric cancer risk between families with HDGC, the growing capability of endoscopic and histological surveillance in HDGC, and increased experience of managing long-term sequelae of total gastrectomy in young patients. To redress the balance between the accessibility, cost, and acceptance of genetic testing and the increased identification of pathogenic variant carriers, the HDGC genetic testing criteria have been relaxed, mainly through less restrictive age limits. Prophylactic total gastrectomy remains the recommended option for gastric cancer risk management in pathogenic CDH1 variant carriers. However, there is increasing confidence from the IGCLC that endoscopic surveillance in expert centres can be safely offered to patients who wish to postpone surgery, or to those whose risk of developing gastric cancer is not well defined.",

We extend the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) risk model to incorporate the effects of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and other risk factors (RFs). Methods: BOADICEA incorporates the effects of truncating variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, and ATM; a PRS based on 313 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explaining 20% of BC polygenic variance; a residual polygenic component accounting for other genetic/familial effects; known lifestyle/hormonal/reproductive RFs; and mammographic density, while allowing for missing information. Results: Among all factors considered, the predicted UK BC risk distribution is widest for the PRS, followed by mammographic density. The highest BC risk stratification is achieved when all genetic and lifestyle/hormonal/reproductive/anthropomorphic factors are considered jointly. With all factors, the predicted lifetime risks for women in the UK population vary from 2.8% for the 1st percentile to 30.6% for the 99th percentile, with 14.7% of women predicted to have a lifetime risk of ≥17-<30% (moderate risk according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guidelines) and 1.1% a lifetime risk of ≥30% (high risk). Conclusion: This comprehensive model should enable high levels of BC risk stratification in the general population and women with family history, and facilitate individualized, informed decision-making on prevention therapies and screening.",

It seems plausible that this mutation could also predispose to other cancers. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CHEK2*1100delC heterozygosity is associated with increased risk for other cancers in addition to breast cancer in the general population. Methods: We examined 86,975 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study, recruited from 2003 through 2010. The participants completed a questionnaire on health and lifestyle, were examined physically, had blood drawn for DNA extraction, were tested for presence of CHEK2*1100delC using Taqman assays and sequencing, and were linked over 1943 through 2011 to the Danish Cancer Registry. Incidences and risks of individual cancer types, including breast cancer, were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, Fine and Gray competing-risks regressions, and stratified analyses with interaction tests. Results: Among 86,975 individuals, 670 (0.8%) were CHEK2*1100delC heterozygous, 2,442 developed breast cancer, and 6,635 developed other cancers. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for CHEK2*1100delC heterozygotes compared with noncarriers was 2.08 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.85) for breast cancer and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.82) for other cancers. When stratifying for sex, the age-adjusted hazard ratios for other cancers were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.18) for women and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.85) for men (sex difference: P = .63). For CHEK2*1100delC heterozygotes compared with noncarriers, the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios were 5.76 (95% CI, 2.12 to 15.6) for stomach cancer, 3.61 (95% CI, 1.33 to 9.79) for kidney cancer, 3.45 (95% CI, 1.09 to 10.9) for sarcoma, and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.00 to 2.56) for prostate cancer. Conclusion: CHEK2*1100delC heterozygosity is associated with 15% to 82% increased risk for at least some cancers in addition to breast cancer.

Methods: On December 5th-7th, 2019, patient advocates and physicians with expertise in the field of reproductive medicine, fertility preservation, and oncology were invited to \"San Giuseppe Moscati\" Hospital in Avellino (Italy) for a workshop on reproductive management of women with germline pathogenic variants in the BRCA1/2 genes. From the discussion regarding the current evidence and future prospective in the field, eight main research questions were formulated and eight recommendations were developed regarding fertility, fertility preservation, preimplantation genetic testing, and pregnancy in healthy carriers and patients with cancer. Results: Several misconceptions about the topic persist among health care providers and patients often resulting in a discontinuous and suboptimal management. With the aim to offer patient-tailored counseling about reproductive issues, both awareness of current evidences and research should be promoted.",

        "abstract": "Background: BRCA mutation carriers have an increased risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) is associated with a decrease in risk for tubal and ovarian cancer. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer risk in the general population. This review analyses the published data on HRT and risk of cancer in BRCA mutation carriers with and without RRBSO. Methods: We included all relevant articles published in English from 1995 to October 2020. Sources were identified through a search on PubMed and Cochrane Library. Results: We included one case-control and one retrospective cohort study on ovarian and one case-control study on endometrial cancer risk and HRT in BRCA mutation carriers. Regarding breast cancer risk, one case-control study on BRCA mutation carriers with and without RRBSO and one case-control study, one Markov chain decision model, two prospective cohort studies, and one metaanalysis on carriers after RRBSO were included. For ovarian cancer, results were ambiguous. For breast cancer, most studies did not find an adverse effect associated with HRT. However, some of the studies found a risk modification associated with different formulations and duration of use. Conclusion: Although data are limited, HRT does not seem to have a relevant effect on cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers. RRBSO should not be postponed to avoid subsequent HRT in this population. Adequate HRT after RRBSO should be offered to avoid chronic diseases resulting from low estrogen levels. However, further data on the safety of different formulations are needed.",

        "abstract": "Background: BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers often undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) before natural menopause, raising the issue of hormonal replacement treatment (HRT) use. There is conflicting evidence on the effect of HRT on breast cancer (BC) risk, and there are limited data on risk based on age at exposure. In the general population, HRT users have an increased BC risk (hazard ratio = 1.34). We assessed the impact of short-term HRT use on BC risk among healthy BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, with emphasis on age at exposure to HRT. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 306 consecutive healthy BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who had undergone RRSO was followed up for a mean of 7.26 years. We compared BC incidence over time in carriers who received HRT with that in those who did not receive. Results: Thirty-six of the carriers were diagnosed with BC, 20 of 148 patients (13.5%) in the HRT group compared with 16 of 155 (10.3%) in the non-HRT group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7-2.7). In women who were aged 45 years or younger at RRSO, HRT did not affect BC rates. However, in those older than 45 years at RRSO, BC rates were significantly higher in HRT users than in non-users (OR = 3.43, p < 0.05, 95% CI = 1.2-9.8). Conclusion: In BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers in this study, short-term post-RRSO HRT use was associated with a threefold risk of BC in carriers older than 45 years. These results suggest that risk may be related to time of exposure to HRT around the natural age of menopause, even among BRCA1/2 carriers. Further studies are needed for validation and to guide future recommendations.",

The different instruments used for the measurement of each construct were reported. In addition, risk and protective factors associated with psychological outcomes of genetic tests were explored. Methods: Bibliographic databases were searched for studies published over the period 1998-2018. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, 21 articles were selected for the current review. Results: Overall, the collected data revealed rather diverse results, although most studies reported higher levels of distress, anxiety and depression in carriers, as compared to non-carriers. The two genders were not equally represented, with men constituting only 6% of the sample. Risk factors and protective factors that may influence psychological outcomes and adjustment to genetic tests are highlighted and discussed in this review. Conclusion: The increased risk of developing cancer associated with positive genetic testing results may be experienced as traumatic by many patients, although not all individuals with positive genetic testing results will experience increased distress. Hence, future studies should consider specific risk factors in order to select those who are more likely to be in need of psychological support. Finally, it is necessary to increase the number of male samples to better understand the male experience related to genetic testing outcomes.",

They often report that they are left alone with these important decisions. In order to enhance the genetic counselling session we organized a group-based patient education (GPE) course for women with  -mutations. The study aims were to characterize women attending a group-based patient education (GPE) course for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, consider the usefulness of the course, evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression among the participants, and finally investigate whether their levels of anxiety and depression changed from before to after the course session. Methods: A prospective study was conducted. Two weeks before (T1) and 2 weeks after (T2) attending the GPE-course the participants received questionnaires by mail. We collected information on demographic- and medical variables, anxiety and depression using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), self-efficacy using The Bergen Genetic Counseling Self-Efficacy scale (BGCSES) and coping style using the Threatening Medical Situations Inventory (TMSI). A total of   = 100 (77% response rate) women participated at baseline and 75 (58% response rate) also completed post-course assessment. Results: The mean level of anxiety symptoms was elevated among participants but decreased significantly during follow-up. Lower anxiety symptom levels were associated with \"longer time since disclosure of gene test result\", \"higher levels of self-efficacy\" and having experienced \"loss of a close relative due to breast or ovarian cancer\". Lower depression symptom levels were associated with \"higher levels of education\" and \"loss of a close relative due to breast or ovarian cancer\". Conclusion: The women in this study seemed to benefit from the GPE course. Women newly diagnosed with a   mutation who reported lower levels of self-efficacy and lower levels of education were more vulnerable. These women need special attention.",

Three hundred and eighteen individuals (160 affected, 158 unaffected) completed several distress and psychosocial needs questionnaires (including the Brief Symptom Inventory-18). Sixty key informants were also surveyed about their perspective on the support needs of this population. In the largely female (90%), largely HBOC syndrome group (approximately 90%), 20% had significant levels of generalized distress, with no significant differences between affected and unaffected individuals. Generalized distress was also not significantly different as a function of mutation status. Individuals who received inconclusive test results, however, were more likely to indicate somatic symptoms of distress. Those individuals who did not have social support were more likely to be those who had never had cancer and who either had a mutation, received inconclusive test results, or were not tested. Key informants were most likely to indicate that patients need more support. These results provide evidence for the importance of establishing regular psychosocial distress screening, including a focus on somatic symptoms, in such high risk populations.",

How the result of genetic testing affects the psychological well-being of the individuals is an under-researched area in many populations. Follow-up analysis of psychological well-being via HADS scale was performed in 364 individuals at 3 months and 1 year after the disclosure of BRCA1/2 genetic result. We analyzed potential predictors for pathological anxiety and variables associated to the variation of HADS scores over time. At pre-test only 16% and 4% of individuals presented symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Having a prior diagnosis of cancer and presenting a pathological HADS-A score at the baseline were associated with clinically significant anxiety scores at one year, but the genetic test result was not. Thus, BRCA genetic testing does not influence short and long term anxiety and depression levels among those identified as mutation carriers. It is our task to demystify the allegedly negative impact of BRCA testing on psychological well being to increase the uptake of genetic testing and benefit those who are at high risk of developing breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.",

We performed a systematic review of intermediate- and long-term studies investigating the psychological impact like psychological distress, anxiety, and depression in cancer-affected BRCA mutation carriers compared to unaffected mutation carriers. This review included the screening of 1243 studies. Eight intermediate- and long-term studies focusing on distress, anxiety, and depression symptoms among cancer-affected mutation carriers at least six months after the disclosure of genetic testing results were included. Studies reported a great variety of designs, methods, and patient outcomes. We found evidence indicating that cancer-affected mutation carriers experienced a negative effect in relation to psychological well-being in terms of an increase in symptoms of distress, anxiety, and depression in the first months after test disclosure. In the intermediate- and long-term, no significant clinical relevant symptoms occurred. However, none of the included studies used specific measurements, which can clearly identify psychological burdens of cancer-affected mutation carriers. We concluded that current well-implemented distress screening instruments are not sufficient for precisely identifying the psychological burden of genetic testing. Therefore, future studies should implement coping strategies, specific personality structures, the impact of genetic testing, supportive care needs and disease management behaviour to clearly screen for the possible intermediate- and long-term psychological impact of a positive test disclosure.",

Individuals' psychological reactions are influenced by both the content of the received information and the subjective perception of their own risk of becoming ill or being a carrier of a genetic mutation. This study included 120 participants who underwent genetic counselling for breast and/or ovarian cancer. The aim of the study was to examine the relation between their cancer risk perception and the genetic risk during CGO before receiving genetic test results, considering the influence of some psychological variables, in particular distress, anxiety and depression. Participants completed the following tools during a psychological interview: a socio-demographic form, Cancer Risk Perception (CRP) and Genetic Risk Perception (GRP), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Distress Thermometer (DT). The data seem to confirm our hypothesis. Positive and significant correlations were found between the observed variables. Moreover, genetic risk perception determined an increase in depressive symptomatology and cancer risk perception led to an increase in anxious symptomatology, specifically in participants during cancer treatment. The present results suggest the importance of assessing genetic and cancer risk perception in individuals who undergo CGO, to identify those who are at risk of a decrease in psychological well-being and of developing greater psychological distress.",

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to describe and compare uptake of and psychosocial outcomes following BRCA1/2 testing in a sample of men and women at high-risk for carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation. Men (n = 98) and women (n = 243) unaffected with cancer completed baseline assessments prior to genetic counseling and testing and then 6- and 12-months post-testing. Most men (n = 94; 95.9%) opted to have genetic testing, of whom 44 received positive BRCA1/2 genetic test results and 50 received true negative results. Among women, 93.4% had genetic testing, of whom 79 received positive results and 148 received negative results. In multivariate models, male BRCA1/2 carriers reported significantly higher genetic testing distress (6-months: Z = 4.48, P < 0.0001; 12-months: Z = 2.78, P < 0.01) than male non-carriers. After controlling for baseline levels of distress, no statistically significant differences emerged between male and female BRCA1/2 carriers in psychological distress at 12-months post-testing, although absolute differences were evident over time. Predictors of distress related to genetic testing among male carriers at 12-months included higher baseline cancer-specific distress (Z = 4.73, P < 0.0001) and being unmarried (Z = 2.18, P < 0.05). Similarly, baseline cancer-specific distress was independently associated with cancer-specific distress at 6- (Z = 3.66, P < 0.001) and 12-months (Z = 4.44, P < 0.0001) post-testing among male carriers. Clinically, our results suggest that pre-test assessment of distress and creation of educational materials specifically tailored to the needs and concerns of male carriers may be appropriate in this important but understudied high-risk group.",

This reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 96%, but can result in undesirable side effects, including menopausal symptoms and sexual dysfunction. We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of RRBSO on sexual function in women at high risk of breast/and or ovarian cancer. Methods: A literature search of the AMED (Allied and complementary medicine), Embase and Medline databases was performed, using search terms including sexual function, risk reducing and oophorectomy. Results were filtered according to the PRISMA protocol. Quality assessment of studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Data were pooled in meta-analysis. Results: There were 21 eligible studies, 10 of which reported sufficient data for meta-analysis. Most studies were retrospective cohort or observational studies. Fifteen of the 21 studies (71%) reported a negative impact of RRBSO on sexual function. Participant numbers ranged from 37 to 1522. Meta-analysis was performed with studies including 3201 patients. This demonstrated that RRBSO has a statistically significant negative impact on sexual function (SMD -0.63, [-0.82, -0.44], p = 0.03). There was a trend towards reduced sexual pleasure and increased discomfort but this did not reach statistical significance. There was minimal change in the frequency of sex. There was a significant increase in vaginal dryness post-RRBSO (SMD 9.25, [3.66, 14.83], p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in sexual function between pre-menopausal and post-menopausal RRBSO. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) did not abolish this negative impact. Conclusion: Sexual function declines post RRBSO, independent of menopausal status. Comprehensive pre-operative counselling regarding anticipated menopausal and sexual symptoms is key to setting realistic patient expectations and minimising post-operative distress. Information and support regarding management of these side effects should be available to all patients.",

An increasing number of women, including young women, are taking up this option. However, there is a dearth of information for younger women (under 40 years) choosing preventative mastectomy. In fact, no studies to date have specifically focused on younger women's experiences of a BPM and investigated their informational needs. The purpose of this review is to report on the current literature surrounding the psychological experience of a BPM and the informational needs for women at high risk of developing BC with a particular emphasis on younger women. Research has highlighted a range of psychological outcomes linked to preventative mastectomy, including positives such as reduced anxiety and negatives including impaired body image and sexuality. The literature strongly suggests women want more information surrounding BPM, particularly related to the after effects of the surgery, and the impact on their psychological wellbeing. Research method limitations and reporting has resulted in conflicting conclusions, making it difficult for women to be well informed. In particular, there has been little focus on the experiences and needs of younger women opting for BPM. Due to the unique needs of younger women and an increase in BPM rates for younger women, it is imperative that the needs of this group are addressed. Together these findings provide justification and recommendation for further research in this area.",

Evaluating patient-reported outcomes following BPM are thus essential for evaluating success of BPM from patient's perspective. Our systematic review aimed to: (1) identify studies describing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients following BPM with or without reconstruction; (2) assess the effect of BPM with or without reconstruction on HRQOL; and (3) identify predictors of HRQOL post-BPM. Methods: We performed a systematic review of literature using the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched. Results: The initial search resulted in 1082 studies; 22 of these studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Post-BPM, patients are satisfied with the outcomes and report high psychosocial well-being and positive body image. Sexual well-being and somatosensory function are most negatively affected. Vulnerability, psychological distress and preoperative cancer distress are significant negative predictors of quality of life and body image post-BPM. Conclusion: There is a paucity of high-quality data on outcomes of different HRQOL domains post-BPM. Future studies should strive to use validated and breast-specific PRO instruments for measuring HRQOL. This will facilitate shared decision-making by enabling surgeons to provide evidence-based answers to women contemplating BPM.",

The majority of women were satisfied with their decision. However, the majority of studies indicate that up to one-half of the women suffer a negative effect on body image and changes in sexuality. Knowledge of these findings can improve the practitioner's ability to counsel women regarding this radical decision. Further research, particularly prospective studies, are needed to examine women's body image prior to BPM so that the impact of prophylactic mastectomy can be examined more thoroughly.",

        "abstract": "Background: We assessed the associations between population-based polygenic risk scores (PRS) for breast (BC) or epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) with cancer risks for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers. Methods: Retrospective cohort data on 18,935 BRCA1 and 12,339 BRCA2 female pathogenic variant carriers of European ancestry were available. Three versions of a 313 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) BC PRS were evaluated based on whether they predict overall, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, or ER-positive BC, and two PRS for overall or high-grade serous EOC. Associations were validated in a prospective cohort. Results: The ER-negative PRS showed the strongest association with BC risk for BRCA1 carriers (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation = 1.29 [95% CI 1.25-1.33], P = 3×10 ). For BRCA2, the strongest association was with overall BC PRS (HR = 1.31 [95% CI 1.27-1.36], P = 7×10 ). HR estimates decreased significantly with age and there was evidence for differences in associations by predicted variant effects on protein expression. The HR estimates were smaller than general population estimates. The high-grade serous PRS yielded the strongest associations with EOC risk for BRCA1 (HR = 1.32 [95% CI 1.25-1.40], P = 3×10 ) and BRCA2 (HR = 1.44 [95% CI 1.30-1.60], P = 4×10 ) carriers. The associations in the prospective cohort were similar. Conclusion: Population-based PRS are strongly associated with BC and EOC risks for BRCA1/2 carriers and predict substantial absolute risk differences for women at PRS distribution extremes.",

        "abstract": "Background: Female carriers of a   or   germline mutation face a high lifetime risk to develop breast and ovarian cancer. Risk-reducing surgery, such as prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, are proven strategies to prevent breast and ovarian cancer. These procedures are, however, associated with considerable side effects, and the uptake of these highly effective interventions is therefore low in many countries. This highlights the need for alternative and noninvasive strategies for risk reduction in mutation carriers. Methods: While endocrine treatments with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention, their benefit in primary prevention has never been prospectively evaluated. Moreover, their side effect profile makes them inappropriate candidates for chemoprevention in healthy premenopausal women. Recently, denosumab, a well-tolerated osteoprotective drug, has been shown to have an antitumoral effect on RANK+,  -deficient luminal progenitor cells in vitro, and has been demonstrated to abrogate tumors in  -deficient mouse models. Results: The prospectively randomized, double-blind BRCA-P trial is currently investigating the preventative effect of denosumab in healthy   germline mutation carriers.",

Methods: Between February 2018 and February 2020, patients with localized breast cancer (pT0-3 pN0-1 M0) were offered participation in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial assessing adjuvant moderate hypofractionation (MHF) to 40 Gy in 15 fractions versus ultrahypofractionation (UHF) to 25 Gy in 5 fractions after BCS, with an optional simultaneously integrated boost. Toxicities, cosmesis, and quality of life were assessed at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years from irradiation using validated metric tools. Results: One hundred seven patients were randomized to MHF (n = 54) or UHF (n = 53) adjuvant WBI. The median follow-up was 42.8 months. Grade 2 radiation dermatitis was experienced by 4 patients (7.4%) in the MHF arm and 2 patients (3.7%) in the UHF arm at EOT (P = .726). No grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed. Deterioration of cosmesis by physician assessment was observed in 2 (6.7%) patients treated in the UHF arm and 1 (1.9%) patient treated in the MHF arm at EOT (P = .534), whereas at 3 months, only 1 (1.8%) patient treated in the MHF arm demonstrated deterioration of cosmesis (P = .315). At EOT, 91% and 94% of patients reported excellent/good cosmesis among those treated with MHF and UHF regimens, respectively (P = .550). At 3 months, more patients within the MHF arm reported excellent/good cosmesis compared with those in the UHF arm (100% vs 91%; P = .030). However, the difference in patient-reported cosmesis disappeared at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year time points. Conclusion: UHF WBI showed similar treatment-related late toxicities and similar provider-scored cosmesis compared with MHF radiation in patients treated adjuvantly after BCS.",

        "abstract": "Background: The widespread use of vaccines against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become one of the most effective means to establish a population immune barrier. Patients with cancer are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, adverse events, and high mortality, and should be the focus of epidemic prevention and treatment. However, real-world data on the safety of vaccines for patients with breast cancer are still scarce. Methods: This study aims to compare the safety of COVID-19 vaccines between patients vaccinated before or after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Results: Patients with breast cancer who sought medical advice from October 2021 to December 2021 were screened. Those who received COVID-19 vaccines were enrolled in this study to analyze the safety of the vaccines. The primary outcome was patient-reported adverse events (AEs). All events after vaccine injection were retrospectively documented from the patients. Conclusion: A total of 15,455 patients with breast cancer from 41 hospitals in 20 provinces in China were screened, and 5766 patients who received COVID-19 vaccines were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 45.1% (n=2599) of patients received vaccines before breast cancer diagnosis, 41.3% (n=2379) were vaccinated after diagnosis, and 13.6% (n=784) did not known the accurate date of vaccination or cancer diagnosis. Among the patients vaccinated after diagnosis, 85.4% (n=2032) were vaccinated 1 year after cancer diagnosis and 95.4% (n=2270) were vaccinated during early-stage cancer. Of all 5766 vaccinated patients, 93.9% (n=5415) received an inactivated vaccine, 3.7% (n=213) received a recombinant subunit vaccine, and 2.4% (n=138) received other vaccines, including adenovirus and mRNA vaccines. In the first injection of vaccines, 24.4% (n=10, 95% CI 11.2-37.5) of patients who received an adenovirus vaccine reported AEs, compared to only 12.5% (n=677, 95% CI 11.6-13.4) of those who received an inactivated vaccine. Patients with metastatic breast cancer reported the highest incidence of AEs (n=18, 16.5%, 95% CI 9.5-23.5). Following the second injection, patients who received an inactivated vaccine (n=464, 8.7%, 95% CI 8.0-9.5) and those who received a recombinant vaccine (n=25, 8.7%, 95% CI 5.5-12.0) reported the same incidence of AEs. No significant differences in patient-reported AEs were found between the healthy population and patients with breast cancer (16.4% vs 16.9%, respectively); the most common AEs were local pain (11.1% vs 9.1%, respectively), fatigue (5.5% vs 6.3%, respectively), and muscle soreness (2.3% vs 3.6%, respectively). The type of vaccine and time window of vaccination had little impact on patient-reported AEs.",

Here, we present long-term results from the Danish Breast Cancer Group Internal Mammary Node study cohort. Methods: This nationwide, prospective cohort study allocated patients with node-positive early breast cancer to adjuvant radiotherapy with or without IMNI depending on cancer laterality. Patients with right-sided cancer received IMNI. Patients with left-sided cancer were treated without IMNI because of risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Other treatment was independent of laterality. The primary study end point was OS. Secondary end points were distant recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Analyses were by intention to treat. Results: During 2003-2007, 3,089 women were allocated to IMNI (right-sided, n = 1,491) or no IMNI (left-sided, n = 1,598). With a median follow-up of 14.8 years, 589 patients with and 701 patients without IMNI had died. The corresponding 15-year OS rates were 60.1% and 55.4%. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.96;   = .007) in favor of IMNI. The 15-year risk of developing distant recurrence was 35.6% (523 recurrences) and 38.6% (602 recurrences) with vs. without IMNI (adjusted HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99;   = .04]). The 15-year breast cancer mortality with IMNI was 31.7% (467 deaths) compared with 33.9% (537 deaths) without IMNI (adjusted HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.00;   = .05]). The distribution of other deaths was similar across groups. Conclusion: In patients with node-positive early breast cancer treated with IMNI or without IMNI depending on breast cancer laterality, IMNI reduced the risk of distant recurrence and death from breast cancer, thereby improving long-term survival.",

        "abstract": "Background: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer has recently emerged as a targetable subset of breast tumors, based on the evidence from clinical trials of novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. This evolution has raised several biological and clinical questions, warranting the establishment of consensus to optimally treat patients with HER2-low breast tumors. Between 2022 and 2023, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) held a virtual consensus-building process focused on HER2-low breast cancer. The consensus included a multidisciplinary panel of 32 leading experts in the management of breast cancer from nine different countries. The aim of the consensus was to develop statements on topics that are not covered in detail in the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline. The main topics identified for discussion were (i) biology of HER2-low breast cancer; (ii) pathologic diagnosis of HER2-low breast cancer; (iii) clinical management of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer; and (iv) clinical trial design for HER2-low breast cancer. The expert panel was divided into four working groups to address questions relating to one of the four topics outlined above. A review of the relevant scientific literature was conducted in advance. Consensus statements were developed by the working groups and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This article presents the developed statements, including findings from the expert panel discussions, expert opinion, and a summary of evidence supporting each statement.",

Methods: A multidisciplinary international Expert Panel was convened to update the clinical practice guideline recommendations informed by a systematic review of the medical literature. Results: The Expert Panel continues to recommend ER testing of invasive breast cancers by validated immunohistochemistry as the standard for predicting which patients may benefit from endocrine therapy, and no other assays are recommended for this purpose. Breast cancer samples with 1% to 100% of tumor nuclei positive should be interpreted as ER positive. However, the Expert Panel acknowledges that there are limited data on endocrine therapy benefit for cancers with 1% to 10% of cells staining ER positive. Samples with these results should be reported using a new reporting category, ER Low Positive, with a recommended comment. A sample is considered ER negative if < 1% or 0% of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive. Additional strategies recommended to promote optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of cases with an initial low to no ER staining result include establishing a laboratory-specific standard operating procedure describing additional steps used by the laboratory to confirm/adjudicate results. The status of controls should be reported for cases with 0% to 10% staining. Similar principles apply to PgR testing, which is used primarily for prognostic purposes in the setting of an ER-positive cancer. Testing of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for ER is recommended to determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies to reduce risk of future breast cancer, while testing DCIS for PgR is considered optional.

        "abstract": "Background: A tumour-bed boost delivered after whole-breast radiotherapy increases local cancer-control rates but requires more patient visits and can increase breast hardness. IMPORT HIGH tested simultaneous integrated boost against sequential boost with the aim of reducing treatment duration while maintaining excellent local control and similar or reduced toxicity. Methods: IMPORT HIGH is a phase 3, non-inferiority, open-label, randomised controlled trial that recruited women after breast-conserving surgery for pT1-3pN0-3aM0 invasive carcinoma from radiotherapy and referral centres in the UK. Patients were randomly allocated to receive one of three treatments in a 1:1:1 ratio, with computer-generated random permuted blocks used to stratify patients by centre. The control group received 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast and 16 Gy in 8 fractions sequential photon tumour-bed boost. Test group 1 received 36 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast, 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the partial breast, and 48 Gy in 15 fractions concomitant photon boost to the tumour-bed volume. Test group 2 received 36 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast, 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the partial breast, and 53 Gy in 15 fractions concomitant photon boost to the tumour-bed volume. The boost clinical target volume was the clip-defined tumour bed. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour relapse (IBTR) analysed by intention to treat; assuming 5% 5-year incidence with the control group, non-inferiority was predefined as 3% or less absolute excess in the test groups (upper limit of two-sided 95% CI). Adverse events were assessed by clinicians, patients, and photographs. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN47437448, and is closed to new participants. Results: Between March 4, 2009, and Sept 16, 2015, 2617 patients were recruited. 871 individuals were assigned to the control group, 874 to test group 1, and 872 to test group 2. Median boost clinical target volume was 13 cm  (IQR 7 to 22). At a median follow-up of 74 months there were 76 IBTR events (20 for the control group, 21 for test group 1, and 35 for test group 2). 5-year IBTR incidence was 1·9% (95% CI 1·2 to 3·1) for the control group, 2·0% (1·2 to 3·2) for test group 1, and 3·2% (2·2 to 4·7) for test group 2. The estimated absolute differences versus the control group were 0·1% (-0·8 to 1·7) for test group 1 and 1·4% (0·03 to 3·8) for test group 2. The upper confidence limit for test group 1 versus the control group indicated non-inferiority for 48 Gy. Cumulative 5-year incidence of clinician-reported moderate or marked breast induration was 11·5% for the control group, 10·6% for test group 1 (p=0·40 vs control group), and 15·5% for test group 2 (p=0·015 vs control group). Conclusion: In all groups 5-year IBTR incidence was lower than the 5% originally expected regardless of boost sequencing. Dose-escalation is not advantageous. 5-year moderate or marked adverse event rates were low using small boost volumes. Simultaneous integrated boost in IMPORT HIGH was safe and reduced patient visits.",

        "abstract": "Background: This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on appropriate indications and techniques for partial breast irradiation (PBI) for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ. Methods: ASTRO convened a task force to address 4 key questions focused on the appropriate indications and techniques for PBI as an alternative to whole breast irradiation (WBI) to result in similar rates of ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR) and toxicity outcomes. Also addressed were aspects related to the technical delivery of PBI, including dose-fractionation regimens, target volumes, and treatment parameters for different PBI techniques. The guideline is based on a systematic review provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Recommendations were created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. Results: PBI delivered using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, multicatheter brachytherapy, and single-entry brachytherapy results in similar IBR as WBI with long-term follow-up. Some patient characteristics and tumor features were underrepresented in the randomized controlled trials, making it difficult to fully define IBR risks for patients with these features. Appropriate dose-fractionation regimens, target volume delineation, and treatment planning parameters for delivery of PBI are outlined. Intraoperative radiation therapy alone is associated with a higher IBR rate compared with WBI. A daily or every-other-day external beam PBI regimen is preferred over twice-daily regimens due to late toxicity concerns.

        "abstract": "Background: Several randomised, phase 3 trials have investigated the value of different techniques of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for patients with early breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery compared with whole-breast irradiation. In a phase 3 randomised trial, we evaluated whether APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy is non-inferior compared with whole-breast irradiation. Here, we present the 10-year follow-up results. Methods: We did a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial at 16 hospitals and medical centres in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and Switzerland. Patients aged 40 years or older with early invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ treated with breast-conserving surgery were centrally randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either whole-breast irradiation or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with a supplemental boost of 10 Gy to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 30·1 Gy (seven fractions) and 32·0 Gy (eight fractions) of high-dose-rate brachytherapy in 5 days or as 50 Gy of pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy over 5 treatment days. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local recurrence, analysed in the as-treated population; the non-inferiority margin for the recurrence rate difference (defined for 5-year results) was 3 percentage points. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  ; the trial is complete. Results: Between April 20, 2004, and July 30, 2009, 1328 female patients were randomly assigned to whole breast irradiation (n=673) or APBI (n=655), of whom 551 in the whole-breast irradiation group and 633 in the APBI group were eligible for analysis. At a median follow-up of 10·36 years (IQR 9·12-11·28), the 10-year local recurrence rates were 1·58% (95% CI 0·37 to 2·8) in the whole-breast irradiation group and 3·51% (1·99 to 5·03) in the APBI group. The difference in 10-year rates between the groups was 1·93% (95% CI -0·018 to 3·87; p=0·074). Adverse events were mostly grade 1 and 2, in 234 (60%) of 393 participants in the whole-breast irradiation group and 314 (67%) of 470 participants in the APBI group, at 7·5-year or 10-year follow-up, or both. Patients in the APBI group had a significantly lower incidence of treatment-related grade 3 late side-effects than those in the whole-breast irradiation group (17 [4%] of 393 for whole-breast irradiation vs seven [1%] of 470 for APBI; p=0·021; at 7·5-year or 10-year follow-up, or both). At 10 years, the most common type of grade 3 adverse event in both treatment groups was fibrosis (six [2%] of 313 patients for whole-breast irradiation and three [1%] of 375 patients for APBI, p=0·56). No grade 4 adverse events or treatment-related deaths have been observed. Conclusion: Postoperative APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early breast cancer is a valuable alternative to whole-breast irradiation in terms of treatment efficacy and is associated with fewer late side-effects.",

        "abstract": "Background: Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC), commonly used as a proliferation marker in breast cancer, has limited value for treatment decisions due to questionable analytical validity. The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group (IKWG) consensus meeting, held in October 2019, assessed the current evidence for Ki67 IHC analytical validity and clinical utility in breast cancer, including the series of scoring studies the IKWG conducted on centrally stained tissues. Consensus observations and recommendations are: 1) as for estrogen receptor and HER2 testing, preanalytical handling considerations are critical; 2) a standardized visual scoring method has been established and is recommended for adoption; 3) participation in and evaluation of quality assurance and quality control programs is recommended to maintain analytical validity; and 4) the IKWG accepted that Ki67 IHC as a prognostic marker in breast cancer has clinical validity but concluded that clinical utility is evident only for prognosis estimation in anatomically favorable estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative patients to identify those who do not need adjuvant chemotherapy. In this T1-2, N0-1 patient group, the IKWG consensus is that Ki67 5% or less, or 30% or more, can be used to estimate prognosis. In conclusion, analytical validity of Ki67 IHC can be reached with careful attention to preanalytical issues and calibrated standardized visual scoring. Currently, clinical utility of Ki67 IHC in breast cancer care remains limited to prognosis assessment in stage I or II breast cancer. Further development of automated scoring might help to overcome some current limitations.",

        "abstract": "Background: Radiotherapy has become much better targeted since the 1980s, improving both safety and efficacy. In breast cancer, radiotherapy to regional lymph nodes aims to reduce risks of recurrence and death. Its effects have been studied in randomised trials, some before the 1980s and some after. We aimed to assess the effects of regional node radiotherapy in these two eras. Methods: In this meta-analysis of individual patient data, we sought data from all randomised trials of regional lymph node radiotherapy versus no regional lymph node radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer (including one study that irradiated lymph nodes only if the cancer was right-sided). Trials were identified through the EBCTCG's regular systematic searches of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts. Trials were eligible if they began before Jan 1, 2009. The only systematic difference between treatment groups was in regional node radiotherapy (to the internal mammary chain, supraclavicular fossa, or axilla, or any combinations of these). Primary outcomes were recurrence at any site, breast cancer mortality, non-breast-cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. Data were supplied by trialists and standardised into a format suitable for analysis. A summary of the formatted data was returned to trialists for verification. Log-rank analyses yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals. Results: We found 17 eligible trials, 16 of which had available data (for 14 324 participants), and one of which (henceforth excluded), had unavailable data (for 165 participants). In the eight newer trials (12 167 patients), which started during 1989-2008, regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced recurrence (rate ratio 0·88, 95% CI 0·81-0·95; p=0·0008). The main effect was on distant recurrence as few regional node recurrences were reported. Radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality (RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·80-0·94; p=0·0010), with no significant effect on non-breast-cancer mortality (0·97, 0·84-1·11; p=0·63), leading to significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0·90, 0·84-0·96; p=0·0022). In an illustrative calculation, estimated absolute reductions in 15-year breast cancer mortality were 1·6% for women with no positive axillary nodes, 2·7% for those with one to three positive axillary nodes, and 4·5% for those with four or more positive axillary nodes. In the eight older trials (2157 patients), which started during 1961-78, regional node radiotherapy had little effect on breast cancer mortality (RR 1·04, 95% CI 0·91-1·20; p=0·55), but significantly increased non-breast-cancer mortality (1·42, 1·18-1·71; p=0·00023), with risk mainly after year 20, and all-cause mortality (1·17, 1·04-1·31; p=0·0067). Conclusion: Regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in trials done after the 1980s, but not in older trials. These contrasting findings could reflect radiotherapy improvements since the 1980s.",

        "abstract": "Background: To examine the impact of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) on breast cancer treatment decisions and adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) guidelines. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted involving 1,977 patients at high risk for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer from the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Ten oncologists provided blinded treatment recommendations for an average of 198 patients before and after viewing therapeutic options offered by the CDSS. Univariable and bivariable analyses of treatment changes were performed, and multivariable logistic regressions were estimated to examine the effects of physician experience (years), patient age, and receptor subtype/TNM stage. Results: Treatment decisions changed in 105 (5%) of 1,977 patients and were concentrated in those with hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease or stage IV disease in the first-line therapy setting (73% and 58%, respectively). Logistic regressions showed that decision changes were more likely in those with HR-positive cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.58;   < .05) and less likely in those with stage IIA (OR, 0.29;   < .05) or IIIA cancer (OR, 0.08;   < .01). Reasons cited for changes included consideration of the CDSS therapeutic options (63% of patients), patient factors highlighted by the tool (23%), and the decision logic of the tool (13%). Patient age and oncologist experience were not associated with decision changes. Adherence to NCCN treatment guidelines increased slightly after using the CDSS (0.5%;   = .003). Conclusion: Use of an artificial intelligence-based CDSS had a significant impact on treatment decisions and NCCN guideline adherence in HR-positive breast cancers. Although cases of stage IV disease in the first-line therapy setting were also more likely to be changed, the effect was not statistically significant (  = .22). Additional research on decision impact, patient-physician communication, learning, and clinical outcomes is needed to establish the overall value of the technology.",

        "abstract": "Background: Sacituzumab govitecan demonstrated significant progression-free survival benefit over chemotherapy in the phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial in patients with pretreated, endocrine-resistant hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+ and HER2-) metastatic breast cancer with limited treatment options. Here, we report the protocol-specified final analysis of overall survival and endpoints by trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) expression and other variables. Methods: In this randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial, which took place in 91 centres across North America (the USA and Canada) and Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive sacituzumab govitecan or chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine). Patients had confirmed HR+ and HER2- locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer and had received at least one previous endocrine therapy, a taxane, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor in any setting and two to four previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (previously reported and not included in this analysis), and secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), and patient-reported outcomes. Overall survival was assessed using stratified log-rank tests and Cox regression. Trop-2 expression was assessed in tumour tissue by immunohistochemistry. In the statistical testing hierarchy, ORR and patient-reported outcomes were tested sequentially if overall survival was significant. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: At the data cutoff date of July 1, 2022, 543 of 776 screened patients were randomly assigned between May 30, 2019, and April 5, 2021, with 272 patients in the sacituzumab govitecan group and 271 patients in the chemotherapy group. With a 12·5-month (IQR 6·4-18·8) median follow-up, 390 deaths occurred among 543 patients. Overall survival was significantly improved with sacituzumab govitecan versus chemotherapy (median 14·4 months [95% CI 13·0-15·7] vs 11·2 months [10·1-12·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·65-0·96; p=0·020); survival benefit was consistent across Trop-2 expression-level subgroups. ORR was significantly improved with sacituzumab govitecan compared with chemotherapy (57 [21%] patients vs 38 [14%]; odds ratio 1·63 [95% CI 1·03-2·56]; p=0·035), as was time to deterioration of global health status and quality of life (median 4·3 months vs 3·0 months; HR 0·75 [0·61-0·92]; p=0·0059) and fatigue (median 2·2 months vs 1·4 months; HR 0·73 [0·60-0·89]; p=0·0021). The safety profile of sacituzumab govitecan was consistent with previous studies (including the TROPiCS-02 primary analysis and the ASCENT trial). One fatal adverse event (septic shock caused by neutropenic colitis) was determined to be related to sacituzumab govitecan treatment. Conclusion: Sacituzumab govitecan demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit over chemotherapy, with a 3·2-month median overall survival improvement and a manageable safety profile. These data support sacituzumab govitecan as a new treatment option for patients with pretreated, endocrine-resistant HR+ and HER2- metastatic breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the TNT trial of triple negative breast cancer ( ), germline BRCA1/2 mutations were present in 28% of carboplatin responders. We assessed quantitative measures of structural chromosomal instability (CIN) to identify a wider patient subgroup within TNT with preferential benefit from carboplatin over docetaxel. Methods: Copy number aberrations (CNAs) were established from 135 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary carcinomas using Illumina OmniExpress SNP-arrays. Seven published [allelic imbalanced CNA (AiCNA); allelic balanced CNA (AbCNA); copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CnLOH); number of telomeric allelic imbalances (NtAI); BRCA1-like status; percentage of genome altered (PGA); homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores] and two novel [Shannon diversity index (SI); high-level amplifications (HLAMP)] CIN-measurements were derived. HLAMP was defined based on the presence of at least one of the top 5% amplified cytobands located on 1q, 8q and 10p. Continuous CIN-measurements were divided into tertiles. All nine CIN-measurements were used to analyse objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Patients with tumours without HLAMP had a numerically higher ORR and significantly longer PFS in the carboplatin (C) than in the docetaxel (D) arm [56% (C) versus 29% (D), P  = 0.085; PFS 6.1 months (C) versus 4.1 months (D), P  = 0.047]. In the carboplatin arm, patients with tumours showing intermediate telomeric NtAI and AiCNA had higher ORR [54% (C) versus 20% (D), P  = 0.03; 62% (C) versus 33% (D), P  = 0.076]. Patients with high AiCNA and PGA had shorter PFS in the carboplatin arm [3.4 months (high) versus 5.7 months (low/intermediate); and 3.8 months (high) versus 5.6 months (low/intermediate), respectively; P  = 0.027, P  = 0.125 and P  = 0.053, P  = 0.176], whilst no difference was observed in the docetaxel arm. Conclusion: Patients with tumours lacking HLAMP and demonstrating intermediate CIN-measurements formed a subgroup benefitting from carboplatin relative to docetaxel treatment within the TNT trial. This suggests a complex and paradoxical relationship between the extent of genomic instability in primary tumours and treatment response in the metastatic setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: Endocrine therapy (ET) and ET-based regimens are the preferred first-line treatment options for hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer (HR+/HER2- MBC), while chemotherapy (CT) is commonly used in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and clinical outcome of ET and CT as first-line treatment in Chinese patients with HR+/HER2- MBC. Methods: Patients diagnosed with HR+/HER2-MBC between January 1st, 1996 and September 30th, 2018 were screened from the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer database. The initial and maintenance first-line treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: Among the 1877 included patients, 1215 (64.7%) received CT and 662 (35.3%) received ET as initial first-line treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in PFS and OS between patients receiving ET and CT as initial first-line treatment in the total population (PFS: 12.0 vs. 11.0 months, P = 0.22; OS: 54.0 vs . 49.0 months, P =0.09) and propensity score matched population. For patients without disease progression after at least 3 months of initial therapy, maintenance ET following initial CT (CT-ET cohort, n = 449) and continuous schedule of ET (ET cohort, n = 527) had longer PFS than continuous schedule of CT (CT cohort, n = 406) in the total population (CT-ET cohort vs. CT cohort: 17.0 vs . 8.5 months; P <0.01; ET cohort vs . CT cohort: 14.0 vs . 8.5 months; P <0.01) and propensity score matched population. OS in the three cohorts yielded the same results as PFS. Conclusion: ET was associated with similar clinical outcome to CT as initial first-line treatment. For patients without disease progression after initial CT, switching to maintenance ET showed superiority in clinical outcome over continuous schedule of CT.",

        "abstract": "Background: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer have persistent, long-term risk of breast-cancer recurrence and death. Therefore, trials assessing endocrine therapies for this patient population need extended follow-up. We present an update of efficacy outcomes in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study at 8·1 years median follow-up. Methods: BIG 1-98 is a randomised, phase 3, double-blind trial of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer that compares 5 years of tamoxifen or letrozole monotherapy, or sequential treatment with 2 years of one of these drugs followed by 3 years of the other. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks, and stratified according to the two-arm or four-arm randomisation option, participating institution, and chemotherapy use. Patients, investigators, data managers, and medical reviewers were masked. The primary efficacy endpoint was disease-free survival (events were invasive breast cancer relapse, second primaries [contralateral breast and non-breast], or death without previous cancer event). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI). The monotherapy comparison included patients randomly assigned to tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years. In 2005, after a significant disease-free survival benefit was reported for letrozole as compared with tamoxifen, a protocol amendment facilitated the crossover to letrozole of patients who were still receiving tamoxifen alone; Cox models and Kaplan-Meier estimates with inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) are used to account for selective crossover to letrozole of patients (n=619) in the tamoxifen arm. Comparison of sequential treatments to letrozole monotherapy included patients enrolled and randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, or tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. Treatment has ended for all patients and detailed safety results for adverse events that occurred during the 5 years of treatment have been reported elsewhere. Follow-up is continuing for those enrolled in the four-arm option. BIG 1-98 is registered at clinicaltrials.gov . Results: 8010 patients were included in the trial, with a median follow-up of 8·1 years (range 0-12·4). 2459 were randomly assigned to monotherapy with tamoxifen for 5 years and 2463 to monotherapy with letrozole for 5 years. In the four-arm option of the trial, 1546 were randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, 1548 to tamoxifen for 5 years, 1540 to letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, and 1548 to tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. At a median follow-up of 8·7 years from randomisation (range 0-12·4), letrozole monotherapy was significantly better than tamoxifen, whether by IPCW or intention-to-treat analysis (IPCW disease-free survival HR 0·82 [95% CI 0·74-0·92], overall survival HR 0·79 [0·69-0·90], DRFI HR 0·79 [0·68-0·92], BCFI HR 0·80 [0·70-0·92]; intention-to-treat disease-free survival HR 0·86 [0·78-0·96], overall survival HR 0·87 [0·77-0·999], DRFI HR 0·86 [0·74-0·998], BCFI HR 0·86 [0·76-0·98]). At a median follow-up of 8·0 years from randomisation (range 0-11·2) for the comparison of the sequential groups with letrozole monotherapy, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the four endpoints for either sequence. 8-year intention-to-treat estimates (each with SE ≤1·1%) for letrozole monotherapy, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, and tamoxifen followed by letrozole were 78·6%, 77·8%, 77·3% for disease-free survival; 87·5%, 87·7%, 85·9% for overall survival; 89·9%, 88·7%, 88·1% for DRFI; and 86·1%, 85·3%, 84·3% for BCFI. Conclusion: For postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer, a reduction in breast cancer recurrence and mortality is obtained by letrozole monotherapy when compared with tamoxifen montherapy. Sequential treatments involving tamoxifen and letrozole do not improve outcome compared with letrozole monotherapy, but might be useful strategies when considering an individual patient's risk of recurrence and treatment tolerability.",

Methods: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with HR+/HER2- MBC whose cancer progressed during ET and CDK4/6i, participants switched ET (fulvestrant or exemestane) from ET used pre-random assignment and randomly assigned 1:1 to the CDK4/6i ribociclib versus placebo. PFS was the primary end point, defined as time from random assignment to disease progression or death. Assuming a median PFS of 3.8 months with placebo, we had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (corresponding to a median PFS of at least 6.5 months with ribociclib) with 120 patients randomly assigned using a one-sided log-rank test and significance level set at 2.5%. Results: Of the 119 randomly assigned participants, 103 (86.5%) previously received palbociclib and 14 participants received ribociclib (11.7%). There was a statistically significant PFS improvement for patients randomly assigned to switched ET plus ribociclib (median, 5.29 months; 95% CI, 3.02 to 8.12 months) versus switched ET plus placebo (median, 2.76 months; 95% CI, 2.66 to 3.25 months) HR, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.85);   = .006. At 6 and 12 months, the PFS rate was 41.2% and 24.6% with ribociclib, respectively, compared with 23.9% and 7.4% with placebo. Conclusion: In this randomized trial, there was a significant PFS benefit for patients with HR+/HER2- MBC who switched ET and received ribociclib compared with placebo after previous CDK4/6i and different ET.",

Women with HER2-positive MBC who had not undergone HER2 blockade or chemotherapy for metastatic disease were enrolled in the study and received daily oral pyrotinib 400 mg plus intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m  every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival (OS) and safety. From June 2019 to June 2021, 79 patients were enrolled. The confirmed ORR was 79.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.8-88.6), and the CBR was 87.3% (95%CI, 80.0-94.6) in the intention-to-treat population. The pre-specified primary endpoint was met.

A randomized phase II trial showed significant benefit for gemcitabine, carboplatin, and iniparib (GCI) over gemcitabine and carboplatin (GC) in clinical benefit rate, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Here, we formally compare the efficacy of these regimens in a phase III trial. Methods: Patients with stage IV/locally recurrent TNBC who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for mTNBC were randomly allocated to gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) and carboplatin area under the curve 2 (days 1 and 8) alone or GC plus iniparib 5.6 mg/kg (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) every 3 weeks. Random assignment was stratified by the number of prior chemotherapies. The coprimary end points were OS and PFS. Patients receiving GC could cross over to iniparib on progression. Results: Five hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned (261 GCI; 258 GC). In the primary analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.12; P = .28) nor PFS (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; P = .027). An exploratory analysis showed that patients in the second-/third-line had improved OS (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.91) and PFS (HR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.92) with GCI. The safety profile for GCI was similar to GC. Conclusion: The trial did not meet the prespecified criteria for the coprimary end points of PFS and OS in the ITT population. The potential benefit with iniparib observed in second-/third-line subgroup warrants further evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Background: Adjuvant radiotherapy is prescribed after breast-conserving surgery to reduce the risk of local recurrence. However, radiotherapy is inconvenient, costly, and associated with both short-term and long-term side effects. Clinicopathologic factors alone are of limited use in the identification of women at low risk for local recurrence in whom radiotherapy can be omitted. Molecularly defined intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer can provide additional prognostic information. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study involving women who were at least 55 years of age, had undergone breast-conserving surgery for T1N0 (tumor size <2 cm and node negative), grade 1 or 2, luminal A-subtype breast cancer (defined as estrogen receptor positivity of ≥1%, progesterone receptor positivity of >20%, negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki67 index of ≤13.25%), and had received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients who met the clinical eligibility criteria were registered, and Ki67 immunohistochemical analysis was performed centrally. Patients with a Ki67 index of 13.25% or less were enrolled and did not receive radiotherapy. The primary outcome was local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast. In consultation with radiation oncologists and patients with breast cancer, we determined that if the upper boundary of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the cumulative incidence at 5 years was less than 5%, this would represent an acceptable risk of local recurrence at 5 years. Results: Of 740 registered patients, 500 eligible patients were enrolled. At 5 years after enrollment, recurrence was reported in 2.3% of the patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.1), a result that met the prespecified boundary. Breast cancer occurred in the contralateral breast in 1.9% of the patients (90% CI, 1.1 to 3.2), and recurrence of any type was observed in 2.7% (90% CI, 1.6 to 4.1). Conclusion: Among women who were at least 55 years of age and had T1N0, grade 1 or 2, luminal A breast cancer that were treated with breast-conserving surgery and endocrine therapy alone, the incidence of local recurrence at 5 years was low with the omission of radiotherapy.

The results of the final analysis of overall survival have not been reported. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks plus the investigator's choice of chemotherapy (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine-carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. The primary end points were progression-free survival (reported previously) and overall survival among patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a CPS of 10 or more (the CPS-10 subgroup), among patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a CPS of 1 or more (the CPS-1 subgroup), and in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also assessed. Results: A total of 847 patients underwent randomization: 566 were assigned to the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group, and 281 to the placebo-chemotherapy group. The median follow-up was 44.1 months. In the CPS-10 subgroup, the median overall survival was 23.0 months in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 16.1 months in the placebo-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.95; two-sided P = 0.0185 [criterion for significance met]); in the CPS-1 subgroup, the median overall survival was 17.6 and 16.0 months in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.04; two-sided P = 0.1125 [not significant]); and in the intention-to-treat population, the median overall survival was 17.2 and 15.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.05 [significance not tested]). Adverse events of grade 3, 4, or 5 that were related to the trial regimen occurred in 68.1% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and in 66.9% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and in no patients in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Conclusion: Among patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a CPS of 10 or more, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone.

We further assessed addition of pyrotinib to trastuzumab and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting. Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 study (PHEDRA), treatment-naive women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of oral pyrotinib or placebo (400 mg) once daily, plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg) and docetaxel (100 mg/m ) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/is and ypN0) rate per independent central review. Results: Between Jul 23, 2018, and Jan 8, 2021, 355 patients were randomly assigned, 178 to the pyrotinib group and 177 to the placebo group. The majority of patients completed four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment as planned (92.7% and 97.7% in the pyrotinib and placebo groups, respectively). The tpCR rate was 41.0% (95% CI 34.0 to 48.4) in the pyrotinib group compared with 22.0% (95% CI 16.6 to 28.7) in the placebo group (difference, 19.0% [95% CI 9.5 to 28.4]; one-sided P < 0.0001). The objective response rate per investigator was 91.6% (95% CI 86.6 to 94.8) in the pyrotinib group and 81.9% (95% CI 75.6 to 86.9) in the placebo group after the neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in an increase of 9.7% (95% CI 2.7 to 16.6). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhea (79 [44.4%] in the pyrotinib group and nine [5.1%] in the placebo group), neutropenia (33 [18.5%] and 36 [20.3%]), and decreased white blood cell count (29 [16.3%] and 24 [13.6%]). No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant treatment. Conclusion: The primary endpoint of the study was met.

Here, we report the final overall survival (OS) analysis and updates of other endpoints. Methods: In total, 405 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive utidelone (30 mg/m  IV daily, days 1-5, over 90 min) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m  orally b.i.d., days 1-14) or capecitabine alone (1250 mg/m  orally b.i.d., days 1-14) every 21 days. The secondary endpoint, OS, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit approach at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 after the prespecified 310 death events had been reached. Exploratory analyses of the primary endpoint, PFS, and the secondary endpoint, ORR, were also done. Safety was analysed in patients who had at least one dose of study drug. Results: At the final OS analysis, the median duration of follow-up was 19.6 months in the utidelone plus capecitabine group and 15.4 months in the capecitabine alone group. In the intention-to-treat population, 313 deaths had occurred at data cut-off, 203 of 270 patients in the combination group and 110 of 135 in the monotherapy group. Median OS in the combination group was 19.8 months compared with 16.0 months in the monotherapy group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.75, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.59-0.94, P = 0.0142]. The updated analysis of PFS and ORR showed that the combination therapy remained superior to monotherapy. Safety results were similar to those previously reported with respect to incidence, severity and specificity. No late-emerging toxicities or new safety concerns occurred. Conclusion: For heavily-pretreated, anthracycline- and taxane-resistant MBC patients, utidelone plus capecitabine significantly improved OS versus capecitabine alone. These results support the use of utidelone plus capecitabine as a novel therapeutic regimen for patients with MBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: Various randomized trials have demonstrated that postmastectomy radiotherapy (RT) to the chest wall and comprehensive regional nodal areas improves survival in patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer. Controversy exists as to whether the internal mammary node (IMN) region is an essential component of regional nodal irradiation. Available data on the survival benefit of IMN irradiation (IMNI) are conflicting. The patient populations enrolled in previous studies were heterogeneous and most studies were conducted before modern systemic treatment and three-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy (RT) techniques were introduced. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of IMNI in the context of modern systemic treatment and computed tomography (CT)-based RT planning techniques. Methods: POTENTIAL is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, parallel, phase III, randomized controlled trial investigating whether IMNI improves disease-free survival (DFS) in high-risk breast cancer with positive axillary nodes (pN+) after mastectomy. A total of 1800 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive IMNI or not. All patients are required to receive ≥ six cycles of anthracycline and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. Randomization will be stratified by institution, tumor location (medial/central vs. other quadrants), the number of positive axillary nodes (1-3 vs. 4-9 vs. ≥10), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no). Treatment will be delivered with CT-based 3D RT techniques, including 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, or volumetric modulated arc therapy. The prescribed dose is 50 Gy in 25 fractions or 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions. Tiered RT quality assurance is required. After RT, patients will be followed up at regular intervals. Oncological and toxilogical outcomes, especially cardiac toxicities, will be assessed. Results: This trial design is intended to overcome the limitations of previous prospective studies by recruiting patients with pN+ breast cancer, using DFS as the primary endpoint, and prospectively assessing cardiac toxicities and requiring RT quality assurance. The results of this study will provide high-level evidence for elective IMNI in patients with breast cancer after mastectomy. Conclusion: ClinicalTrails.gov ,   .

        "abstract": "Background: Adding CDK4/6 inhibitor dalpiciclib to fulvestrant significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer progressing after endocrine therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dalpiciclib plus letrozole or anastrozole in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had no previous systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Methods: DAWNA-2 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 42 hospitals in China. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, of any menopausal status, had an ECOG performance status of 0-1, and had pathologically confirmed hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative untreated advanced breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral dalpiciclib (150 mg per day for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off) or matching placebo. Both groups also received endocrine therapy: either 2·5 mg letrozole or 1 mg anastrozole orally once daily continuously. Randomisation was using an interactive web response system (block size of six) and stratified according to visceral metastasis, previous endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, and endocrine therapy partner. All investigators, patients, and the funders of the study were masked to group allocation. We present the results of the preplanned interim analyses for the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival, which was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who met the eligibility criteria by intention-to treat. Safety was analysed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The superiority boundary was calculated as a one-sided p value of 0·0076 or less. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is ongoing but closed to recruitment. Results: Between July 19, 2019, and Dec 25, 2020, 580 patients were screened and 456 were eligible and randomly assigned to the dalpiciclib group (n=303) or placebo group (n=153). At data cutoff (June 1, 2022), median follow-up was 21·6 months (IQR 18·3-25·9), and 103 (34%) of 303 patients in the dalpiciclib group and 83 (54%) of 153 patients in the placebo group had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the dalpiciclib group than in the placebo group (30·6 months [95% CI 30·6-not reached] vs 18·2 months [16·5-22·5]; stratified hazard ratio 0·51 [95% CI 0·38-0·69]; one-sided log-rank p<0·0001). Adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 271 (90%) of 302 patients in the dalpiciclib group and 18 (12%) of 153 patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (259 [86%] in the dalpiciclib group vs none in the placebo group) and leukopenia (201 [67%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported for 36 (12%) patients in the dalpiciclib group and ten (7%) patients in the placebo group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred, both in the dalpiciclib group (deaths from unknown causes). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that dalpiciclib plus letrozole or anastrozole could be a novel standard first-line treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and is an alternative option to the current treatment landscape.",

        "abstract": "Background: Aromatase inhibitors are a standard of care for hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. We investigated whether the selective oestrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant could improve progression-free survival compared with anastrozole in postmenopausal patients who had not received previous endocrine therapy. Methods: In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial, we recruited eligible patients with histologically confirmed oestrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive, or both, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer from 113 academic hospitals and community centres in 20 countries. Eligible patients were endocrine therapy-naive, with WHO performance status 0-2, and at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular injection; on days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 days thereafter) or anastrozole (1 mg orally daily) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1·1, intervention by surgery or radiotherapy because of disease deterioration, or death from any cause, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of randomised treatment (including placebo). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between Oct 17, 2012, and July 11, 2014, 524 patients were enrolled to this study. Of these, 462 patients were randomised (230 to receive fulvestrant and 232 to receive anastrozole). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the fulvestrant group than in the anastrozole group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·797, 95% CI 0·637-0·999, p=0·0486). Median progression-free survival was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·83-20·99) in the fulvestrant group versus 13·8 months (11·99-16·59) in the anastrozole group. The most common adverse events were arthralgia (38 [17%] in the fulvestrant group vs 24 [10%] in the anastrozole group) and hot flushes (26 [11%] in the fulvestrant group vs 24 [10%] in the anastrozole group). 16 (7%) of 228 patients in in the fulvestrant group and 11 (5%) of 232 patients in the anastrozole group discontinued because of adverse events. Conclusion: Fulvestrant has superior efficacy and is a preferred treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received previous endocrine therapy compared with a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, a standard of care for first-line treatment of these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tucidinostat (formerly known as chidamide) is an oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor. In an exploratory study, the combination of tucidinostat with exemestane showed preliminary signs of encouraging anti-tumour activity in patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. To build on these findings, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of this combination in a randomised trial in a larger population of postmenopausal patients with advanced, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Methods: We did the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 ACE trial at 22 specialist cancer centres in China. Eligible patients were postmenopausal women (aged ≥60 years or aged <60 years if their serum follicle-stimulating hormone and oestradiol concentrations were within postmenopausal ranges) with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, whose disease had relapsed or progressed after at least one endocrine therapy (either in advanced or metastatic or adjuvant setting), and who had at least one measurable lesion, adequate organ function, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate haematological and biochemical parameters. Endocrine therapy did not have to be the most recent therapy before randomisation, but recurrence or progression after the most recent therapy was a prerequisite. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) by a dynamic randomisation scheme via an interactive web-response system to receive 30 mg oral tucidinostat or placebo twice weekly. All patients in both groups also received 25 mg oral exemestane daily. Randomisation was stratified according to the presence of visceral metastases (yes vs no). Patients, investigators, study site staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the full analysis set population, comprising all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment and for whom at least one safety case report form was available. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . The study has reached the required number of events for final analysis of the primary endpoint. The trial is no longer enrolling patients, but follow-up for investigation of overall survival is ongoing. Results: Between July 20, 2015, and June 26, 2017, 365 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 244 to the tucidinostat group and 121 to the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up was 13·9 months (IQR 9·8-17·5). Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 7·4 months (95% CI 5·5-9·2) in the tucidinostat group and 3·8 months (3·7-5·5) in the placebo group (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·58-0·98]; p=0·033). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in either group were neutropenia (124 [51%] of 244 patients in the tucidinostat group vs three [2%] of 121 patients in the placebo group), thrombocytopenia (67 [27%] vs three [2%]), and leucopenia (46 [19%] vs three [2%]). Serious adverse events of any cause occurred in 51 (21%) of 244 patients in the tucidinostat group and seven (6%) of 121 patients in the placebo group. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: Tucidinostat plus exemestane improved progression-free survival compared with placebo plus exemestane in patients with advanced, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that progressed after previous endocrine therapy. Grade 3-4 haematological adverse events were more common in the tucidinostat plus exemestane group than in the placebo plus exemestane group. Tucidinostat plus exemestane could represent a new treatment option for these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Ribociclib has been shown to have a significant overall survival benefit in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Whether this benefit in advanced breast cancer extends to early breast cancer is unclear. Methods: In this international, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive ribociclib (at a dose of 400 mg per day for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off, for 3 years) plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI; letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg per day or anastrozole at a dose of 1 mg per day for ≥5 years) or an NSAI alone. Premenopausal women and men also received goserelin every 28 days. Eligible patients had anatomical stage II or III breast cancer. Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of invasive disease-free survival, the primary end point; other efficacy and safety results are also reported. Invasive disease-free survival was evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical comparison was made with the use of a stratified log-rank test, with a protocol-specified stopping boundary of a one-sided P-value threshold of 0.0128 for superior efficacy. Results: As of the data-cutoff date for this prespecified interim analysis (January 11, 2023), a total of 426 patients had had invasive disease, recurrence, or death. A significant invasive disease-free survival benefit was seen with ribociclib plus an NSAI as compared with an NSAI alone. At 3 years, invasive disease-free survival was 90.4% with ribociclib plus an NSAI and 87.1% with an NSAI alone (hazard ratio for invasive disease, recurrence, or death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.91; P = 0.003). Secondary end points - distant disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival - also favored ribociclib plus an NSAI. The 3-year regimen of ribociclib at a 400-mg starting dose plus an NSAI was not associated with any new safety signals. Conclusion: Ribociclib plus an NSAI significantly improved invasive disease-free survival among patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative stage II or III early breast cancer.

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review in the PD-L1-positive and intention-to-treat populations. The secondary end points included overall survival and safety. Overall, 200 and 100 patients, in the toripalimab and placebo arm respectively had PD-L1-positive TNBC. At the prespecified interim analysis, a statistically significant improvement in PFS assessed by a blinded independent central review was demonstrated in the experimental arm in the PD-L1-positive population (median PFS 8.4 versus 5.6 months; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.470-0.906, P = 0.0102).

        "abstract": "Background: Adjuvant breast radiotherapy as a standard component of breast-conserving treatment for early cancer can overtreat many women. Breast MRI is the most sensitive modality to assess local tumour burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether a combination of MRI and pathology findings can identify women with truly localised breast cancer who can safely avoid radiotherapy. Methods: PROSPECT is a prospective, multicentre, two-arm, non-randomised trial of radiotherapy omission in patients selected using preoperative MRI and postoperative tumour pathology. It is being conducted at four academic hospitals in Australia. Women aged 50 years or older with cT1N0 non-triple-negative breast cancer were eligible. Those with apparently unifocal cancer had breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and, if pT1N0 or N1mi, had radiotherapy omitted (group 1). Standard treatment including excision of MRI-detected additional cancers was offered to the others (group 2). All were recommended systemic therapy. The primary outcome was ipsilateral invasive recurrence rate (IIRR) at 5 years in group 1. Primary analysis occurred after the 100th group 1 patient reached 5 years follow-up. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of the PROSPECT pathway were analysed. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12610000810011). Results: Between May 17, 2011, and May 6, 2019, 443 patients with breast cancer underwent MRI. Median age was 63·0 years. MRI detected 61 malignant occult lesions separate from the index cancer in 48 patients (11%). Of 201 group 1 patients who had BCS without radiotherapy, the IIRR at 5 years was 1·0% (upper 95% CI 5·4%). In group 1, one local recurrence occurred at 4·5 years and a second at 7·5 years. In group 2, nine patients had mastectomy (2% of total cohort), and the 5-year IIRR was 1·7% (upper 95% CI 6·1%). The only distant metastasis in the entire cohort was genetically distinct from the index cancer. The PROSPECT pathway increased QALYs by 0·019 (95% CI 0·008-0·029) and saved AU$1980 (95% CI 1396-2528) or £953 (672-1216) per patient. Conclusion: PROSPECT suggests that women with unifocal breast cancer on MRI and favourable pathology can safely omit radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: On the basis of low risk of local recurrence in elderly patients with breast cancer after conservative surgery followed by whole breast irradiation (WBI), the Danish Breast Cancer Group initiated the noninferiority external-beam partial breast irradiation (PBI) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ). We hypothesized that PBI was noninferior to WBI regarding breast induration. Methods: Patients operated with breast conservation for relatively low-risk breast cancer were randomly assigned to WBI versus PBI, and all had 40 Gy/15 fractions. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration. Results: In total, 865 evaluable patients (434 WBI and 431 PBI) were enrolled between 2009 and 2016. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (morbidity) and 7.6 years (locoregional recurrence). The 3-year rate of induration was 9.7% for WBI and 5.1% for PBI (  = .014). Large breast size was significantly associated with induration with a 3-year incidence of 13% (WBI) and 6% (PBI) for large-breasted patients versus 6% (WBI) and 5% (PBI) for small-breasted patients. PBI showed no increased risk of dyspigmentation, telangiectasia, edema, or pain, and patient satisfaction was high. Letrozole and smoking did not increase the risk of radiation-associated morbidity. Sixteen patients had a locoregional recurrence (six WBI and 10 PBI;   = .28), 20 patients had a contralateral breast cancer, and eight patients had distant failure (five WBI and three PBI). A nonbreast second cancer was detected in 73 patients (8.4%), and there was no difference between groups. Conclusion: External-beam PBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer was noninferior to WBI in terms of breast induration. Large breast size was a risk factor for radiation-associated induration. Few recurrences were detected and unrelated to PBI.",

        "abstract": "Background: Limited level 1 evidence is available on the omission of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery in older women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy. Methods: We performed a phase 3 randomized trial of the omission of irradiation; the trial population included women 65 years of age or older who had hormone receptor-positive, node-negative, T1 or T2 primary breast cancer (with tumors ≤3 cm in the largest dimension) treated with breast-conserving surgery with clear excision margins and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation (40 to 50 Gy) or no irradiation. The primary end point was local breast cancer recurrence. Regional recurrence, breast cancer-specific survival, distant recurrence as the first event, and overall survival were also assessed. Results: A total of 1326 women were enrolled; 658 were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation and 668 to receive no irradiation. The median follow-up was 9.1 years. The cumulative incidence of local breast cancer recurrence within 10 years was 9.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8 to 12.3) in the no-radiotherapy group and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.1 to 1.7) in the radiotherapy group (hazard ratio, 10.4; 95% CI, 4.1 to 26.1; P<0.001). Although local recurrence was more common in the group that did not receive radiotherapy, the 10-year incidence of distant recurrence as the first event was not higher in the no-radiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy group, at 1.6% (95% CI, 0.4 to 2.8) and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.5), respectively. Overall survival at 10 years was almost identical in the two groups, at 80.8% (95% CI, 77.2 to 84.3) with no radiotherapy and 80.7% (95% CI, 76.9 to 84.3) with radiotherapy. The incidence of regional recurrence and breast cancer-specific survival also did not differ substantially between the two groups. Conclusion: Omission of radiotherapy was associated with an increased incidence of local recurrence but had no detrimental effect on distant recurrence as the first event or overall survival among women 65 years of age or older with low-risk, hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.

        "abstract": "Background: Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years as up-front monotherapy or after tamoxifen therapy is the treatment of choice for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Extending treatment with an aromatase inhibitor to 10 years may further reduce the risk of breast-cancer recurrence. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of the extended use of letrozole for an additional 5 years. Our primary end point was disease-free survival. Results: We enrolled 1918 women. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there were 165 events involving disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (67 with letrozole and 98 with placebo) and 200 deaths (100 in each group). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 96) with letrozole and 91% (95% CI; 89 to 93) with placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, 0.66; P=0.01 by a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to nodal status, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, the interval from the last dose of aromatase-inhibitor therapy, and the duration of treatment with tamoxifen). The rate of 5-year overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with letrozole and 94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.97; P=0.83). The annual incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in the letrozole group was 0.21% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32), and the rate in the placebo group was 0.49% (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.67) (hazard ratio, 0.42; P=0.007). Bone-related toxic effects occurred more frequently among patients receiving letrozole than among those receiving placebo, including a higher incidence of bone pain, bone fractures, and new-onset osteoporosis. No significant differences between letrozole and placebo were observed in scores on most subscales measuring quality of life. Conclusion: The extension of treatment with an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor to 10 years resulted in significantly higher rates of disease-free survival and a lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer than those with placebo, but the rate of overall survival was not higher with the aromatase inhibitor than with placebo.

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus targets aberrant signaling through the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, a mechanism of resistance to anti-estrogen therapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. We hypothesized that everolimus plus the selective ER downregulator fulvestrant would be more efficacious than fulvestrant alone in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study included 131 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer randomly assigned to fulvestrant (500 mg days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of cycles 2 and beyond) plus everolimus or placebo. The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% improvement in median progression-free survival from 5.4 months to 9.2 months. Secondary end points included objective response and clinical benefit rate (response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). Prophylactic corticosteroid mouth rinses were not used. Results The addition of everolimus to fulvestrant improved the median progression-free survival from 5.1 to 10.3 months (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92]; stratified log-rank P = .02), indicating that the primary trial end point was met. Objective response rates were similar (18.2% v 12.3%; P = .47), but the clinical benefit rate was significantly higher in the everolimus arm (63.6% v 41.5%; P = .01). Adverse events of all grades occurred more often in the everolimus arm, including oral mucositis (53% v 12%), fatigue (42% v 22%), rash (38% v 5%), anemia (31% v. 6%), diarrhea (23% v 8%), hyperglycemia (19% v 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (17% v 3%), and pneumonitis (17% v 0%), although grade 3 to 4 events were uncommon. Conclusion Everolimus enhances the efficacy of fulvestrant in AI-resistant, ER-positive metastatic breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Suppression of ovarian estrogen production reduces the recurrence of hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer in premenopausal women, but its value when added to tamoxifen is uncertain. Methods: We randomly assigned 3066 premenopausal women, stratified according to prior receipt or nonreceipt of chemotherapy, to receive 5 years of tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, or exemestane plus ovarian suppression. The primary analysis tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression would improve disease-free survival, as compared with tamoxifen alone. In the primary analysis, 46.7% of the patients had not received chemotherapy previously, and 53.3% had received chemotherapy and remained premenopausal. Results: After a median follow-up of 67 months, the estimated disease-free survival rate at 5 years was 86.6% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group and 84.7% in the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, second invasive cancer, or death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.04; P=0.10). Multivariable allowance for prognostic factors suggested a greater treatment effect with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression than with tamoxifen alone (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.98). Most recurrences occurred in patients who had received prior chemotherapy, among whom the rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was 82.5% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group and 78.0% in the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio for recurrence, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.02). At 5 years, the rate of freedom from breast cancer was 85.7% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for recurrence vs. tamoxifen, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.87). Conclusion: Adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not provide a significant benefit in the overall study population. However, for women who were at sufficient risk for recurrence to warrant adjuvant chemotherapy and who remained premenopausal, the addition of ovarian suppression improved disease outcomes. Further improvement was seen with the use of exemestane plus ovarian suppression. (Funded by Pfizer and others; SOFT ClinicalTrials.gov number,  .).",

        "abstract": "Background: Proton therapy is under investigation in breast cancer as a strategy to reduce radiation exposure to the heart and lungs. So far, studies investigating proton postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) have used conventional fractionation over 25-28 days, but whether hypofractionated proton PMRT is feasible is unclear. We aimed to compare conventional fractionation and hypofractionation in patients with indications for PMRT, including those with immediate breast reconstruction. Methods: We did a randomised phase 2 trial (MC1631) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester (MN, USA) and Mayo Clinic in Arizona (Phoenix, AZ, USA) comparing conventional fractionated (50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2 Gy [relative biological effectiveness of 1·1]) and hypofractionated (40·05 Gy in 15 fractions of 2·67 Gy [relative biological effectiveness of 1·1]) proton PMRT. All patients were treated with pencil-beam scanning. Eligibility criteria included age 18 years or older, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and breast cancer resected by mastectomy with or without immediate reconstruction with indications for PMRT. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either conventional fractionation or hypofractionation, with presence of immediate reconstruction (yes vs no) as a stratification factor, using a biased-coin minimisation algorithm. Any patient who received at least one fraction of protocol treatment was evaluable for the primary endpoint and safety analyses. The primary endpoint was 24-month complication rate from the date of first radiotherapy, defined as grade 3 or worse adverse events occurring from 90 days after last radiotherapy or unplanned surgical interventions in patients with immediate reconstruction. The inferiority of hypofractionation would not be ruled out if the upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference in 24-month complication rate between the two groups was greater than 10%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is closed to accrual. Results: Between June 2, 2016, and Aug 23, 2018, 88 patients were randomly assigned (44 to each group), of whom 82 received protocol treatment (41 in the conventional fractionation group and 41 in the hypofractionation group; median age of 52 years [IQR 44-64], 79 [96%] patients were White, two [2%] were Black or African American, one [1%] was Asian, and 79 [96%] were not of Hispanic ethnicity). As of data cutoff (Jan 30, 2023), the median follow-up was 39·3 months (IQR 37·5-61·2). The median mean heart dose was 0·54 Gy (IQR 0·30-0·72) for the conventional fractionation group and 0·49 Gy (0·25-0·64) for the hypofractionation group. Within 24 months of first radiotherapy, 14 protocol-defined complications occurred in six (15%) patients in the conventional fractionation group and in eight (20%) patients in the hypofractionation group (absolute difference 4·9% [one-sided 95% CI 18·5], p=0·27). The complications in the conventionally fractionated group were contracture (five [12%] of 41 patients]) and fat necrosis (one [2%] patient) requiring surgical intervention. All eight protocol-defined complications in the hypofractionation group were due to infections, three of which were acute infections that required surgical intervention, and five were late infections, four of which required surgical intervention. All 14 complications were in patients with immediate expander or implant-based reconstruction. Conclusion: After a median follow-up of 39·3 months, non-inferiority of the hypofractionation group could not be established. However, given similar tolerability, hypofractionated proton PMRT appears to be worthy of further study in patients with and without immediate reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Background: No randomized trials have compared hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) after breast-conserving surgery in the Asian population. This study aimed to determine whether a 3.5-week schedule of HFRT is noninferior to a standard 6-week schedule of CFRT in China. Methods: Patients from 4 Chinese institutions who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and had T1-2N0-3 invasive breast cancers participated this study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated central randomization schedule, without stratification, to receive whole-breast irradiation with or without nodal irradiation, followed by tumor-bed boost, either at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a boost of 10 Gy in five fractions over 1 week (CFRT) or 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks with a boost of 8.7 Gy in three daily fractions (HFRT). The primary endpoint was 5-year local recurrence (LR), and a 5% margin of 5-year LR was used to establish noninferiority. Results: Between August 2010 and November 2015, 734 patients were assigned to the HFRT (n = 368) or CFRT (n = 366) group. At a median follow-up of 73.5 months (interquartile range, 60.5-91.4 months), the 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 1.2% in the HFRT group and 2.0% in the CFRT group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.88;   = .017 for noninferiority). There were no significant differences in acute and late toxicities, except that the HFRT group had less grade 2-3 acute skin toxicity than the CFRT group (  = .019). Conclusion: CFRT and HFRT with a tumor-bed boost may have similar low LR and toxicity.",

This study was conducted to investigate whether pT1-2N1M0 breast cancer patients could benefit from PMRT based on RecurIndex assay. The clinical data of 213 pT1-2N1M0 breast cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. Through RecurIndex assay, 81 cases were assessed as the low risk, and 132 as the high risk. Compared to low-risk patients, high-risk patients especially those not receiving PMRT had a significantly increased risk of recurrence and metastasis, and worse 7-year local-regional recurrence-free interval (LRFI), distance recurrence-free interval (DRFI) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. PMRT-based subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between the low-risk patients with and without PMRT in 7-year LRFI, DRFI, RFS and overall survival (OS) rates, but apparent differences were all shown between the high-risk patients with and without PMRT in 7-year LRFI, DRFI, RFS and OS rates. Overall, for pT1-2N1M0 breast cancer patients at low risk of recurrence and metastasis stratified by RecurIndex assay, there may be a phenomenon of no PMRT benefits, while for those at high risk, use of PMRT may produce survival benefits.",

We compared sequential to concurrent combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with docetaxel chemotherapy in women with node-positive non-metastatic breast cancer. We report the final, 10-year analysis of disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and long-term safety. Methods: A total of 3298 women with HER2 nonamplified breast cancer were randomized to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by docetaxel (AC → T) every 3 weeks for four cycles or docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) every 3 weeks for six cycles. The patients received standard radiotherapy and endocrine therapy and were followed up for 10 years with annual clinical evaluation and mammography. Results: The 10-year DFS rates were 66.5% in the AC → T arm and 66.3% in the TAC arm (P = 0.749). OS was 79.9% in the AC → T arm and 78.9% in the TAC arm (P = 0.506). TAC was associated with higher rates of febrile neutropenia, although G-CSF primary prophylaxis greatly reduced this risk. AC → T was associated with a higher rate of myalgia, hand-foot syndrome, fluid retention, and sensory neuropathy. Conclusion: This 10-year analysis of the BCIRG-005 trial confirmed that the efficacy of TAC was not superior to AC → T in women with node-positive early breast cancer. The toxicity profiles differ between arms and were consistent with previous reports. The TAC regimen with G-CSF support provides shorter adjuvant treatment duration with less toxicity.",

T-DM1+P led to a lower pathologic complete response rate (44.4%   55.7%;   = .016), but fewer grade 3 or greater and serious adverse events (AEs). Here, we present 3-year outcomes from KRISTINE. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant T-DM1+P or TCH+P every 3 weeks for six cycles. Patients who received T-DM1+P continued adjuvant T-DM1+P, and patients who received TCH+P received adjuvant trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. Secondary end points included event-free survival (EFS), overall survival, patient-reported outcomes (measured from random assignment), and invasive disease-free survival (IDFS; measured from surgery). Results: Of patients, 444 were randomly assigned (T-DM1+P, n = 223; TCH+P, n = 221). Median follow-up was 37 months. Risk of an EFS event was higher with TDM-1+P (hazard ratio [HR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.36 to 4.98]) with more locoregional progression events before surgery (15 [6.7%]   0). Risk of an IDFS event after surgery was similar between arms (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.40]). Pathologic complete response was associated with a reduced risk of an IDFS event (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60]) regardless of treatment arm. Overall, grade 3 or greater AEs (31.8%   67.7%) were less common with T-DM1+P. During adjuvant treatment, grade 3 or greater AEs (24.5%   9.9%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (18.4%   3.8%) were more common with T-DM1+P. Patient-reported outcomes favored T-DM1+P during neoadjuvant treatment and were similar to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab during adjuvant treatment. Conclusion: Compared with TCH+P, T-DM1+P resulted in a higher risk of an EFS event owing to locoregional progression events before surgery, a similar risk of an IDFS event, fewer grade 3 or greater AEs during neoadjuvant treatment, and more AEs leading to treatment discontinuation during adjuvant treatment.",

In patients treated previously with anthracyclines and taxanes, capecitabine is an approved single-agent therapy. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), is also highly active in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer. We have conducted a phase II study to confirm activity and feasibility of capecitabine and trastuzumab in combination in HER-2-overexpressing advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes received oral capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) bid for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period combined with intravenous trastuzumab 4 mg/kg body weight on day 1 (loading dose) followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. Results: Capecitabine/trastuzumab treatment achieved objective responses in 12 patients (45%), including complete response in four patients (15%) and partial response in eight patients (30%). Disease was stabilized in an additional nine patients (33%). The median overall survival time was 28 months, and the median progression-free survival time was 6.7 months. The safety profile of the combination was favorable and predictable, with a low incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events. The most common adverse events were pain, hand-foot syndrome, and GI toxicities. Severe myelosuppression was rare and severe alopecia did not occur. Conclusion: These data confirm that the combination of capecitabine and trastuzumab is highly active in patients with HER-2-overexpressing anthracycline- and/or taxane-pretreated breast cancer, with only slight restrictions regarding quality of life.",

However, the optimal therapeutic paradigm after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitor remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib with switching ET versus chemotherapy after progression on prior palbociclib-based ET in Chinese patients with HR+/HER2- MBC. Methods: From 414 consecutive patients with HR+/HER2- MBC who had been treated with palbociclib plus ET from September 2018 to May 2022 in Peking University Cancer Hospital, we identified 80 patients who received abemaciclib plus switching ET or chemotherapy after progression on palbociclib, matched for age, original stage at diagnosis, disease-free interval, and tumor burden at 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazard model was performed to identify clinical factors associated with PFS in the abemaciclib group. Results: The median PFS was 6.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.94-8.06) in abemaciclib group and 4.0 months (95% CI, 2.52-5.49) in chemotherapy group (p = 0.667). And, there was no difference in median PFS between the sequential and nonsequential arm (6.0 vs. 6.0 months) in the abemaciclib group though fewer lines of prior systemic therapy and longer PFS from prior palbociclib in the sequential arm. However, patients with prior palbociclib as the first-line therapy had a significantly longer median PFS versus prior palbociclib as ≥2nd-line therapy (11.0 vs. 5.0 months, p = 0.043). Based on multivariable analysis, ER+/PR+ was an independent factor associated with longer PFS. There was no significant difference in overall survival between the abemaciclib and chemotherapy groups (p = 0.069). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that abemaciclib plus switching ET might be one of feasible treatment options for Chinese patients with HR+/HER2- MBC after progression on prior palbociclib-based therapy in addition to chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab trial was designed to address treatment of patients with small human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. The primary analysis of the Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab trial demonstrated a 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 98.7%. In this planned secondary analysis, we report longer-term outcomes and exploratory results to characterize the biology of small HER2-positive tumors and genetic factors that may predispose to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN). Methods: In this phase II study, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with tumors 3 cm or smaller and negative nodes received paclitaxel (80 mg/m ) with trastuzumab for 12 weeks, followed by trastuzumab for 9 months. The primary end point was DFS. Recurrence-free interval (RFI), breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were also analyzed. In an exploratory analysis, intrinsic subtyping by PAM50 (Prosigna) and calculation of the risk of recurrence score were performed on the nCounter analysis system on archival tissue. Genotyping was performed to investigate TIPN. Results: A total of 410 patients were enrolled from October 2007 to September 2010. After a median follow-up of 6.5 years, there were 23 DFS events. The 7-year DFS was 93% (95% CI, 90.4 to 96.2) with four (1.0%) distant recurrences, 7-year OS was 95% (95% CI, 92.4 to 97.7), and 7-year RFI was 97.5% (95% CI, 95.9 to 99.1). PAM50 analyses (n = 278) showed that most tumors were HER2-enriched (66%), followed by luminal B (14%), luminal A (13%), and basal-like (8%). Genotyping (n = 230) identified one single-nucleotide polymorphism,  , associated with an increased risk of TIPN in patients with grade 2 or greater TIPN (10.4%). Conclusion: With longer follow-up, adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab is associated with excellent long-term outcomes. Distribution of PAM50 intrinsic subtypes in small HER2-positive tumors is similar to that previously reported for larger tumors.",

        "abstract": "Background: 5-year results of the UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) trials suggested that lower total doses of radiotherapy delivered in fewer, larger doses (fractions) are at least as safe and effective as the historical standard regimen (50 Gy in 25 fractions) for women after primary surgery for early breast cancer. In this prespecified analysis, we report the 10-year follow-up of the START trials testing 13 fraction and 15 fraction regimens. Methods: From 1999 to 2002, women with completely excised invasive breast cancer (pT1-3a, pN0-1, M0) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment (where prescribed). Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre, type of primary surgery (breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy), and tumour bed boost radiotherapy. In START-A, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 41·6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. In START-B, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction. Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects. Analysis was by intention to treat. Follow-up data are still being collected. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Results: START-A enrolled 2236 women. Median follow-up was 9·3 years (IQR 8·0-10·0), after which 139 local-regional relapses had occurred. 10-year rates of local-regional relapse did not differ significantly between the 41·6 Gy and 50 Gy regimen groups (6·3%, 95% CI 4·7-8·5 vs 7·4%, 5·5-10·0; hazard ratio [HR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·59-1·38; p=0·65) or the 39 Gy (8·8%, 95% CI 6·7-11·4) and 50 Gy regimen groups (HR 1·18, 95% CI 0·79-1·76; p=0·41). In START-A, moderate or marked breast induration, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Normal tissue effects did not differ significantly between 41·6 Gy and 50 Gy groups. START-B enrolled 2215 women. Median follow-up was 9·9 years (IQR 7·5-10·1), after which 95 local-regional relapses had occurred. The proportion of patients with local-regional relapse at 10 years did not differ significantly between the 40 Gy group (4·3%, 95% CI 3·2-5·9) and the 50 Gy group (5·5%, 95% CI 4·2-7·2; HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·51-1·16; p=0·21). In START-B, breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 40 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Conclusion: Long-term follow-up confirms that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy is safe and effective for patients with early breast cancer. The results support the continued use of 40 Gy in 15 fractions, which has already been adopted by most UK centres as the standard of care for women requiring adjuvant radiotherapy for invasive early breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group MA.17 trial examined the efficacy of letrozole (LET) started within 3 months of 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer. When the trial was unblinded, patients who received placebo (PLAC) were offered LET. Methods: This cohort analysis describes the outcomes of women assigned PLAC at the initial random assignment after unblinding. Efficacy outcomes of women who chose LET (PLAC-LET group) were compared with those who did not (PLAC-PLAC group) by the hazard ratios and by P values calculated from Cox models that adjusted for imbalances between the groups. Toxicity analyses included only events that occurred after unblinding. Results: There were 1,579 women in the PLAC-LET group (median time from tamoxifen, 2.8 years) and 804 in the PLAC-PLAC group. Patients in the PLAC-LET group were younger; had a better performance status; and were more likely to have had node-positive disease, axillary dissection, and adjuvant chemotherapy than those in the PLAC-PLAC group. At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, disease-free survival (DFS; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.61; P < .0001) and distant DFS (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.74; P = .004) were superior in the PLAC-LET group. More self-reported new diagnoses of osteoporosis and significantly more clinical fractures occurred in the women who took LET (5.2% v 3.1%, P = .02). Conclusion: Interpretation of this cohort analysis suggests that LET improves DFS and distant DFS even when there has been a substantial period of time since the discontinuation of prior adjuvant tamoxifen.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to H (8 mg/kg loading; 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus T (75 mg/m(2) in HTX arm, 100 mg/m(2) in HT arm, every 3 weeks) with or without X (950 mg/m(2) twice per day on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Results In 222 patients, median follow-up was approximately 24 months. ORR was high with both regimens (70.5% with HTX; 72.7% with HT; P = .717); complete response rate was 23.2% with HTX compared with 16.4% with HT. HTX demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival: median 17.9 months compared with 12.8 months with HT (hazard ratio, 0.72; P = .045), which translates to a gain of around 5 months. Two-year survival probability was 75% with HTX compared with 66% with HT. Febrile neutropenia (27% v 15%) and grade 3/4 neutropenia (77% v 54%) incidences were higher with HT than HTX. Treatment-related grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (17% v < 1%) and grade 3/4 diarrhea (11% v 4%) occurred more commonly with HTX than HT. One case of congestive heart failure occurred in each arm. CONCLUSION HTX is an effective and feasible first-line therapy for HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, although it should be reserved for patients with good performance status who are not receiving long-term steroids.",

Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population. Methods: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs. The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review. Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints. Results: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age. The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials. Conclusion: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs. These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov  .",

Unfortunately, there is little data showing which ADCs should be chosen for those patients whose treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) failed. This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety between novel anti-HER2 ADCs and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for those with TKIs failure. Methods: HER2-positive MBC using ADCs from January 2013 to June 2022 were included, and all of them were treated with TKIs. The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary study endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety. Results: A total of 144 patients with 73 patients in the novel anti-HER2 ADCs group and 71 patients in the T-DM1 group. In these novel ADCs, 30 patients received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd), 43 patients receive other novel ADCs. The median PFS in the novel ADCs group and T-DM1 group were 7.0 months versus 4.0 months, respectively, and ORR was 54.8% versus 22.5%, CBR was 65.8% versus 47.9%, respectively. In subgroups analysis, the PFS were both significantly improved in patients receiving T-Dxd and other novel ADCs compared with T-DM1. The most common grades 3-4 adverse events in the novel anti-HER-2 ADCs group were neutropenia (20.5%) and thrombocytopenia (28.1%) in the T-DM1 group. Conclusion: In patients with HER2-positive MBC previously treated with TKIs, both T-Dxd and other novel anti-HER2 ADCs yielded statistically significant better PFS than T-DM1 did, with tolerable toxicities.",

Here we present a new landmark in survival follow-up for a phase III cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitor clinical trial in patients with ABC (median, 56.3 months). Methods: This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 174 sites (30 countries). Patients were men and postmenopausal women (age ≥18 years) with histologically/cytologically confirmed HR+/HER2- ABC. Patients could have received ≤1 line of endocrine therapy (ET) but no chemotherapy for ABC. Patients, assigned 2:1, were stratified by the presence/absence of liver/lung metastases and previous ET. Patients received intramuscular fulvestrant (500 mg, day 1 of each 28-day cycle plus day 15 of cycle 1) with oral ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3 weeks on, 1 week off) or placebo. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in patients receiving ≥1 dose study treatment. OS was a secondary endpoint.

We conducted the prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 TUXEDO-1 trial. We enrolled patients aged ≥18 years with HER2-positive breast cancer and newly diagnosed untreated brain metastases or brain metastases progressing after previous local therapy, previous exposure to trastuzumab and pertuzumab and no indication for immediate local therapy. Patients received trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously at the standard dose of 5.4 mg per kg bodyweight once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was intracranial response rate measured according to the response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases criteria. A Simon two-stage design was used to compare a null hypothesis of <26% response rate against an alternative of 61%. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the intention-to-treat population of patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Two patients (13.3%) had a complete intracranial response, nine (60%) had a partial intracranial response and three (20%) had stable disease as the best intracranial response, with a best overall intracranial response rate of 73.3% (95% confidential interval 48.1-89.1%), thus meeting the predefined primary outcome. No new safety signals were observed and global quality-of-life and cognitive functioning were maintained over the treatment duration. In the TUXEDO-1 trial ( , EudraCT 2020-000981-41), trastuzumab deruxtecan showed a high intracranial response rate in patients with active brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer and should be considered as a treatment option in this setting.",

Methods: This phase III open-label, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre clinical trial enrolled patients with locally recurrent or MBC who had had 2-5 prior chemotherapy regimens, including an anthracycline and taxane) from September 26, 2013, to May 19, 2015. Women were randomised 1:1 to receive eribulin (1.4 mg/m , intravenously, on day 1 and day 8) or vinorelbine (25 mg/m , intravenously, on day 1, day 8 and day 15) every 21 days. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response and overall survival (OS). Results: Five hundred thirty women were randomised to receive eribulin (n = 264) or vinorelbine (n = 266). Improvement in PFS was observed with eribulin compared with vinorelbine (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.98, P = 0.036); median PFS was 2.8 months in both treatment arms. The median OS was 13.4 months with eribulin and 12.5 months with vinorelbine (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.80-1.31, P = 0.838). The ORR was 30.7% (95% CI: 25.2%-36.6%) with eribulin and 16.9% (95% CI: 12.6%-22.0%) with vinorelbine (P < 0.001). Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were less frequent with eribulin (7.2%) than with vinorelbine (14.0%). Conclusion: Eribulin achieved statistically significantly superior PFS (and response rate) compared with vinorelbine in previously treated women with locally recurrent or MBC.

To address this issue, we began the DATA study to assess different durations of anastrozole therapy after tamoxifen. Methods: DATA was a prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 study done in 79 hospitals in the Netherlands. We randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer with no signs of disease recurrence after 2-3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen to either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole treatment (1 mg orally once a day) in a 1:1 ratio. We used TENALEA (Trans European Network for Clinical Trials Services) for the randomisation procedure. Stratification factors were nodal status, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and tamoxifen treatment duration. The primary study endpoint of this analysis was disease-free survival starting beyond 3 years after randomisation (adapted disease-free survival). Here we report the final analysis from the DATA trial, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  . Results: Between June 28, 2006, and Aug 10, 2009, we screened 1912 patients of whom 955 were assigned to the 3-year group and 957 to the 6-year anastrozole treatment group. 1860 patients were eligible (931 in the 6-year group and 929 in the 3-year group) and 1660 were disease free 3 years after randomisation. The 5-year adapted disease-free survival was 83·1% (95% CI 80·0-86·3) in the 6-year group and 79·4% (76·1-82·8) in the 3-year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·62-1·02]; p=0·066). Patients in the 6-year treatment group had more adverse events than those in the 3-year treatment group, including all-grade arthralgia or myalgia (478 [58%] of 827 in the 6-year treatment group vs 438 [53%] of 833 in the 3-year treatment group) and osteopenia or osteoporosis (173 [21%] vs 137 [16%]). Conclusion: We cannot recommend the use of extended adjuvant aromatase inhibition after 5 years of sequential endocrine therapy in all postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Short course regimen has become the major trend in the field of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with breast cancer. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HF-RT) regimen of 40-42.5 Gy in 15-16 fractions has been established as a preferred option for whole breast irradiation. However, few evidences of hypofractionated regional nodal irradiation (RNI), especially involving internal mammary nodes (IMNs), could be available during the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Against this background, we design this trial to explore the hypothesis that HF-RT regimen involving RNI (including infraclavicular, supraclavicular nodes and IMNs) will be non-inferior to a standard schedule by using IMRT technique. Methods: This is an open-label randomised, non-inferior, multicentre phase III trial. Patients with breast cancer with an indication for RNI after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy are randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into the following two groups: hypofractionated regimen of 2.67 Gy for 16 fractions or conventional regimen of 2 Gy for 25 fractions. The dose was prescribed to ipsilateral chest wall or whole breast and RNI (including infraclavicular, supraclavicular nodes and IMNs, lower axilla if indicated). The trial plans to enrol a total of 801 patients and all patients will be treated using IMRT technique. The primary endpoint is 5-year locoregional recurrence. The secondary endpoints include 5-year distant metastasis free survival, invasive recurrence-free survival, overall survival, accumulative acute radiation-induced toxicity and accumulative late radiation-induced toxicity, cosmetic outcomes and quality of life. Results: The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (version 2018-95-3) and approvals from ethical committee of each participating centre have also been obtained. Research findings will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Conclusion: .",

Patients (female; n = 329; randomized 2:1) received neoadjuvant pertuzumab/placebo with trastuzumab and docetaxel, followed by adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, then pertuzumab/placebo with trastuzumab until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, for up to 1 year. Five-year event-free survival estimates are 84.8% with pertuzumab and 73.7% with placebo (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.89); 5-year disease-free survival rates are 86.0% and 75.0%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.88). Safety data are consistent with the known pertuzumab safety profile and generally comparable between arms, except for diarrhea. Limitations include the lack of ado-trastuzumab emtansine as an option for patients with residual disease and the descriptive nature of the secondary, long-term efficacy endpoints.

After a median follow-up of 9 years, exemestane + OFS significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), but not overall survival, compared with tamoxifen + OFS. We now report DFS, DRFI, and overall survival after a median follow-up of 13 years. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the 12-year DFS (4.6% absolute improvement, hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.90;   < .001) and DRFI (1.8% absolute improvement, HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.98;   = .03), but not overall survival (90.1%   89.1%, HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.11), continued to be significantly improved for patients assigned exemestane + OFS over tamoxifen + OFS. Among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors (86.0% of the ITT population), the absolute improvement in 12-year overall survival with exemestane + OFS was 2.0% (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04) and 3.3% in those who received chemotherapy (45.9% of the ITT population). Overall survival benefit was clinically significant in high-risk patients, eg, women age < 35 years (4.0%) and those with > 2 cm (4.5%) or grade 3 tumors (5.5%). These sustained reductions of the risk of recurrence with adjuvant exemestane + OFS, compared with tamoxifen + OFS, provide guidance for selecting patients for whom exemestane should be preferred over tamoxifen in the setting of OFS.[Media: see text].",

We investigated the activity and safety of pyrotinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases. Methods: We did a multicentre, single-arm, two-cohort, phase 2 trial in eight tertiary hospitals in China. Patients aged 18 years or older who had radiotherapy-naive HER2-positive brain metastases (cohort A) or progressive disease after radiotherapy (cohort B), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, received pyrotinib 400 mg orally once daily, and capecitabine 1000 mg/m  orally twice daily for 14 days, followed by 7 days off every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was confirmed intracranial objective response rate by investigator assessment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (version 1.1). Activity and safety were analysed in patients with at least one dose of study drug. The study is ongoing, but recruitment is complete. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between Jan 29, 2019, and July 10, 2020, we enrolled 78 women: 51 (86%) of 59 patients in cohort A and 18 (95%) of 19 patients in cohort B had previous exposure to trastuzumab. Median follow-up duration was 15·7 months (IQR 9·7-19·0). The intracranial objective response rate was 74·6% (95% CI 61·6-85·0; 44 of 59 patients) in cohort A and 42·1% (20·3-66·5; eight of 19 patients) in cohort B. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhoea (14 [24%] in cohort A and four [21%] in cohort B). Two (3%) patients in cohort A and three (16%) in cohort B had treatment-related serious adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred.

        "abstract": "Background: The 70-gene signature test (MammaPrint) has been shown to improve prediction of clinical outcome in women with early-stage breast cancer. We sought to provide prospective evidence of the clinical utility of the addition of the 70-gene signature to standard clinical-pathological criteria in selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: In this randomized, phase 3 study, we enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer and determined their genomic risk (using the 70-gene signature) and their clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online). Women at low clinical and genomic risk did not receive chemotherapy, whereas those at high clinical and genomic risk did receive such therapy. In patients with discordant risk results, either the genomic risk or the clinical risk was used to determine the use of chemotherapy. The primary goal was to assess whether, among patients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression profile who did not receive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastasis would be 92% (i.e., the noninferiority boundary) or higher. Results: A total of 1550 patients (23.2%) were deemed to be at high clinical risk and low genomic risk. At 5 years, the rate of survival without distant metastasis in this group was 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 92.5 to 96.2) among those not receiving chemotherapy. The absolute difference in this survival rate between these patients and those who received chemotherapy was 1.5 percentage points, with the rate being lower without chemotherapy. Similar rates of survival without distant metastasis were reported in the subgroup of patients who had estrogen-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and either node-negative or node-positive disease. Conclusion: Among women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings, approximately 46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might not require chemotherapy.",

Methods: This randomized, double-blind, phase III study was conducted between 9 December 2016 and 29 March 2019. Postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative ABC with no prior systemic therapy in an advanced setting (cohort A) or progression on prior ET (cohort B) received abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) or placebo plus: anastrozole (1 mg/day) or letrozole (2.5 mg/day) (cohort A) or fulvestrant (500 mg per label) (cohort B). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in cohort A, analyzed using the stratified log-rank test. Secondary endpoints were PFS in cohort B (key secondary endpoint), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. This interim analysis was planned after 119 PFS events in cohort A. Results: In cohort A, 207 patients were randomly assigned to the abemaciclib arm and 99 to the placebo arm.

        "abstract": "Background: Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6i) are widely used as first-line therapy for hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (HR+ MBC). Although abemaciclib monotherapy is also FDA-approved for treatment of disease progression on endocrine therapy, there is limited insight into the clinical activity of abemaciclib after progression on prior CDK4/6i. Methods: We identified patients with HR+ MBC from 6 cancer centers in the United States who received abemaciclib after disease progression on prior CDK4/6i, and abstracted clinical features, outcomes, toxicity, and predictive biomarkers. Results: In the multicenter cohort, abemaciclib was well tolerated after a prior course of CDK4/6i (palbociclib)-based therapy; a minority of patients discontinued abemaciclib because of toxicity without progression (9.2%). After progression on palbociclib, most patients (71.3%) received nonsequential therapy with abemaciclib (with ≥1 intervening non-CDK4/6i regimens), with most receiving abemaciclib with an antiestrogen agent (fulvestrant, 47.1%; aromatase inhibitor, 27.6%), and the remainder receiving abemaciclib monotherapy (19.5%). Median progression-free survival for abemaciclib in this population was 5.3 months and median overall survival was 17.2 months, notably similar to results obtained in the MONARCH-1 study of abemaciclib monotherapy in heavily pretreated HR+/HER2-negative CDK4/6i-naïve patients. A total of 36.8% of patients received abemaciclib for ≥6 months. There was no relationship between the duration of clinical benefit while on palbociclib and the subsequent duration of treatment with abemaciclib. RB1, ERBB2, and CCNE1 alterations were noted among patients with rapid progression on abemaciclib. Conclusion: A subset of patients with HR+ MBC continue to derive clinical benefit from abemaciclib after progression on prior palbociclib. These results highlight the need for future studies to confirm molecular predictors of cross-resistance to CDK4/6i therapy and to better characterize the utility of abemaciclib after disease progression on prior CDK4/6i.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, breast cancer affected more Chinese women than any other cancer in 2020. The brain is an increasingly common metastatic sites of breast cancer. Although the risk of developing brain metastases (BMs) is lower in breast cancer than in lung cancer and melanoma, due to its high prevalence, it is the second most common cause of BM among solid tumors, being second only to lung cancer. The incidence of breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) differs by molecular subtype. Half of patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive and one-third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) develop BM. The clinical manifestations of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) are often non-specific and may manifest as a variety of signs and symptoms, mainly including brain parenchyma involvement and meningeal irritation syndromes cranial nerve involvement, increased intracranial pressure, and progressive brain dysfunction. Therefore, the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) Breast Cancer Committee has developed this expert consensus on BM, in an effort to improve the overall prognosis of BCBM and promote the standardized diagnosis and treatment of this disease. During the development of this expert consensus, we carried out a comprehensive literature review and referred to some of the most authoritative guidelines in China and abroad. In this consensus, we will discuss clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, pathological diagnosis, treatments, prognosis, follow-up and monitoring. We hope this consensus will be of help to all the clinicians majored in breast cancer and other similar professions.",

Methods: We did this retrospective, multicentre, cohort study at 97 cancer centres in China. EBC patients who received treatment regardless of preoperative therapy, surgery or postoperative therapy during first quarter of 2020 were included. Results: 8397 patients were eligible with a median age of 50 (IQR 43-56). 0·2% (15/8397) of EBC patients were confirmed as COVID-19 infection. Only 5·2% of breast cancer diagnosis occurred after quarantine in Hubei compared with 15·3% in other provinces (OR= 0·30, 95%CI 0·24-0·38). postoperative endocrine therapy were least affected compared with different regions after quarantine (OR=0·37 [95%CI 0·19-0·73]).

        "abstract": "Background: We are building a clinical decision support system (CSCO AI) for breast cancer patients to improve the efficiency of clinical decision-making. We aimed to assess cancer treatment regimens given by CSCO AI and different levels of clinicians. Methods: 400 breast cancer patients were screened from the CSCO database. Clinicians with similar levels were randomly assigned one of the volumes (200 cases). CSCO AI was asked to assess all cases. Three reviewers were independently asked to evaluate the regimens from clinicians and CSCO AI. Regimens were masked before evaluation. The primary outcome was the proportion of high-level conformity (HLC). Results: The overall concordance between clinicians and CSCO AI was 73.9% (3621/4900). It was 78.8% (2757/3500) in the early-stage, higher than that in the metastatic stage (61.7% [864/1400], p < 0.001). The concordance was 90.7% (635/700) and 56.4% (395/700) in adjuvant radiotherapy and second-line therapy respectively. HLC in CSCO AI was 95.8% (95%CI:94.0%-97.6%), significantly higher than that in clinicians (90.8%, 95%CI:89.8%-91.8%). Considering professions, the HLC of surgeons was 85.9%, lower than that of CSCO AI (OR = 0.25,95%CI: 0.16-0.41). The most significant difference in HLC was in first-line therapy (OR = 0.06, 95%CI:0.01-0.41). When clinicians were divided according to their levels, there was no statistical significance between CSCO AI and higher level clinicians. Conclusion: Decision from CSCO AI for breast cancer was superior than most clinicians did except in second-line therapy. The improvements in process outcomes suggest that CSCO AI can be widely used in clinical practice.",

Methods: A multidisciplinary consensus panel used a meta-analysis of margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) from a systematic review of 33 studies including 28,162 patients as the primary evidence base for consensus. Results: Positive margins (ink on invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ) are associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of IBTR compared with negative margins. This increased risk is not mitigated by favorable biology, endocrine therapy, or a radiation boost. More widely clear margins do not significantly decrease the rate of IBTR compared with no ink on tumor. There is no evidence that more widely clear margins reduce IBTR for young patients or for those with unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intraductal component. Conclusion: The use of no ink on tumor as the standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer in the era of multidisciplinary therapy is associated with low rates of IBTR and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcomes, and decrease health care costs.

        "abstract": "Background: The Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline on surgical margins for breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation in stage I and II invasive breast cancer was considered for endorsement. Methods: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has a policy and set of procedures for endorsing practice guidelines developed by other organizations. ASCO staff reviewed the SSO/ASTRO guideline for developmental rigor; an ASCO ad hoc review panel of experts reviewed the guideline content. Results: The ASCO ad hoc guideline review panel concurred that the recommendations are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence in this content area and that they present options acceptable to patients. According to the SSO/ASTRO guideline, the use of no ink on tumor (ie, no cancer cells adjacent to any inked edge/surface of specimen) as the standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer in the era of multidisciplinary therapy is associated with low rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcomes, and decrease health care costs. Conclusion: The ASCO review panel endorses the SSO/ASTRO recommendations with qualifications, as follows. The panel reinforces and amplifies the guideline authors' call for the monitoring of outcomes of the guideline at the institutional level, as institutions transition to adopting the SSO/ASTRO recommendations; would place greater emphasis on the importance of postlumpectomy mammography for cases involving microcalcifications; and calls for flexibility in the application of the guideline in light of the generally weak evidence supporting the recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Background: Morphological assessment of the degree of differentiation has been shown in numerous studies to provide useful prognostic information in breast cancer, but until recently histological grading has not been accepted as a routine procedure, mainly because of perceived problems with reproducibility and consistency. In the Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Study the most commonly used method, described by Bloom & Richardson, has been modified in order to make the criteria more objective. The revised technique involves semiquantitative evaluation of three morphological features--the percentage of tubule formation, the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and an accurate mitotic count using a defined field area. A numerical scoring system is used and the overall grade is derived from a summation of individual scores for the three variables: three grades of differentiation are used. Since 1973, over 2200 patients with primary operable breast cancer have been entered into a study of multiple prognostic factors. Histological grade, assessed in 1831 patients, shows a very strong correlation with prognosis; patients with grade I tumours have a significantly better survival than those with grade II and III tumours (P less than 0.0001). These results demonstrate that this method for histological grading provides important prognostic information and, if the grading protocol is followed consistently, reproducible results can be obtained. Histological grade forms part of the multifactorial Nottingham prognostic index, together with tumour size and lymph node stage, which is used to stratify individual patients for appropriate therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The interobserver reproducibility of the Nottingham modification of the Bloom and Richardson histologic grading scheme for invasive breast carcinoma was tested. Six surgical pathologists from four institutions independently evaluated histologic grade and each of its three components for 75 infiltrating ductal carcinomas. The number of slides per case ranged from one to nine (median 3). Pairwise kappa values for agreement ranged from moderate to substantial (0.43-0.74) for histologic grade. Generalized kappa values indicated substantial agreement for tubule formation (0.64), moderate agreement for mitotic count (0.52), and near moderate agreement for nuclear pleomorphism (0.40). Normalizing the mitotic counts per mm2 showed only slight improvement in agreement over the published range of mitotic counts for three different field areas. The results suggest that steps to discriminate between categories for nuclear pleomorphism would likely be of benefit for improving the interobserver reproducibility of histologic grade. Nevertheless, the Nottingham modification of the Bloom and Richardson grading system is recommended as a suitable scheme for evaluating invasive breast carcinomas in the routine clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: The 13th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2013) Expert Panel reviewed and endorsed substantial new evidence on aspects of the local and regional therapies for early breast cancer, supporting less extensive surgery to the axilla and shorter durations of radiation therapy. It refined its earlier approach to the classification and management of luminal disease in the absence of amplification or overexpression of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene, while retaining essentially unchanged recommendations for the systemic adjuvant therapy of HER2-positive and 'triple-negative' disease. The Panel again accepted that conventional clinico-pathological factors provided a surrogate subtype classification, while noting that in those areas of the world where multi-gene molecular assays are readily available many clinicians prefer to base chemotherapy decisions for patients with luminal disease on these genomic results rather than the surrogate subtype definitions. Several multi-gene molecular assays were recognized as providing accurate and reproducible prognostic information, and in some cases prediction of response to chemotherapy. Cost and availability preclude their application in many environments at the present time. Broad treatment recommendations are presented. Such recommendations do not imply that each Panel member agrees: indeed, among more than 100 questions, only one (trastuzumab duration) commanded 100% agreement. The various recommendations in fact carried differing degrees of support, as reflected in the nuanced wording of the text below and in the votes recorded in supplementary Appendix S1, available at Annals of Oncology online. Detailed decisions on treatment will as always involve clinical consideration of disease extent, host factors, patient preferences and social and economic constraints.",

        "abstract": "Background: Bisphosphonates have profound effects on bone physiology, and could modify the process of metastasis. We undertook collaborative meta-analyses to clarify the risks and benefits of adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment in breast cancer. Methods: We sought individual patient data from all unconfounded trials in early breast cancer that randomised between bisphosphonate and control. Primary outcomes were recurrence, distant recurrence, and breast cancer mortality. Primary subgroup investigations were site of first distant recurrence (bone or other), menopausal status (postmenopausal [combining natural and artificial] or not), and bisphosphonate class (aminobisphosphonate [eg, zoledronic acid, ibandronate, pamidronate] or other [ie, clodronate]). Intention-to-treat log-rank methods yielded bisphosphonate versus control first-event rate ratios (RRs). Results: We received data on 18,766 women (18,206 [97%] in trials of 2-5 years of bisphosphonate) with median follow-up 5·6 woman-years, 3453 first recurrences, and 2106 subsequent deaths. Overall, the reductions in recurrence (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·87-1·01; 2p=0·08), distant recurrence (0·92, 0·85-0·99; 2p=0·03), and breast cancer mortality (0·91, 0·83-0·99; 2p=0·04) were of only borderline significance, but the reduction in bone recurrence was more definite (0·83, 0·73-0·94; 2p=0·004). Among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11 767 postmenopausal women it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·78-0·94; 2p=0·002), distant recurrence (0·82, 0·74-0·92; 2p=0·0003), bone recurrence (0·72, 0·60-0·86; 2p=0·0002), and breast cancer mortality (0·82, 0·73-0·93; 2p=0·002). Even for bone recurrence, however, the heterogeneity of benefit was barely significant by menopausal status (2p=0·06 for trend with menopausal status) or age (2p=0·03), and it was non-significant by bisphosphonate class, treatment schedule, oestrogen receptor status, nodes, tumour grade, or concomitant chemotherapy. No differences were seen in non-breast cancer mortality. Bone fractures were reduced (RR 0·85, 95% CI 0·75-0·97; 2p=0·02). Conclusion: Adjuvant bisphosphonates reduce the rate of breast cancer recurrence in the bone and improve breast cancer survival, but there is definite benefit only in women who were postmenopausal when treatment began.",

        "abstract": "Background: To update key recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer guideline. Methods: Based on the signals approach, an Expert Panel reviewed published literature and research survey results on the observed frequency of less common in situ hybridization (ISH) patterns to update the recommendations. Results: Two recommendations addressed via correspondence in 2015 are included. First, immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ is defined as invasive breast cancer with weak to moderate complete membrane staining observed in >10% of tumor cells. Second, if the initial HER2 test result in a core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test may (not \"must\") be ordered on the excision specimen based on specific clinical criteria. The HER2 testing algorithm for breast cancer is updated to address the recommended workup for less common clinical scenarios (approximately 5% of cases) observed when using a dual-probe ISH assay. These scenarios are described as ISH group 2 ( HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 [CEP17] ratio ≥2.0; average HER2 copy number <4.0 signals per cell), ISH group 3 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals per cell), and ISH group 4 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥4.0 and <6.0 signals per cell). The diagnostic approach includes more rigorous interpretation criteria for ISH and requires concomitant IHC review for dual-probe ISH groups 2 to 4 to arrive at the most accurate HER2 status designation (positive or negative) based on combined interpretation of the ISH and IHC assays. The Expert Panel recommends that laboratories using single-probe ISH assays include concomitant IHC review as part of the interpretation of all single-probe ISH assay results.",

Methods: ASCO/CAP convened an Update Committee that included coauthors of the 2007 guideline to conduct a systematic literature review and update recommendations for optimal HER2 testing. Results: The Update Committee identified criteria and areas requiring clarification to improve the accuracy of HER2 testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH). The guideline was reviewed and approved by both organizations. Conclusion: The Update Committee recommends that HER2 status (HER2 negative or positive) be determined in all patients with invasive (early stage or recurrence) breast cancer on the basis of one or more HER2 test results (negative, equivocal, or positive). Testing criteria define HER2-positive status when (on observing within an area of tumor that amounts to > 10% of contiguous and homogeneous tumor cells) there is evidence of protein overexpression (IHC) or gene amplification (HER2 copy number or HER2/CEP17 ratio by ISH based on counting at least 20 cells within the area). If results are equivocal (revised criteria), reflex testing should be performed using an alternative assay (IHC or ISH). Repeat testing should be considered if results seem discordant with other histopathologic findings. Laboratories should demonstrate high concordance with a validated HER2 test on a sufficiently large and representative set of specimens. Testing must be performed in a laboratory accredited by CAP or another accrediting entity. The Update Committee urges providers and health systems to cooperate to ensure the highest quality testing. This guideline was developed through a collaboration between the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both Journal of Clinical Oncology and the Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine.",

        "abstract": "Background: Molecular subtyping of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) via gene expression profiling is essential for understanding the molecular essence of this heterogeneous disease and for guiding individualized treatment. We aim to devise a clinically practical method based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the molecular subtyping of TNBCs. Methods: By analyzing the RNA sequencing data on TNBCs from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) (n = 360) and The Cancer Genome Atlas data set (n = 158), we determined markers that can identify specific molecular subtypes. We performed immunohistochemical staining on tumor sections of 210 TNBCs from FUSCC, established an IHC-based classifier, and applied it to another two cohorts (n = 183 and 214). Results: We selected androgen receptor (AR), CD8, FOXC1, and DCLK1 as immunohistochemical markers and classified TNBCs into five subtypes based on the staining results: (a) IHC-based luminal androgen receptor (IHC-LAR; AR-positive [+]), (b) IHC-based immunomodulatory (IHC-IM; AR-negative [-], CD8+), (c) IHC-based basal-like immune-suppressed (IHC-BLIS; AR-, CD8-, FOXC1+), (d) IHC-based mesenchymal (IHC-MES; AR-, CD8-, FOXC1-, DCLK1+), and (e) IHC-based unclassifiable (AR-, CD8-, FOXC1-, DCLK1-). The κ statistic indicated substantial agreement between the IHC-based classification and mRNA-based classification. Multivariate survival analysis suggested that our IHC-based classification was an independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival. Transcriptomic data and pathological observations implied potential treatment strategies for different subtypes. The IHC-LAR subtype showed relative activation of HER2 pathway. The IHC-IM subtype tended to exhibit an immune-inflamed phenotype characterized by the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor parenchyma. The IHC-BLIS subtype showed high expression of a VEGF signature. The IHC-MES subtype displayed activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Conclusion: We developed an IHC-based approach to classify TNBCs into molecular subtypes. This IHC-based classification can provide additional information for prognostic evaluation. It allows for subgrouping of TNBC patients in clinical trials and evaluating the efficacy of targeted therapies within certain subtypes.",

        "abstract": "Background: In breast cancer patients, sentinel lymph node biopsy is carried out at the same time as the removal of the primary tumour to postoperatively test with histopathology for regional metastases in the sentinel lymph node. Those patients with positive test results are then operated on 2-4 weeks after primary surgery to remove the lymph nodes from the axilla (axillary lymph node dissection, ALND). New molecular tests RD-100i [one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA); based on messenger RNA amplification to identify the cytokeratin-19 (CK19) gene marker] (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) and Metasin (using the CK19 and mammaglobin gene markers) (Cellular Pathology, Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, Harlow, UK) are intended to provide an intraoperative diagnosis, thereby avoiding the need for postoperative histopathology and, in positive cases, a second operation for ALND. Methods: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using OSNA and Metasin in the NHS in England for the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes metastases, compared with postoperative histopathology, the current standard. Results: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Health Economic Evaluations Database as well as clinical trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings were searched up to July 2012. Conclusion: A systematic review of the evidence was carried out using standard methods. Single-gate studies were used to estimate the accuracy of OSNA with histopathology as the reference standard. The cost-effectiveness analysis adapted an existing simulation model of the long-term costs and health implications of early breast cancer diagnostic outcomes. The model accounted for the costs of an extended first operation with intraoperative testing, the loss of health-related quality of life (disutility) from waiting for postoperative test results, disutility and costs of a second operation, and long-term costs and disutility from lymphoedema related to ALND, adjuvant therapy, locoregional recurrence and metastatic recurrence.",

Mutations in p53 and Hippo signaling pathways are more prevalent, and 2 mutually exclusive and 9 co-occurring patterns exist among 9 oncogenic pathways in our cohort. Further preclinical investigation partially suggests that NF2 loss-of-function mutations can be sensitive to a Hippo-targeted strategy.

Methods: ASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018. Guideline recommendations were based on the Panel's review of the evidence from six trials. Results: The six included studies of AI treatment beyond 5 years of therapy demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo. Bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment. Conclusion: The Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk of reduction were modest and that, for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration that is based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for decisions about extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, including discussions about the absolute benefits in the reduction of breast cancer recurrence, the prevention of second breast cancers, and the impact of adverse effects of treatment.

        "abstract": "Background: To measure residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in order to improve the prognostic information that can be obtained from evaluating pathologic response. Methods: Pathologic slides and reports were reviewed from 382 patients in two different treatment cohorts: sequential paclitaxel (T) then fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) in 241 patients; and a single regimen of FAC in 141 patients. Residual cancer burden (RCB) was calculated as a continuous index combining pathologic measurements of primary tumor (size and cellularity) and nodal metastases (number and size) for prediction of distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) in multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results: RCB was independently prognostic in a multivariate model that included age, pretreatment clinical stage, hormone receptor status, hormone therapy, and pathologic response (pathologic complete response [pCR] v residual disease [RD]; hazard ratio = 2.50; 95% CI 1.70 to 3.69; P < .001). Minimal RD (RCB-I) in 17% of patients carried the same prognosis as pCR (RCB-0). Extensive RD (RCB-III) in 13% of patients was associated with poor prognosis, regardless of hormone receptor status, adjuvant hormone therapy, or pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of residual disease. The generalizability of RCB for prognosis of distant relapse was confirmed in the FAC-treated validation cohort. Conclusion: RCB determined from routine pathologic materials represented the distribution of RD, was a significant predictor of DRFS, and can be used to define categories of near-complete response and chemotherapy resistance.",

        "abstract": "Background: The 12th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2011) Expert Panel adopted a new approach to the classification of patients for therapeutic purposes based on the recognition of intrinsic biological subtypes within the breast cancer spectrum. For practical purposes, these subtypes may be approximated using clinicopathological rather than gene expression array criteria. In general, systemic therapy recommendations follow the subtype classification. Thus, 'Luminal A' disease generally requires only endocrine therapy, which also forms part of the treatment of the 'Luminal B' subtype. Chemotherapy is considered indicated for most patients with 'Luminal B', 'Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive', and 'Triple negative (ductal)' disease, with the addition of trastuzumab in 'HER2 positive' disease. Progress was also noted in defining better tolerated local therapies in selected cases without loss of efficacy, such as accelerated radiation therapy and the omission of axillary dissection under defined circumstances. Broad treatment recommendations are presented, recognizing that detailed treatment decisions need to consider disease extent, host factors, patient preferences, and social and economic constraints.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the neoadjuvant GeparSixto study, adding carboplatin to taxane- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we present survival data and the potential prognostic and predictive role of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Methods: Patients were randomized to paclitaxel plus nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet®) (PM) or PM plus carboplatin (PMCb). The secondary study end points disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Median follow-up was 47.3 months. HRD was among the exploratory analyses in GeparSixto and was successfully measured in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 193/315 (61.3%) participants with TNBC. Homologous recombination (HR) deficiency was defined as HRD score ≥42 and/or presence of tumor BRCA mutations (tmBRCA). Results: A significantly better DFS (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.93; P = 0.022) was observed in patients with TNBC when treated with PMCb. The improvement of OS with PMCb was not statistically significant. Additional carboplatin did not improve DFS or OS in patients with HER2-positive tumors. HR deficiency was detected in 136 (70.5%) of 193 triple-negative tumors, of which 82 (60.3%) showed high HRD score without tmBRCA. HR deficiency independently predicted pCR (ypT0 ypN0) [odds ratio (OR) 2.60, 95% CI 1.26-5.37, P = 0.008]. Adding carboplatin to PM significantly increased the pCR rate from 33.9% to 63.5% in HR deficient tumors (P = 0.001), but only marginally in HR nondeficient tumors (from 20.0% to 29.6%, P = 0.540; test for interaction P = 0.327). pCR rates with carboplatin were also higher (63.2%) than without carboplatin (31.7%; OR 3.69, 1.46-9.37, P = 0.005) in patients with high HRD score but no tmBRCA. DFS rates were improved with addition of carboplatin, both in HR nondeficient (hazard ratio 0.44, 0.17-1.17, P = 0.086) and HR deficient tumors (hazard ratio 0.49, 0.23-1.04, P = 0.059). Conclusion: The addition of carboplatin to neoadjuvant PM improved DFS significantly in TNBC. Long-term survival analyses support the neoadjuvant use of carboplatin in TNBC. HR deficiency in TNBC and HRD score in non-tmBRCA TNBC are predictors of response. HRD does not predict for carboplatin benefit.",

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) was superior to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) in a trial in early breast cancer. However, activity of TC relative to AC regimens with a taxane (TaxAC) is unknown. Methods In a series of three adjuvant trials, women were randomly assigned to TC for six cycles (TC6) or to a standard TaxAC regimen. US Oncology Research (USOR) 06-090 compared TC6 with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC6). National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-46-I/USOR 07132 compared TC6, TAC6, or TC6 plus bevacizumab. NSABP B-49 compared TC6 with several standard AC and taxane combination regimens. Before any analysis of individual trials, a joint efficacy analysis of TC versus the TaxAC regimens was planned, with invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) as the primary end point. Patients who received TC6 plus bevacizumab on NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132 were not included. A hazard ratio (HR) from a stratified Cox model that exceeded 1.18 for TC6 versus TaxAC was predefined as inferiority for TC6. The prespecified interim monitoring plan was to report for futility if the HR was > 1.18 when 334 IDFS events were observed (50% of 668 events required for definitive analysis). Results A total of 2,125 patients were randomly assigned to receive TC6 regimens and 2,117 patients were randomly assigned to receive TaxAC regimens. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years. There were 334 IDFS events, and the HR for TC6 versus TaxAC was 1.202 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.49), which triggered early reporting for futility. The 4-year IDFS was 88.2% for TC6 and was 90.7% for TaxAC ( P = .04). Tests for treatment interaction by protocol, hormone receptor status, and nodal status were negative. Conclusion The TaxAC regimens improved IDFS in patients with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer compared with the TC6 regimen.",

Any positive level of estrogen receptor (ER) expression is considered sufficient to justify the use of endocrine adjuvant therapy in almost all patients. Overexpression or amplification of HER2 by standard criteria is an indication for anti-HER2 therapy for all but the very lowest risk invasive tumours. The corollary is that ER and HER2 must be reliably and accurately measured. Indications for cytotoxic adjuvant therapy were refined, acknowledging the role of risk factors with the caveat that risk per se is not a target. Proliferation markers, including those identified in multigene array analyses, were recognised as important in this regard. The threshold for indication of each systemic treatment modality thus depends on different criteria which have been separately listed to clarify the therapeutic decision-making algorithm.",

In the NSABP B-42 study, we aimed to determine whether extended letrozole treatment improves disease-free survival after 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy in women with postmenopausal breast cancer. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done in 158 centres in the USA, Canada, and Ireland. Postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who were disease-free after about 5 years of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 years of letrozole (2·5 mg orally per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by pathological node status, previous tamoxifen use, and lowest bone mineral density T score in the lumbosacral spine, total hip, or femoral neck. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as time from randomisation to breast cancer recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death, and was analysed by intention to treat. To adjust for previous interim analyses, the two-sided statistical significance level for disease-free survival was set at 0·0418. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  , is active, and is no longer enrolling patients. Results: Between Sept 28, 2006, and Jan 6, 2010, 3966 patients were randomly assigned to receive letrozole (n=1983) or placebo (n=1983). Follow-up information was available for 3903 patients for the analyses of disease-free survival. Median follow-up was 6·9 years (IQR 6·1-7·5). Letrozole treatment did not significantly improve disease-free survival (339 disease-free survival events were reported in the placebo group and 292 disease-free survival events were reported in the letrozole group; hazard ratio 0·85, 95% CI 0·73-0·999; p=0·048). 7-year disease-free survival estimate was 81·3% (95% CI 79·3-83·1) in the placebo group and 84·7% (82·9-86·4) in the letrozole group. The most common grade 3 adverse events were arthralgia (47 [2%] of 1933 patients in the placebo group vs 50 [3%] of 1941 patients in the letrozole group) and back pain (44 [2%] vs 38 [2%]). The most common grade 4 adverse event in the placebo group was thromboembolic event (eight [<1%]) and the most common grade 4 adverse events in the letrozole group were urinary tract infection, hypokalaemia, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (four [<1%] each). Conclusion: After 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy, 5 years of letrozole therapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival compared with placebo. Careful assessment of potential risks and benefits is required before recommending extended letrozole therapy to patients with early-stage breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: For most older women with early breast cancer, standard treatment after breast-conserving surgery is adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy and adjuvant endocrine treatment. We aimed to assess the effect omission of whole-breast radiotherapy would have on local control in older women at low risk of local recurrence at 5 years. Methods: Between April 16, 2003, and Dec 22, 2009, 1326 women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer judged low-risk (ie, hormone receptor-positive, axillary node-negative, T1-T2 up to 3 cm at the longest dimension, and clear margins; grade 3 tumour histology or lymphovascular invasion, but not both, were permitted), who had had breast-conserving surgery and were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment, were recruited into a phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 76 centres in four countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either whole-breast radiotherapy (40-50 Gy in 15-25 fractions) or no radiotherapy by computer-generated permuted block randomisation, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence. Follow-up continues and will end at the 10-year anniversary of the last randomised patient. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN95889329. Results: 658 women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and who were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation and 668 were allocated to no further treatment. After median follow-up of 5 years (IQR 3·84-6·05), ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was 1·3% (95% CI 0·2-2·3; n=5) in women assigned to whole-breast radiotherapy and 4·1% (2·4-5·7; n=26) in those assigned no radiotherapy (p=0·0002). Compared with women allocated to whole-breast radiotherapy, the univariate hazard ratio for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence in women assigned to no radiotherapy was 5·19 (95% CI 1·99-13·52; p=0·0007). No differences in regional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral breast cancers, or new breast cancers were noted between groups. 5-year overall survival was 93·9% (95% CI 91·8-96·0) in both groups (p=0·34). 89 women died; eight of 49 patients allocated to no radiotherapy and four of 40 assigned to radiotherapy died from breast cancer. Conclusion: Postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine treatment resulted in a significant but modest reduction in local recurrence for women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer 5 years after randomisation. However, the 5-year rate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence is probably low enough for omission of radiotherapy to be considered for some patients.",

This study focused on the updated survival data and the explorations of potential biomarkers for efficacy. Methods: Germ-line mutations of homologous recombination (HR) panel, BRCA1/2 included, were evaluated in 55.9% (132/236) patients. PD-L1 expression was evaluated in 48.3% (114/236) patients. A nonparametric sliding-window subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP) methodology was used to analyze the absolute survival benefits. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.46-9.00] months for GP arm and 6.07 (95% CI 5.32-6.83) months for GT arm (P = 0.005). No significant difference in overall survival (OS) was observed. There was significant interaction between HR status and treatment for PFS and status of HR deficient significantly correlated with higher objective response rate (ORR) and longer PFS in GP arm than in GT arm (71.9% versus 38.7%, P = 0.008; 10.37 versus 4.30 months, P = 0.011). There was no significant interaction between germ-line BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) status and treatment for PFS. Patients with gBRCA1/2 mutation had numerically higher ORR and prolonged PFS in GP arm than in GT arm (83.3% versus 37.5%, P = 0.086; 8.90 versus 3.20 months, P = 0.459). There was no significant interaction between PD-L1 status and treatment for PFS, and no significant differences in ORR, PFS or OS between two arms regardless of PD-L1 status. In STEPP analysis, patients with lower composite risks had more absolute benefits in PFS than those with higher composite risks. Conclusion: GP regimen has superior efficacy than GT regimen as first-line chemotherapy for mTNBC patients. Germ-line mutations of BRCA1/2 and HR panel are possible biomarkers for better performance of cisplatin-based regimens. A composite risk model was developed to guide patient selection for GP treatment in TNBC patients.",

Concomitant capecitabine may be beneficial, but robust data to support this are lacking. The efficacy and safety of the addition of capecitabine into the TNBC adjuvant treatment regimen was evaluated. Methods: This randomized, open-label, phase III trial was conducted in China. Eligible female patients with early TNBC after definitive surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to either capecitabine (3 cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of capecitabine, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or control treatment (3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Randomization was centralized without stratification. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Between June 2012 and December 2013, 636 patients with TNBC were screened, and 585 were randomly assigned to treatment (control, 288; capecitabine, 297). Median follow-up was 67 months.

Five-year overall survival rates were numerically higher but not significantly improved (capecitabine, 93.3%; control, 90.7%). Overall, 39.1% of patients had capecitabine dose reductions, and 8.4% reported grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome. The most common grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (capecitabine, 136 [45.8%]; control, 118 [41.0%]) and febrile neutropenia (capecitabine, 50 [16.8%]; control, 46 [16.0%]). Safety data were similar to the known capecitabine safety profile and generally comparable between arms. Conclusion: Capecitabine when added to 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of a 3-drug anthracycline combination containing capecitabine instead of fluorouracil significantly improved DFS in TNBC without new safety concerns.",

        "abstract": "Background: Ovarian failure is a common toxic effect of chemotherapy. Studies of the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to protect ovarian function have shown mixed results and lack data on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: We randomly assigned 257 premenopausal women with operable hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer to receive standard chemotherapy with the GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group) or standard chemotherapy without goserelin (chemotherapy-alone group). The primary study end point was the rate of ovarian failure at 2 years, with ovarian failure defined as the absence of menses in the preceding 6 months and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range. Rates were compared with the use of conditional logistic regression. Secondary end points included pregnancy outcomes and disease-free and overall survival. Results: At baseline, 218 patients were eligible and could be evaluated. Among 135 with complete primary end-point data, the ovarian failure rate was 8% in the goserelin group and 22% in the chemotherapy-alone group (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.97; two-sided P=0.04). Owing to missing primary end-point data, sensitivity analyses were performed, and the results were consistent with the main findings. Missing data did not differ according to treatment group or according to the stratification factors of age and planned chemotherapy regimen. Among the 218 patients who could be evaluated, pregnancy occurred in more women in the goserelin group than in the chemotherapy-alone group (21% vs. 11%, P=0.03); women in the goserelin group also had improved disease-free survival (P=0.04) and overall survival (P=0.05). Conclusion: Although missing data weaken interpretation of the findings, administration of goserelin with chemotherapy appeared to protect against ovarian failure, reducing the risk of early menopause and improving prospects for fertility.

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of letrozole compared with tamoxifen for patients with invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma. Methods: Patients diagnosed with early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) or classic invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) who were randomly assigned onto the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial and who had centrally reviewed pathology data were included (N = 2,923). HER2-negative IDC and ILC were additionally classified as hormone receptor-positive with high (luminal B [LB] -like) or low (luminal A [LA] -like) proliferative activity by Ki-67 labeling index. Survival analyses were performed with weighted Cox models that used inverse probability of censoring weighted modeling. Results: The median follow-up time was 8.1 years. In multivariable models for disease-free survival (DFS), significant interactions between treatment and histology (ILC or IDC; P = .006) and treatment and subgroup (LB like or LA like; P = .01) were observed. In the ILC subset, there was a 66% reduction in the hazard of a DFS event with letrozole for LB (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.55) and a 50% reduction for LA subtypes (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.78). In the IDC subset, there was a significant 35% reduction in the hazard of a DFS event with letrozole for the LB subtype (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79), but no difference between treatments was noted for IDC and the LA subtype (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20).

        "abstract": "Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for early breast cancer can make breast-conserving surgery more feasible and might be more likely to eradicate micrometastatic disease than might the same chemotherapy given after surgery. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of NACT and the influence of tumour characteristics on outcome with a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from relevant randomised trials. Methods: We obtained information about prerandomisation tumour characteristics, clinical tumour response, surgery, recurrence, and mortality for 4756 women in ten randomised trials in early breast cancer that began before 2005 and compared NACT with the same chemotherapy given postoperatively. Primary outcomes were tumour response, extent of local therapy, local and distant recurrence, breast cancer death, and overall mortality. Analyses by intention-to-treat used standard regression (for response and frequency of breast-conserving therapy) and log-rank methods (for recurrence and mortality). Results: Patients entered the trials from 1983 to 2002 and median follow-up was 9 years (IQR 5-14), with the last follow-up in 2013. Most chemotherapy was anthracycline based (3838 [81%] of 4756 women). More than two thirds (1349 [69%] of 1947) of women allocated NACT had a complete or partial clinical response. Patients allocated NACT had an increased frequency of breast-conserving therapy (1504 [65%] of 2320 treated with NACT vs 1135 [49%] of 2318 treated with adjuvant chemotherapy). NACT was associated with more frequent local recurrence than was adjuvant chemotherapy: the 15 year local recurrence was 21·4% for NACT versus 15·9% for adjuvant chemotherapy (5·5% increase [95% CI 2·4-8·6]; rate ratio 1·37 [95% CI 1·17-1·61]; p=0·0001). No significant difference between NACT and adjuvant chemotherapy was noted for distant recurrence (15 year risk 38·2% for NACT vs 38·0% for adjuvant chemotherapy; rate ratio 1·02 [95% CI 0·92-1·14]; p=0·66), breast cancer mortality (34·4% vs 33·7%; 1·06 [0·95-1·18]; p=0·31), or death from any cause (40·9% vs 41·2%; 1·04 [0·94-1·15]; p=0·45). Conclusion: Tumours downsized by NACT might have higher local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy than might tumours of the same dimensions in women who have not received NACT. Strategies to mitigate the increased local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy in tumours downsized by NACT should be considered-eg, careful tumour localisation, detailed pathological assessment, and appropriate radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 × 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab. Methods: Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed. Results: Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated. Conclusion: In stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent.",

However, the majority of patients do not experience a complete pathological response to primary chemotherapy and the significance of lesser degrees of histological response is uncertain and the prognostic significance is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new histological grading system to assess response of breast cancers to primary chemotherapy and to determine if such a system has prognostic value.A consecutive series of 176 patients with large (> or =4cm) and locally advanced breast cancers were treated with multimodality therapy comprising primary chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and tamoxifen. All underwent assessment of the primary breast tumour before and after completion of chemotherapy. Residual tumour was excised after completion of chemotherapy (mastectomy or wide local excision with axillary surgery). The removed tissue was assessed and response to chemotherapy graded using a five-point histological grading system based with the fundamental feature being a reduction in tumour cellularity; comparison being made with a pre-treatment core biopsy. All patients were followed up for 5 years or more. Pathological responses were compared to 5 year overall survival and disease-free survival using log rank tests. The overall 5-year survival for all patients was 71%, and 5 year disease free interval was 60%. There was a significant correlation between pathological response using this new grading system and both overall survival (P=0.02) and disease-free interval (P=0.04). In a multivariate analysis of known prognostic factors, the Miller/Payne grading system was an independent predictor of overall patient survival. This grading system, which assesses the histological response to primary chemotherapy, can predict overall survival and disease-free interval in patients with large and locally advanced breast cancers treated with such therapy. The relationship of degree of histological response to overall and disease-free survival has been shown in univariate and multivariate analyses and could potentially have an important role in the clinical management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing primary chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cisplatin, an effective medication for metastatic breast cancer (MBC), is recommended to be applied at the dose of 75 mg/m  on day 1 every 3 weeks. However, the 75 mg/m  schedule is often associated with a variety of side effects (such as vomiting and kidney toxicity), and time-consuming hydration treatment is usually needed. Divided dose (25 mg/m  on day 1-3) without hydration is an alternative. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles between these two dosage regimens. Methods: Patients with MBC treated with cisplatin-based regimens in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between December 2008 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity profiles were analyzed. Results: 227 patients receiving a 1-day schedule and 256 patients receiving a 3-day schedule were included. Median PFS was 6.68 (5.66-7.70) months for patients in the 1-day schedule group and 6.70 (5.89-7.52) months for patients in the 3-day schedule group. There was no statistically significant difference in PFS between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio, 0.942; 95% CI 0.759 to 1.170; P = 0.589). The ORRs were comparable between the two groups. ORRs were 44.9% in 1-day schedule group and 44.5% in 3-day schedule group, respectively (P = 0.929). Compared with patients in the 3-day schedule group, patients in the 1-day schedule group experienced higher rates of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) (139 [61.2%] vs. 132 [51.6%], P = 0.033). The risk of hypomagnesaemia was also significantly higher (43.2% vs. 28.3%, P = 0.016) among patients receiving 1-day schedule (without magnesium supplementation). No other differences in adverse events were observed between the two groups. Conclusion: Cisplatin given at three divided doses with no hydration in MBC is a less toxic (less CINV and hypomagnesaemia) schedule with comparable efficacy. Thus, it may be a good alternative for one full-dose (75 mg/m ) schedule.",

Our previous study classified TNBCs into four subtypes with putative therapeutic targets. Here, we conducted the FUTURE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ), a phase Ib/II subtyping-based and genomic biomarker-guided umbrella trial, to evaluate the efficacy of these targets. Patients with refractory metastatic TNBC were enrolled and stratified by TNBC subtypes and genomic biomarkers, and assigned to one of these seven arms: (A) pyrotinib with capecitabine, (B) androgen receptor inhibitor with CDK4/6 inhibitor, (C) anti PD-1 with nab-paclitaxel, (D) PARP inhibitor included, (E) and (F) anti-VEGFR included, or (G) mTOR inhibitor with nab-paclitaxel. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR). We enrolled 69 refractory metastatic TNBC patients with a median of three previous lines of therapy (range, 1-8). Objective response was achieved in 20 (29.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.7%-41.2%) of the 69 intention-to-treat (ITT) patients. Our results showed that immunotherapy (arm C), in particular, achieved the highest ORR (52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9%-75.6%) in the ITT population. Arm E demonstrated favorable ORR (26.1%, 95% CI: 10.2%-48.4% in the ITT population) but with more high grade (≥ 3) adverse events. Somatic mutations of TOP2A and CD8 immunohistochemical score may have the potential to predict immunotherapy response in the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC. In conclusion, the phase Ib/II FUTURE trial suggested a new concept for TNBC treatment, demonstrating the clinical benefit of subtyping-based targeted therapy for refractory metastatic TNBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: In breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the method of margin assessment and the definition of a negative margin vary widely. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of positive margins and rates of reexcision between two methods of margin assessment at a single institution. Methods: In July 2004, our protocol for margin evaluation changed from perpendicular inked margins (Group A, n=263) to tangential shaved margins (Group B, n=261). In Group A, margins were classified as positive, close, and negative. Margins designated as \"close\" were further defined as: < or = 1 mm, < or = 2 mm, and < or =3 mm. In Group B, shaved margins (by definition 2 to 3 mm) were reported as positive or negative. Results: The rate of reported \"positive\" margins was significantly higher in Group B: 127 of 261 (49%) versus 42 of 263 (16%), p < 0.001. But when patients with \"positive, close, or both\" kinds of margins were combined in Group A, there was no significant difference between the two techniques. Although the shaved margin was 2- to 3-mm thick, the rate of reexcision in Group B was significantly higher when compared with that in patients with \"positive, close, or both\" < or =3 mm margins in Group A (75% versus 52%, p < 0.001). The likelihood of finding residual disease remained the same (27% versus 32%, p=NS). Conclusion: The tangential shaved-margin technique results in a higher proportion of reported positive margins and limits the ability of the surgeon to discriminate among patients with close margins, resulting in a higher rate of reexcision. The fact that many, but not all, patients with positive or close margins in both groups underwent reexcision emphasizes the role of surgical judgment in this setting. Longer followup is required to determine equivalency in rates of local recurrence between these two methods of margin assessment.",

        "abstract": "Background: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) has eliminated the need for axillary dissection (ALND) in patients whose sentinel node (SN) is tumor-free. However, completion ALND for patients with tumor-involved SNs remains the standard to achieve locoregional control. Few studies have examined the outcome of patients who do not undergo ALND for positive SNs. We now report local and regional recurrence information from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial. Methods: American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 was a prospective trial examining survival of patients with SN metastases detected by standard H and E, who were randomized to undergo ALND after SLND versus SLND alone without specific axillary treatment. Locoregional recurrence was evaluated. Results: There were 446 patients randomized to SLND alone and 445 to SLND + ALND. Patients in the 2 groups were similar with respect to age, Bloom-Richardson score, estrogen receptor status, use of adjuvant systemic therapy, tumor type, T stage, and tumor size. Patients randomized to SLND + ALND had a median of 17 axillary nodes removed compared with a median of only 2 SN removed with SLND alone (P < 0.001). ALND also removed more positive lymph nodes (P < 0.001). At a median follow-up time of 6.3 years, there were no statistically significant differences in local recurrence (P = 0.11) or regional recurrence (P = 0.45) between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Despite the potential for residual axillary disease after SLND, SLND without ALND can offer excellent regional control and may be reasonable management for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy and adjuvant systemic therapy.",

In cohort B of the phase II KEYNOTE-086 study, we evaluated pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for patients with PD-L1-positive mTNBC. Methods: Eligible patients had centrally confirmed mTNBC, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for metastatic disease, measurable disease at baseline per RECIST v1.1 by central review, no radiographic evidence of central nervous system metastases, and a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score ≥1. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included objective response rate, disease control rate (percentage of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease for ≥24 weeks), duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Results: All 84 patients enrolled were women, and 73 (86.9%) received prior (neo)adjuvant therapy. Fifty-three (63.1%) patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs), including 8 patients (9.5%) with grade 3 severity; no patients experienced grade 4 AEs or died because of treatment-related AEs. Four patients had a complete response and 14 had a partial response, for an objective response rate of 21.4% (95% CI 13.9-31.4).

In cohort A of the phase II KEYNOTE-086 study, we evaluated pembrolizumab as second or later line of treatment for patients with mTNBC. Methods: Eligible patients had centrally confirmed mTNBC, ≥1 systemic therapy for metastatic disease, prior treatment with anthracycline and taxane in any disease setting, and progression on or after the most recent therapy. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Primary end points were objective response rate in the total and PD-L1-positive populations, and safety. Secondary end points included duration of response, disease control rate (percentage of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease for ≥24 weeks), progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: All enrolled patients (N = 170) were women, 61.8% had PD-L1-positive tumors, and 43.5% had received ≥3 previous lines of therapy for metastatic disease. ORR (95% CI) was 5.3% (2.7-9.9) in the total and 5.7% (2.4-12.2) in the PD-L1-positive populations. Disease control rate (95% CI) was 7.6% (4.4-12.7) and 9.5% (5.1-16.8), respectively. Median duration of response was not reached in the total (range, 1.2+-21.5+) and in the PD-L1-positive (range, 6.3-21.5+) populations. Median PFS was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9-2.0), and the 6-month rate was 14.9%. Median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI, 7.6-11.2), and the 6-month rate was 69.1%. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 103 (60.6%) patients, including 22 (12.9%) with grade 3 or 4 AEs. There were no deaths due to AEs.

        "abstract": "Background: Purpose This phase I study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antitumor activity, and predictive biomarkers of pyrotinib, an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor, in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients and Methods Pyrotinib was administered continuously, orally, once per day to patients who did not have prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of HER2. Planned dose escalation was 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, timed blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 28. Next-generation sequencing was performed on circulating tumor DNA and genomic DNA from tumor samples. Results Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea, which occurred in two patients administered 480 mg of pyrotinib; thus, the maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg. Common pyrotinib-related adverse events included diarrhea (44.7% [17 of 38]), nausea (13.2% [five of 38]), oral ulceration (13.2% [five of 38]), asthenia (10.5% [four of 38]), and leukopenia (10.5% [four of 38]). The only grade 3 adverse event was diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pyrotinib exposure was dose dependent. The overall response rate was 50.0% (18 of 36), and the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 61.1% (22 of 36). The median progression-free survival was 35.4 weeks (95% CI, 23.3 to 40.0 weeks). The overall response rate was 83.3% (10 of 12) in trastuzumab-naive patients and 33.3% (eight of 24) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Preliminary results suggest that PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in circulating tumor DNA ( P = .013) rather than in archival tumor tissues ( P = .474) may predict the efficacy of pyrotinib. Conclusion Continuous once-per-day pyrotinib was well tolerated and demonstrated promising antitumor activity in HER2-positive patients with metastatic breast cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was established as 400 mg. Diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxicity. The promising antitumor activity and acceptable tolerability of pyrotinib warrant its further evaluation in a phase II study.",

However, the key issue was the extent to which the benefit in PFS could translate into a prolongation of OS.   We performed a systematical literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials and Embase, as well as meeting online archives up to February 2020. The primary outcome was OS, and we performed indirect treatment comparisons depend on a meta-analysis.   Six RCTs were eligible including 3421 breast cancer patients. Compared to the endocrine therapy alone group, adding CDK4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy had significantly improved OS (HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.68-0.85, P<0.001). Moreover, the OS advantage was consistent in patients with different combined endocrine therapy, endocrine sensitivity status, sites of distant metastasis, menopausal status and age. Nevertheless, more adverse events were observed in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (risk ratio [RR]=37.15, 95% CI=15.33-90.04), leucopenia (RR=25.58, 95% CI=13.23-49.46) and anaemia (RR=2.24, 95% CI=1.38-3.85).   Our meta-analysis suggested that compared with endocrine therapy alone, the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly improved OS in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. However, the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors also increased the incidences of grade 3-4 adverse events.",

        "abstract": "Background: Complementary and Alternative Medication (CAM) is commonly used among women with breast cancer to improve their quality of life (QoL). However, few studies examine the prevalence of CAM and its' relation to the patients' QoL among women with breast cancer. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 95 women with breast cancer at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. The outcome measure of interest was the QoL. The correlation was used to assess the association between CAM use and QoL. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the factors that affect the use of CAM. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. Results: CAM use was reported by 81.1% of the study participants. The most commonly used CAM therapy was spiritual therapy 70.5%, followed by honey 36.8%, olive oil 24.2% and 23.2% herbal therapy. We found that those who were undergoing cancer treatment had a significantly higher percentage of CAM usage as compared to those not undergoing cancer therapy (72.6% vs. 8.4%,  =0.008). With regards to QoL, there was a statistically significant difference between CAM users and non-CAM users in global health status (73.2% vs. 64.8%,   = 0.049). Conclusion: CAM therapy was commonly used among women in our study sample which was correlated with higher overall global QoL. As CAM is widely used, health care providers may need to discuss the use of CAM with breast cancer women and be up to date on the benefits and risk of CAM use through well-equipped training programs and workshops.",

        "abstract": "Background: Technetium labeled methylene diphosphonate bone scans (BSs) are commonly used to monitor disease progression in bone for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, new BS lesions may represent osteoblastic bone healing, which we now define as bone pseudoprogression. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical significance and determination methods of bone pseudoprogression. Methods: This retrospective analysis was conducted among 48 patients with hormone receptor-positive MBC treated with first-line endocrine therapy. Four months after initiating therapy, all the participants did not show extraosseous disease progression. Participants were divided into two groups according to the presence of new BS lesions. All the patients continued on treatment until explicit disease progression (extraosseous disease progression or progressive lysis on bone lesions). Explicit progression-free survival (PFS) and extraosseous objective response rate were analyzed between the two groups. Results: New BS lesions were observed in 11 of 48 (22.9%) patients. All the new BS lesions appeared as osteoblastic bone lesions on computed tomography. For patients with new BS lesions, the median PFS was 26.57 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 15.46-37.68], which was similar to that (29.57 months; 95% CI 19.24-39.90) in patients without new BS lesions [hazard ratio: 1.098 (95% CI 0.482-2.503),   = 0.818]. Notably, 82.9% of patients without new BS lesions showed an extraosseous objective response, whereas 85.7% of patients with new BS lesions demonstrated an extraosseous objective response [odds ratio: 0.806 (95% CI 0.061-5.682),   = 0.999]. The median interval between bone pseudoprogression and true disease progression was 21.26 months (95% CI 10.11-32.42). Conclusion: Osteoblastic new BS lesions detected on follow-up BSs may represent bone pseudoprogression. Clinicians should raise awareness of bone pseudoprogression, thereby avoiding premature discontinuation of therapy and maximizing the opportunity to benefit from endocrine therapy. Due to the small sample size and retrospective nature of the study, large prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm our findings.",

The Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastases (SABR-COMET) randomized phase 2 trial was originally designed with 5 years of follow-up, but the trial was amended in 2016 to extend follow-up to 10 years. Herein we report oncologic outcomes beyond 5 years. Methods: Patients were eligible if they had a controlled primary tumor and 1 to 5 metastases, with all metastases amenable to SABR. Patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard-of-care treatment (control arm) versus SABR to all metastases plus standard of care (SABR arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General [FACT-G]), and time to new metastases. Results: Ninety-nine patients were randomized between 2012 and 2016 (n = 33 in arm 1 vs n = 66 in arm 2). Primary tumor sites included lung (n = 18), breast (n = 18), colon (n = 18), prostate (n = 16), and other (n = 29). Eight-year OS was 27.2% in the SABR arm versus 13.6% in the control arm (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.84; P = .008). Eight-year PFS estimates were 21.3% versus 0.0%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.72; P < .001). Rates of grade ≥ 2 acute or late toxic effects were 30.3% versus 9.1% (P = .019), with no new grade 3 to 5 toxic effects. FACT-G quality of life scores declined over time in both arms, but there were no differences in quality of life scores between arms. The use of systemic therapy overall was similar between arms, but patients in the SABR arm were less likely to require cytotoxic chemotherapy (33.3% vs 54.6%, respectively, P = .043). Conclusion: SABR achieved durable improvements in OS and PFS, with no new major toxicity signals with extended follow-up. A minority of patients randomized to the SABR arm (21.3%) achieved > 5 years of survival without recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Background: The increase in cancer incidence and mortality is challenging current cancer care delivery globally, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) when it comes to receiving evidence-based cancer prevention, treatment, and palliative and survivorship care. Patients in LMICs often rely on traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) that is more familiar, less costly, and widely available. However, spheres of influence and tensions between conventional medicine and TCIM can further disrupt efforts in evidence-based cancer care. Integrative oncology provides a framework to research and integrate safe, effective TCIM alongside conventional cancer treatment and can help bridge health care gaps in delivering evidence-informed, patient-centered care. This growing field uses lifestyle modifications, mind and body therapies (eg, acupuncture, massage, meditation, and yoga), and natural products to improve symptom management and quality of life among patients with cancer. On the basis of this review of the global challenges of cancer control and the current status of integrative oncology, the authors recommend: 1) educating and integrating TCIM providers into the cancer control workforce to promote risk reduction and culturally salient healthy life styles; 2) developing and testing TCIM interventions to address cancer symptoms or treatment-related adverse effects (eg, pain, insomnia, fatigue); and 3) disseminating and implementing evidence-based TCIM interventions as part of comprehensive palliative and survivorship care so patients from all cultures can live with or beyond cancer with respect, dignity, and vitality. With conventional medicine and TCIM united under a cohesive framework, integrative oncology may provide citizens of the world with access to safe, effective, evidence-informed, and culturally sensitive cancer care.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of locoregional treatment (LRT) in BC patients with de novo stage IV bone only metastasis (BOM). Methods: The prospective, multicenter registry study BOMET MF14-01 was initiated in May 2014. Patients with de novo stage IV BOM BC were divided into two groups: those receiving systemic treatment (ST group) and those receiving LRT (LRT group). Patients who received LRT were further divided into two groups: ST after LRT (LRT + ST group) and ST before LRT (ST + LRT group). Results: We included 505 patients in this study; 240 (47.5%) patients in the ST group and 265 (52.5%) in the LRT group. One hundred and thirteen patients (26.3%) died in the 34-month median follow-up, 85 (35.4%) in the ST group and 28 (10.5%) in LRT group. Local progression was observed in 39 (16.2%) of the patients in the ST group and 18 (6.7%) in the LRT group (p = 0.001).

        "abstract": "Background: The phase III MONALEESA-3 trial included first- (1L) and second-line (2L) patients and demonstrated a significant overall survival (OS) benefit for ribociclib + fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in the final protocol-specified and exploratory (longer follow-up) OS analyses. At the time of these analyses, the full OS benefit of 1L ribociclib was not completely characterized because the median OS (mOS) was not reached. As CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) + endocrine therapy (ET) is now a preferred option for 1L HR+/HER2- ABC, we report an exploratory analysis (median follow-up, 70.8 months; 14.5 months longer than the prior analysis) to fully elucidate the OS benefit in the MONALEESA-3 1L population. Methods: Postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- ABC were randomized 2:1 to 1L/2L fulvestrant + ribociclib or placebo. OS in 1L patients (de novo disease or relapse > 12 months from completion of [neo]adjuvant ET) was assessed by Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier methods. Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) were analyzed. MONALEESA-3 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( ). Results: At data cutoff (January 12, 2022; median follow-up time, 70.8 months), mOS was 67.6 versus 51.8 months with 1L ribociclib versus placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67; 95% CI 0.50-0.90); 16.5% and 8.6% of ribociclib and placebo patients, respectively, were still receiving treatment. PFS2 (HR 0.64) and CFS (HR 0.62) favored ribociclib versus placebo. Among those who discontinued treatment, 16.7% and 35.0% on ribociclib or placebo, respectively, received a subsequent CDK4/6i. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusion: This analysis of MONALEESA-3 reports the longest mOS thus far (67.6 months) for 1L patients in a phase III ABC trial. These results in a 1L population show that the OS benefit of ribociclib was maintained through extended follow-up, further supporting its use in HR+/HER2- ABC.",

However, discrepancies have been reported between clinical trial and real-world outcomes. We report real-world outcomes for patients with HER2-positive MBC treated with first-line pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and a taxane in routine clinical practice in the United States. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using electronic health record-derived deidentified data from the Flatiron Health database. Patients were grouped according to the first taxane received (paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel or docetaxel). Median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Subgroup analyses were conducted in patients treated with docetaxel who met CLEOPATRA's key eligibility criteria. Results: We included 1,065 patients; 313 patients received paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel and 752 received docetaxel. Patients who received paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel were older, had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, and had more recurrent metastatic disease compared with the docetaxel group. After adjustment for potential confounders, similar median rwPFS (inverse probability of treatment weighted average treatment effect for the treated [IPTW-ATT] hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3;   = .365) and rwOS (IPTW-ATT HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.58;   = .101) was observed between treatment groups. In the subgroup of CLEOPATRA-eligible patients, median rwPFS and rwOS were 16.9 months and 57.8 months, respectively. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in real-world outcomes between patients treated with paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel and those treated with docetaxel. Selecting patients using key CLEOPATRA eligibility criteria resulted in rwPFS and rwOS similar to those observed in CLEOPATRA, highlighting the importance of ensuring similar patient populations when comparing clinical trial and real-world data.",

        "abstract": "Background: Combined modality therapy has become the treatment of choice for patients with primary breast cancer, including those with locally advanced breast cancer. Primary or induction chemotherapy, followed by surgery or radiation therapy or both, and adjuvant systemic therapy is a generally accepted strategy. Most tumors respond with a more than 50% decrease in tumor size, and approximately 70% of patients experience down-staging through primary chemotherapy. Breast conservation is possible for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and almost all patients initially are rendered disease free. Primary chemotherapy should be the initial choice of treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors, but it is unclear what the optimal sequence of subsequent therapies should be, or whether one or two local treatment modalities are necessary. The most dramatic example of the efficacy of these regimens was demonstrated in patients with inflammatory breast cancer. Previously a universally fatal condition, the natural history of this disease has been changed dramatically by the introduction of these combined modality therapies. Five-year survival rates of 35-60% commonly are reported, and it is likely that about one third of patients with this highly aggressive form of disease will survive beyond 10 years without recurrence. Combined modality therapy that includes primary chemotherapy provides appropriate local control, the possibility of breast conservation therapy, and, probably, an increased survival rate, at least for some subsets of patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The use of similar treatment strategies for early breast cancer is currently under evaluation. Hormone therapy and combination chemotherapy represent the main treatment approaches to metastatic breast cancer. Radiotherapy is also a useful palliative tool, especially for control of painful bone metastases and central nervous system involvement. Patient and tumor characteristics help in the optimal selection of systemic therapy. Palliative therapy for symptomatic control and prolongation of life also preserves a good quality of life. Dose-intensive chemotherapy is being evaluated as a treatment to increase complete response rates and cause remission consolidation. Clinical trials on several new and effective cytotoxic agents, as well as new hormonal compounds, are being completed and are showing encouraging preliminary results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Background: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical exercise (PE), and of these two interventions combined (CBT/PE) on menopausal symptoms (primary outcome), body image, sexual functioning, psychological well-being, and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) in patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause. Methods: Patients with breast cancer reporting treatment-induced menopausal symptoms (N=422) were randomly assigned to CBT (n=109), PE (n=104), CBT/PE (n=106), or to a waiting list control group (n=103). Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Multilevel procedures were used to compare the intervention groups with the control group over time. Results: Compared with the control group, the intervention groups had a significant decrease in levels of endocrine symptoms (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms; P<.001; effect size, 0.31-0.52) and urinary symptoms (Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire; P=.002; effect size, 0.29-0.33), and they showed an improvement in physical functioning (36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning subscale; P=.002; effect size, 0.37-0.46). The groups that included CBT also showed a significant decrease in the perceived burden of hot flashes and night sweats (problem rating scale of the Hot Flush Rating Scale; P<.001; effect size, 0.39-0.56) and an increase in sexual activity (Sexual Activity Questionnaire habit subscale; P=.027; effect size, 0.65). Most of these effects were observed at both the 12-week and 6-month follow-ups. Conclusion: CBT and PE can have salutary effects on endocrine symptoms and, to a lesser degree, on sexuality and physical functioning of patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause. Future work is needed to improve the design and the planning of these interventions to improve program adherence.",

        "abstract": "Background: Toxicity due to treatment causes a negative impact on quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Hot flash symptoms, described as intense sensations of heat, sweating and flushing occur in more than 50 % of breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen. We hypothesized that venlafaxine, a selective-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor drug, was effective for reducing patient-reported hot flash scores among women treated for breast cancer compared to other non-hormonal treatments. We searched Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception till May 2015 for venlafaxine (75 mg once daily or greater) with non-hormonal comparators for the treatment of hot flashes in female breast cancer patients. The primary outcome was hot flash score (derived from patient-reported hot flash severity and frequency) in randomized controlled trials. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each study due to variation in the outcome measures. Heterogeneity was determined using I (2) statistics, and publication bias was assessed using a contour funnel plot and Egger's tests. Pooled analyses demonstrated that venlafaxine significantly reduced hot flash scores compared to the trial comparators (overall SMD 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.40, 3.72]). There was significant heterogeneity among these studies (I (2) = 98.7%, P < 0.001). Asymmetry in the contour funnel plot suggests the presence of publication bias and a trend towards small study effects (Egger's test, P = 0.096). Venlafaxine is efficacious in managing hot flashes among women with breast cancer. This review highlights methodological issues that arise from eligible trials and recommends a collaborative approach in survivorship studies.",

        "abstract": "Background: Patient-centered decision making about hot flash treatments often incorporates a balance of efficacy and side effects in addition to patient preference. This systematic review examines randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing at least two non-hormonal hot flash treatments in breast cancer survivors. In July 2015, PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched for RCTs comparing active, non-hormonal hot flash treatments in female breast cancer survivors. Thirteen trials were included after identifying 906 potential studies. Four trials were dose comparison studies of pharmacologic treatments citalopram, venlafaxine, gabapentin, and paroxetine. Hot flash reduction did not differ by tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor use. Citalopram 10, 20, and 30 mg daily had comparable outcomes. Venlafaxine 75 mg daily improved hot flashes without additional side effects from higher dosing. Gabapentin 900 mg daily improved hot flashes more than 300 mg. Paroxetine 10 mg daily had fewer side effects than 20 mg. Among four trials comparing different pharmacologic treatments, venlafaxine alleviated hot flash symptoms faster than clonidine; participants preferred venlafaxine over gabapentin. Five trials compared pharmacologic to non-pharmacologic treatments. Acupuncture had similar efficacy to venlafaxine and gabapentin but may have longer durability after completing treatment and fewer side effects. We could not perform a pooled meta-analysis because outcomes were not reported in comparable formats. Clinical trial data on non-hormonal hot flash treatments provide comparisons of hot flash efficacy and other patient important outcomes to guide clinical management. Clinicians can use the information to help patients select hot flash interventions.",

        "abstract": "Background: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem. While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear. Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT. The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm. Methods: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm. Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190). The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence. However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up. A long term follow-up has now been performed. Results: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9). Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls. There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013). No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found. Conclusion: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports. The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure. As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions. Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT. Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors. Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",

        "abstract": "Background: To provide updated evidence- and consensus-based guideline recommendations to practicing oncologists and others on the management of brain metastases for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer up to 2021. Methods: An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review (for both systemic therapy for non-CNS metastases and for CNS metastases of HER2+ guideline updates) that identified 545 articles. Outcomes of interest included overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events. Results: Of the 545 publications identified and reviewed, six on systemic therapy were identified to form the evidentiary basis for the systemic therapy for CNS metastases guideline recommendations. Conclusion: Patients with brain metastases should receive appropriate local therapy and systemic therapy, if indicated. Local therapies include surgery, whole-brain radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery. Memantine and hippocampal avoidance should be added to whole-brain radiotherapy when possible. Treatments depend on factors such as patient prognosis, presence of symptoms, resectability, number and size of metastases, prior therapy, and whether metastases are diffuse. Other options include systemic therapy, best supportive care, enrollment onto a clinical trial, and/or palliative care. There are insufficient data to recommend for or against performing routine magnetic resonance imaging to screen for brain metastases; clinicians should have a low threshold for magnetic resonance imaging of the brain because of the high incidence of brain metastases among patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Background: Bone metastases are common in patients with advanced breast cancer. Given the significant associated morbidity, the introduction of new, effective systemic therapies, and the improvement in survival time, early detection and response assessment of skeletal metastases have become even more important. Although planar bone scanning has recognized limitations, in particular, poor specificity in staging and response assessment, it continues to be the main method in current clinical practice for staging of the skeleton in patients at risk of bone metastases. However, the accuracy of bone scanning can be improved with the addition of SPECT/CT. There have been reported improvements in sensitivity and specificity for staging of the skeleton with either bone-specific PET/CT tracers, such as (18)F-NaF, or tumor-specific tracers, such as (18)F-FDG, although these methods are less widely available and more costly. There is a paucity of data on the use of (18)F-NaF PET/CT for response assessment in breast cancer, but there is increasing evidence that (18)F-FDG PET/CT may improve on current methods in this regard. At the same time, interest and experience in using whole-body morphologic MRI augmented with diffusion-weighted imaging for both staging and response assessment in the skeleton have been increasing. However, data on comparisons of these methods with PET methods to determine the best technique for current clinical practice or for clinical trials are insufficient. There are early data supporting the use (18)F-FDG PET/MRI to assess malignant disease in the skeleton, with the possibility of taking advantage of the synergies offered by combining morphologic, physiologic, and metabolic imaging.",

Patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton who are receiving intravenous, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws; these patients represent 94% of published cases. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. Oversuppression of bone turnover is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this condition, although there may be contributing comorbid factors. All sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. Conservative débridement of necrotic bone, pain control, infection management, use of antimicrobial oral rinses, and withdrawal of bisphosphonates are preferable to aggressive surgical measures for treating this condition. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring.",

The results of a recent large randomized trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology [CALGB/Alliance 70604]) showed that zoledronic acid (ZA) every 3 months was noninferior to monthly ZA in reducing the risks of SREs. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) of monthly ZA, ZA every 3 months, and monthly denosumab in women with breast cancer and skeletal metastases. Methods Using a Markov model, costs per SRE avoided were calculated for the three treatments. Sensitivity analyses were performed where denosumab SRE probabilities were assumed to be 50%, 75%, and 90% lower than the ZA SRE probabilities. Quality-adjusted life-years were also calculated. The analysis was from the US payer perspective. Results The mean costs of the denosumab treatment strategy are nine-fold higher than generic ZA every 3 months. Quality-adjusted life-years were virtually identical in all the three treatment arms; hence, the optimal treatment would be ZA every 3 months because it was the least costly treatment. The sensitivity analyses showed that relative to ZA every 3 months, the incremental costs per mean SRE avoided for denosumab ranged from $162,918 to $347,655. Conclusion ZA every 3 months was more CE in reducing the risks of SRE than monthly denosumab. This analysis was one of the first to incorporate the costs of generic ZA and one of the first independent CE analyses not sponsored by either Novartis or Amgen, the makers of ZA and denosumab, respectively. ZA every 3 months is the more CE option and more reasonable alternative to monthly denosumab.",

Sample sizes ranged from 7 to 98 patients. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis of results was performed. One study of 98 patients suggested that vaginal pH-balanced gel (mean VHI 5.00 ± 0.816, mean VMI 51.18 ± 3.753) was more efficient than placebo (VHI 16.98 ± 3.875, p < 0.001, VMI 47.87 ± 2.728, p < 0.001) at 12 weeks in providing vaginal symptom relief.

        "abstract": "Background: Most patients with metastatic cancer eventually develop resistance to systemic therapy, with some having limited disease progression (ie, oligoprogression). We aimed to assess whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) targeting oligoprogressive sites could improve patient outcomes. Methods: We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised controlled trial of SBRT in patients with oligoprogressive metastatic breast cancer or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after having received at least first-line systemic therapy, with oligoprogression defined as five or less progressive lesions on PET-CT or CT. Patients aged 18 years or older were enrolled from a tertiary cancer centre in New York, NY, USA, and six affiliated regional centres in the states of New York and New Jersey, with a 1:1 randomisation between standard of care (standard-of-care group) and SBRT plus standard of care (SBRT group). Randomisation was done with a computer-based algorithm with stratification by number of progressive sites of metastasis, receptor or driver genetic alteration status, primary site, and type of systemic therapy previously received. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, measured up to 12 months. We did a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by disease site. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  , and is complete. Results: From Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2021, 106 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care (n=51; 23 patients with breast cancer and 28 patients with NSCLC) or SBRT plus standard of care (n=55; 24 patients with breast cancer and 31 patients with NSCLC). 16 (34%) of 47 patients with breast cancer had triple-negative disease, and 51 (86%) of 59 patients with NSCLC had no actionable driver mutation. The study was closed to accrual before reaching the targeted sample size, after the primary efficacy endpoint was met during a preplanned interim analysis. The median follow-up was 11·6 months for patients in the standard-of-care group and 12·1 months for patients in the SBRT group. The median progression-free survival was 3·2 months (95% CI 2·0-4·5) for patients in the standard-of-care group versus 7·2 months (4·5-10·0) for patients in the SBRT group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·53, 95% CI 0·35-0·81; p=0·0035). The median progression-free survival was higher for patients with NSCLC in the SBRT group than for those with NSCLC in the standard-of-care group (10·0 months [7·2-not reached] vs 2·2 months [95% CI 2·0-4·5]; HR 0·41, 95% CI 0·22-0·75; p=0·0039), but no difference was found for patients with breast cancer (4·4 months [2·5-8·7] vs 4·2 months [1·8-5·5]; 0·78, 0·43-1·43; p=0·43). Grade 2 or worse adverse events occurred in 21 (41%) patients in the standard-of-care group and 34 (62%) patients in the SBRT group. Nine (16%) patients in the SBRT group had grade 2 or worse toxicities related to SBRT, including gastrointestinal reflux disease, pain exacerbation, radiation pneumonitis, brachial plexopathy, and low blood counts. Conclusion: The trial showed that progression-free survival was increased in the SBRT plus standard-of-care group compared with standard of care only. Oligoprogression in patients with metastatic NSCLC could be effectively treated with SBRT plus standard of care, leading to more than a four-times increase in progression-free survival compared with standard of care only. By contrast, no benefit was observed in patients with oligoprogressive breast cancer. Further studies to validate these findings and understand the differential benefits are warranted.",

We report efficacy and safety outcomes, including the final OS and safety outcomes from follow-up in HER2CLIMB. Methods: HER2CLIMB is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases. Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive tucatinib or placebo, in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. After the primary analysis (median follow-up of 14 months), the protocol was amended to allow for unblinding sites to treatment assignment and cross-over from the placebo combination to the tucatinib combination. Protocol prespecified descriptive analyses of OS, PFS (by investigator assessment), and safety were carried out at ∼2 years from the last patient randomized. Results: Six hundred and twelve patients enrolled in the HER2CLIMB trial. At a median OS follow-up of 29.6 months, median duration of OS was 24.7 months for the tucatinib combination group versus 19.2 months for the placebo combination group [hazard ratio (HR) for death: 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59-0.90, P = 0.004] and OS at 2 years was 51% and 40%, respectively. HRs for OS across prespecified subgroups were consistent with the HR for the overall study population. Median duration of PFS was 7.6 months for the tucatinib combination group versus 4.9 months for the placebo combination group (HR for progression or death: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47-0.70, P < 0.00001) and PFS at 1 year was 29% and 14%, respectively. The tucatinib combination was well tolerated with a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events.

        "abstract": "Background: To develop recommendations concerning the management of male breast cancer. Methods: ASCO convened an Expert Panel to develop recommendations based on a systematic review and a formal consensus process. Results: Twenty-six descriptive reports or observational studies met eligibility criteria and formed the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. Conclusion: Many of the management approaches used for men with breast cancer are like those used for women. Men with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who are candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered tamoxifen for an initial duration of five years; those with a contraindication to tamoxifen may be offered a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist plus aromatase inhibitor. Men who have completed five years of tamoxifen, have tolerated therapy, and still have a high risk of recurrence may be offered an additional five years of therapy. Men with early-stage disease should not be treated with bone-modifying agents to prevent recurrence, but could still receive these agents to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Men with advanced or metastatic disease should be offered endocrine therapy as first-line therapy, except in cases of visceral crisis or rapidly progressive disease. Targeted systemic therapy may be used to treat advanced or metastatic cancer using the same indications and combinations offered to women. Ipsilateral annual mammogram should be offered to men with a history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy regardless of genetic predisposition; contralateral annual mammogram may be offered to men with a history of breast cancer and a genetic predisposing mutation. Breast magnetic resonance imaging is not recommended routinely. Genetic counseling and germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes should be offered to all men with breast cancer.",

Herein, we report results overall and by subgroups with extended follow-up. Methods: In this double-blind, phase 3 study, post-menopausal women with ER+/HER2- ABC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease were randomized 2:1 to palbociclib-letrozole or placebo-letrozole. Endpoints include investigator-assessed PFS (primary), safety, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Results: After a median follow-up of approximately 38 months, median PFS was 27.6 months for palbociclib-letrozole (n = 444) and 14.5 months for placebo-letrozole (n = 222) (HR 0.563; 1-sided P < 0.0001). All subgroups benefited from palbociclib treatment. The improvement of PFS with palbociclib-letrozole was maintained in the next 2 subsequent lines of therapy and delayed the use of chemotherapy (40.4 vs. 29.9 months for palbociclib-letrozole vs. placebo-letrozole). Safety data were consistent with the known profile. Patients' quality of life was maintained. Conclusion: With approximately 15 months of additional follow-up, palbociclib plus letrozole continued to demonstrate improved PFS compared with placebo plus letrozole in the overall population and across all patient subgroups, while the safety profile remained favorable and quality of life was maintained. These data confirm that palbociclib-letrozole should be considered the standard of care for first-line therapy in patients with ER+/HER2- ABC, including those with low disease burden or long disease-free interval.

        "abstract": "Background: Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of patients with germline BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer, representing the first targeted therapy capable of improving outcomes in patients with hereditary tumors. However, resistance to PARP inhibitors occurs in almost all patients. Methods: This narrative review summarizes the biological rationale behind the use of PARP inhibitors in breast cancer, as well as the available evidence, recent progress, and potential future applications of these agents. Recent studies have shown that the benefit of PARP inhibitors extends beyond patients with germline BRCA1/2-associated metastatic breast cancer to patients with somatic BRCA1/2 variants and to those with germline PALB2 alterations. Moreover, these agents proved to be effective both in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. However, patients with metastatic breast cancer usually do not achieve the long-term benefit from PARP inhibitors observed in other tumor types. Mechanisms of resistance have been identified, but how to effectively target them is largely unknown. Ongoing research is investigating both novel therapeutics and new combination strategies to overcome resistance. PARP1-selective inhibitors, by sparing the hematological toxic effects induced by the PARP2 blockade, are promising agents to be combined with chemotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates, and other targeted therapies. Results: Although the efficacy of PARP inhibitors is well established, many questions persist. Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance. Integrating well-designed translational efforts into all clinical studies is thereby crucial to laying the groundwork for future insights from ongoing research.",

Methods: In the phase II non-comparative DORA trial ( ), patients with ongoing stable disease (SD) or complete/partial response (CR/PR) to first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy for TNBC (≤10% estrogen/progesterone receptor expression) were randomized 1:1 to receive olaparib 300 mg twice daily with or without durvalumab 1,500 mg on day 1 every 4 weeks.

Results: 45 patients were randomized (23 to olaparib alone, 22 to the combination; 3 with estrogen/progesterone receptor expression 1%-10%). At 9.8 months' median follow-up, median PFS from randomization was 4.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-6.1] months with olaparib and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.7-10.1) months with the combination, both significantly longer than the historical control (P = 0.0023 and P < 0.0001, respectively).

        "abstract": "Background: Combined targeting of CDK4/6 and ER is now the standard of care for patients with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. However, acquired resistance to these therapies frequently leads to disease progression. As such, it is critical to identify the mechanisms by which resistance to CDK4/6-based therapies is acquired and also identify therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance. Methods: In this study, we developed and characterized multiple in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to CDK4/6-based therapies. Resistant models were screened by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) for cell signaling changes that are activated in resistance. Results: We show that either a direct loss of Rb or loss of dependence on Rb signaling confers cross-resistance to inhibitors of CDK4/6, while PI3K/mTOR signaling remains activated. Treatment with the p110α-selective PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib (BYL719), completely blocked the progression of acquired CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant xenografts in the absence of continued CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment in models of both PIK3CA mutant and wild-type ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Triple combination therapy against PI3K:CDK4/6:ER prevented and/or delayed the onset of resistance in treatment-naive ER+/HER2- breast cancer models. Conclusion: These data support the clinical investigation of p110α-selective inhibitors of PI3K, such as alpelisib, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer who have progressed on CDK4/6:ER-based therapies. Our data also support the investigation of PI3K:CDK4/6:ER triple combination therapy to prevent the onset of resistance to the combination of endocrine therapy plus CDK4/6 inhibition.",

The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints are objective response rate (ORR), safety and overall survival (OS). The trial has met pre-specified endpoints. The median PFS is 9.8 months with AP as compared to 7.4 months with GP (stratified HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.88; P = 0.004). AP significantly increases ORR (81.1% vs. 56.3%, P < 0.001) and prolongs OS (stratified HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.90; P = 0.010) to GP. Of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, a significantly higher incidence of neuropathy in AP and thrombocytopenia in GP is noted.

        "abstract": "Background: Increasing physical activity can improve cognition in healthy and cognitively impaired adults; however, the benefits for cancer survivors are unknown. The current study examined a 12-week physical activity intervention, compared with a control condition, on objective and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Sedentary breast cancer survivors were randomized to an exercise arm (n = 43) or a control arm (n = 44). At baseline and at 12 weeks, objective cognition was measured with the National Institutes of Health Cognitive Toolbox, and self-reported cognition using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales. Linear mixed-effects regression models tested intervention effects for changes in cognition scores. Results: On average, participants (n = 87) were aged 57 years (standard deviation, 10.4 years) and were 2.5 years (standard deviation, 1.3 years) post surgery. Scores on the Oral Symbol Digit subscale (a measure of processing speed) evidenced differential improvement in the exercise arm versus the control arm (b = 2.01; P < .05). The between-group differences in improvement on self-reported cognition were not statistically significant but were suggestive of potential group differences. Time since surgery moderated the correlation, and participants who were ≤2 years post surgery had a significantly greater improvement in Oral Symbol Digit score (exercise vs control (b = 4.00; P < .01), but no significant improvement was observed in patients who were >2 years postsurgery (b = -1.19; P = .40). A significant dose response was observed with greater increased physical activity associated with objective and self-reported cognition in the exercise arm. Conclusion: The exercise intervention significantly improved processing speed, but only among those who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 2 years. Slowed processing speed can have substantial implications for independent functioning, supporting the potential importance of early implementation of an exercise intervention among patients with breast cancer.

Methods: Women with histologically confirmed stage IV breast cancer, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status 0 to 2, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive CAF (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 day 1, and fluorouracil [FU] 200 mg/m2 intravenous bolus days 1 to 5) with or without LV (LV 200 mg/m2 over 30 minutes days 1 to 5 given 1 hour before FU). Results: Two hundred forty-two patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 124 patients had visceral crisis and 40 patients had a CALGB performance status score of 2. The median follow-up was 6 years. The two study arms were similar with regard to serious adverse events; four patients died from treatment-related causes, two patients on each study arm. Predictive variables for time to treatment failure and survival were visceral disease and performance status. The overall response rate was 29% for CAF versus 28% for CAF plus LV. The median time to treatment failure (9 months) and median survival (1.7 years) did not differ by treatment arm. Conclusion: Modulation of CAF with LV improved neither response rates nor survival among women with metastatic breast cancer, compared with CAF alone. Multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic importance of performance status and visceral crisis. However, the overall and complete response rates, response durations, time to treatment failure, and survival were the same in the two treatment arms.",

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the survival of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and negative metastatic breast cancer irradiated for brain metastases before and after the availability of trastuzumab (T). Methods: Women diagnosed with brain metastasis from breast cancer in two eras between 2000 and 2007 (T-era, n = 441) and 1986 to 1992 (PreT-era, n = 307), treated with whole brain radiotherapy (RT) were identified. In the T-era, HER2 testing was part of routine clinical practice, and in the preT-era 128/307 (42%) cases had HER2 testing performed retrospectively on tissue microarrays. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons between eras used log-rank tests. Results: In the preT- and T-era cohorts, the rate of HER2 positivity was 40% (176/441) and 26% (33/128) (p < 0.001). The median time from diagnosis to brain RT was longer in the preT-era (3.3 years versus 2.3 years, p < 0.001). Survival after brain RT was improved in the T-era compared to the preT-era (1-year OS 26% versus 12%, p < 0.001). The 1-year OS rate for HER2 negative patients was 20% in both eras (p = 0.97). Among HER2 positive patients, the 1-year OS in the preT-era was 5% compared to 40% in the T-era (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Distinct from patients with HER2 negative disease in whom no difference in survival after brain RT was observed over time, patients with HER2 positive brain metastases experienced significantly improved survival subsequent to the availability of trastuzumab.",

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = 1,026) or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n = 1,020) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression). Results: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; P = .001). Reduction in bone turnover markers was greater with denosumab. Overall survival, disease progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between groups. An excess of renal AEs and acute-phase reactions occurred with zoledronic acid; hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (2.0%, denosumab; 1.4%, zoledronic acid; P = .39). Conclusion: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing SREs in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well tolerated. With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no requirement for renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential treatment option for patients with bone metastases.",

A 78-year-old man was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (T4d N3 M1, stage IV). He had advanced breast cancer consisting of multiple tumors with skin involvement and redness over the entire left chest region. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a metastatic tumor in the left lung. Histologically, both the primary breast cancer and the metastatic lung tumor were identified as invasive ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor-negative (ER)(-) and progesterone receptor-negative (PgR)(-), with a HER2 score of 3+ (IHC). The patient received a combination chemotherapy using trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Two months later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the left lung tumor had disappeared, suggesting a good response to trastuzumab and paclitaxel. During trastuzumab treatment, no severe adverse events above grade 3 were observed. This is the first reported case of advanced HER2-positive male breast cancer in which a good response to trastuzumab and paclitaxel was demonstrated at both primary breast cancer and metastatic sites.",

        "abstract": "Background: The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with antiestrogen therapies significantly improves clinical outcomes in ER-positive advanced breast cancer. To identify mechanisms of acquired resistance, we analyzed serial biopsies and rapid autopsies from patients treated with the combination of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib with letrozole. This study revealed that some resistant tumors acquired RB loss, whereas other tumors lost PTEN expression at the time of progression. In breast cancer cells, ablation of  , through increased AKT activation, was sufficient to promote resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition   and  . Mechanistically,   loss resulted in exclusion of p27 from the nucleus, leading to increased activation of both CDK4 and CDK2. Because   loss also causes resistance to PI3Kα inhibitors, currently approved in the post-CDK4/6 setting, these findings provide critical insight into how this single genetic event may cause clinical cross-resistance to multiple targeted therapies in the same patient, with implications for optimal treatment-sequencing strategies. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis of serial biopsies uncovered RB and PTEN loss as mechanisms of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, utilized as first-line treatment for ER-positive advanced breast cancer. Importantly, these findings have near-term clinical relevance because   loss also limits the efficacy of PI3Kα inhibitors currently approved in the post-CDK4/6 setting. .",

        "abstract": "Background: Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more previous therapies for advanced disease have few effective treatment options. The monarcHER trial aimed to compare the efficacy of abemaciclib plus trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant with standard-of-care chemotherapy of physician's choice plus trastuzumab in women with advanced breast cancer. Methods: This phase 2, three-group, open-label trial was done across 75 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 14 countries. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older, who had hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously received at least two HER2-targeted therapies for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to the abemaciclib, trastuzumab, and fulvestrant (group A), abemaciclib and trastuzumab (group B), or standard-of-care chemotherapy and trastuzumab (group C). Oral abemaciclib 150 mg 12 hourly was administered on days 1-21 of a 21-day cycle, intravenous trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on cycle 1 day 1, followed by 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle, and intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg on days 1, 15, and 29 and once every 4 weeks thereafter. Standard-of-care chemotherapy was administered as specified by the product label. Randomisation was by a computer-generated random sequence by means of an interactive web-response system and stratified by number of previous systemic therapies for advanced breast cancer and measurable versus non-measurable disease. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, first testing group A versus group C and, if this result was significant, then group B versus group C. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( ) and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up. Results: Between May 31, 2016, and Feb 28, 2018, 325 patients were screened, of whom 237 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups A (n=79), B (n=79), and C (n=79). Median follow-up was 19·0 months (IQR 14·7-25·1). The study met its primary endpoint, showing a significant difference at the prespecified two-sided α of 0·2 in median progression-free survival between group A (8·3 months, 95% CI 5·9-12·6) and group C (5·7 months, 5·4-7·0; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·45-1·00]; p=0·051). No difference was observed between median progression-free survival in group B (5·7 months, 95% CI 4·2-7·2) and group C (HR 0·94 [0·64-1·38]; p=0·77). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event in groups A, B, and C was neutropenia (21 [27%] of 78 patients, 17 [22%] of 77, and 19 [26%] of 72). The most common serious adverse events were: in group A, pyrexia (three [4%]), diarrhoea (two [3%]), urinary tract infection (two [3%]), and acute kidney injury (two [3%]); in group B, diarrhoea (two [3%]) and pneumonitis (two [3%]); and in group C, neutropenia (four [6%]) and pleural effusion (two [3%]). Two deaths were attributed to treatment: one due to pulmonary fibrosis in group B and one due to febrile neutropenia in group C. Conclusion: The combination of abemaciclib, fulvestrant, and trastuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy plus trastuzumab while showing a tolerable safety profile. Our results suggest that a chemotherapy-free regimen might potentially be an alternative treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer in whom disease progresses or there is recurrence while taking a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) are usually treated with exemestane (EXE), but no single standard of care exists in this setting. The BOLERO-2 trial demonstrated that adding everolimus (EVE) to EXE improved progression-free survival (PFS) while maintaining quality of life when compared with EXE alone. Because many women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer are elderly, the tolerability profile of EVE plus EXE in this population is of interest. Methods: BOLERO-2, a phase III randomized trial, compared EVE (10 mg/d) and placebo (PBO), both plus EXE (25 mg/d), in 724 postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer recurring/progressing after treatment with NSAIs. Safety and efficacy data in elderly patients are reported at 18-month median follow-up. Results: Baseline disease characteristics and treatment histories among the elderly subsets (≥ 65 years, n = 275; ≥ 70 years, n = 164) were generally comparable with younger patients. The addition of EVE to EXE improved PFS regardless of age (hazard ratio, 0.59 [≥ 65 years] and 0.45 [≥ 70 years]). Adverse events (AEs) of special interest (all grades) that occurred more frequently with EVE than with PBO included stomatitis, infections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia. Elderly EVE-treated patients had similar incidences of these AEs as did younger patients but had more on-treatment deaths. Conclusion: Adding EVE to EXE offers substantially improved PFS over EXE and was generally well tolerated in elderly patients with HR(+) advanced breast cancer. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose reductions or interruptions for AE management are recommended during treatment with EVE in this patient population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) affect 65-85% of women after breast cancer treatment; they are distressing, causing sleep problems and decreased quality of life. Hormone replacement therapy is often either undesirable or contraindicated. Safe, effective non-hormonal treatments are needed. We investigated whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help breast cancer survivors to effectively manage HFNS. Methods: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited women from breast clinics in London, UK, who had problematic HFNS (minimum ten problematic episodes a week) after breast-cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either usual care or usual care plus group CBT (1:1). Randomisation was done in blocks of 12-20 participants, stratifying by age (younger than 50 years, 50 years or older), and was done with a computer-generated sequence. The trial statistician and researchers collecting outcome measures were masked to group allocation. Group CBT comprised one 90 min session a week for 6 weeks, and included psycho-education, paced breathing, and cognitive and behavioural strategies to manage HFNS. Assessments were done at baseline, 9 weeks, and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference in HFNS problem rating (1-10) between CBT and usual care groups at 9 weeks after randomisation. Analysis of the primary endpoint was done by modified intention to treat. The trial is registered, ISRCTN13771934, and was closed March 15, 2011. Results: Between May 5, 2009, and Aug 27, 2010, 96 women were randomly allocated to group CBT (n=47) or usual care (n=49). Group CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 9 weeks after randomisation compared with usual care (mean difference -1·67, 95% CI -2·43 to -0·91; p<0·0001) and improvements were maintained at 26 weeks (mean difference -1·76, -2·54 to -0·99; p<0·0001). We recorded no CBT-related adverse events. Conclusion: Group CBT seems to be a safe and effective treatment for women who have problematic HFNS after breast cancer treatment with additional benefits to mood, sleep, and quality of life. The treatment could be incorporated into breast cancer survivorship programmes and delivered by trained breast cancer nurses.",

        "abstract": "Background: Mind-body therapies are commonly recommended to treat vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence to date for the efficacy of different mind-body therapies to alleviate HFNS in healthy menopausal women and breast cancer survivors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using seven electronic search engines, direct searches of specific journals and backwards searches through reference lists of related publications. Outcome measures included HFNS frequency and/or severity or self-reported problem rating at post-treatment. The methodological quality of all studies was systematically assessed using predefined criteria. Twenty-six RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included yoga (n = 5), hypnosis (n = 3), mindfulness (n = 2), relaxation (n = 7), paced breathing (n = 4), reflexology (n = 1) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 4). Findings were consistent for the effectiveness of CBT and relaxation therapies for alleviating troublesome vasomotor symptoms. For the remaining interventions, although some trials indicated beneficial effects (within groups) at post-treatment and/or follow up, between group findings were mixed and overall, methodological differences across studies failed to provide convincing supporting evidence. Collectively, findings suggest that interventions that include breathing and relaxation techniques, as well as CBT, can be beneficial for alleviating vasomotor symptoms. Additional large, methodologically rigorous trials are needed to establish the efficacy of interventions on vasomotor symptoms, examine long-term outcomes and understand how they work.",

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 41 patients with bone-only metastatic breast cancer and assigned responses according to the MDA and WHO criteria. We analysed whether the MDA or WHO response classifications correlated with PFS and OS. Results: With the MDA criteria, there were significant differences in PFS between patients classified as responders and those classified as nonresponders (P=0.025), but with the WHO criteria, there were not. Neither criteria distinguished responders from nonresponders in terms of OS. MDA response criteria correlated better than WHO response criteria with clinical response assessment. Conclusion: The MDA classification is superior to the WHO classification in differentiating between responders and nonresponders among breast cancer patients with bone-only metastases. Application of the MDA classification may allow bone lesions to be considered measurable disease. Prospective study is needed to test the MDA classification among patients with bone metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the efficacy of topical vaginal estrogens in comparison to hyaluronic acid for the treatment of de novo dyspareunia in women using hormonal oral contraceptive (COC). Methods: Consecutive sexually active women using COC and complaining of de novo dyspareunia were enrolled in the study. Two attending physicians were involved in the study: the first, prescribed a 12-week vaginal estrogenic therapy with estriol 50 μg/g gel twice a week (group 1) and the second a hyaluronic acid vaginal gel therapy once a day (group 2). We evaluated dyspareunia levels using visual analogic scale (VAS) and sexual function using Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Vaginal atrophy was graded per the vaginal maturation index (VM). Results: Overall, 31 women were enrolled. Seventeen and 14 patients were allocated in group 1 and 2, respectively. In both groups, after the topical therapy, dyspareunia, sexual function and VM were significantly improved. However, patients in group 1 experienced a significantly lower score of dyspareunia than patients in the group 2 (2 (1-7) vs. 4 (2-7); p=0.02). Additionally, women in the group 1 had higher FSFI (29.20 (24.60-34.50) vs. 28.10 (23.60-36.50); p=0.04) scores and VM (73.80 (±8.78) vs. 64.50 (±12.75); p=0.003) values in comparison to the patients in group 2. Conclusion: Our study showed that vaginal supplementation with estriol 50 μg/g gel or with hyaluronic acid could reduce the de novo dyspareunia related to COC. In this cluster of patients, both treatments improve sexuality. However, estriol 50 μg/g gel appears to be significantly more effective in comparison with hyaluronic acid.",

        "abstract": "Background: We performed a retrospective study on the efficacy and safety of sirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) in hormone receptor (HR)-positive advanced breast cancer and searched for biomarkers to predict its efficacy. Methods: All patients with HR-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with sirolimus plus endocrine therapy between December 2017 and July 2018 at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were consecutively and retrospectively reviewed. Mutations in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) were assayed for 1021 tumour-related genes via gene panel target capture-based next-generation sequencing. Results: Thirty-six patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with sirolimus plus endocrine therapy were included. The progression-free survival (PFS) rates between the sirolimus group and everolimus group were similar, and the median PFS was 4.9 months and 5.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio 1.56, 95% CI 0.86-2.81, P = 0.142). The objective response rate in the 36 patients was 19.4%, and the clinical benefit rate was 41.7%. Lipid metabolism disorder was the most common adverse event (69.4%), and 13.9% of patients had stomatitis. Most (94.4%) adverse events were grade 1-2. Twenty patients (55.6%) underwent ctDNA analysis before receiving sirolimus therapy. For patients who received less than 3 lines of chemotherapy, those with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations had a better response to sirolimus than those without alterations, with a median PFS of 7.0 months vs 4.3 months (hazard ratio = 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.34, P = 0.010). Conclusion: Sirolimus is a potentially effective treatment option for patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer.",

Tamoxifen is effective in this entity, but unfortunately there is little information on aromatase inhibitors (AI) or fulvestrant. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). In this report we report 11 months of progression-free survival, without any adverse events, in a patient who received trastuzumab and anastrozole therapy. We conclude that this combination is a reasonable option in men with ER+ and Her2+ advanced breast cancer.",

Methods: In this open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial, pre/perimenopausal women with clinically aggressive HR+/HER2- ABC were randomly assigned 1:1 to first-line ribociclib (600 mg once daily; 3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus letrozole/anastrozole and goserelin or investigator's choice of combination CT (docetaxel plus capecitabine, paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, or capecitabine plus vinorelbine). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Among 222 patients randomly assigned to ribociclib plus ET (n = 112) or combination CT (n = 110), 150 (67.6%) had symptomatic visceral metastases, 41 (18.5%) had rapid disease progression per investigator's judgment, and 31 (14.0%) had symptomatic nonvisceral disease. Overall, 106 (47.7%) patients had investigator-assessed visceral crisis. The median follow-up time was 37.0 months. At data cutoff, 31.3% (ribociclib arm) and 15.5% (CT arm) of patients had completed study treatment and transitioned to post-trial access. The median PFS was 21.8 months (ribociclib plus ET; [95% CI, 17.4 to 26.7]) and 12.8 months (combination CT; [95% CI, 10.1 to 18.4); hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.87];   = .003. The overall response rates and the median time to response in the ribociclib versus CT arms, respectively, were 66.1% and 61.8% and 4.9 months and 3.2 months (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06]). Lower rates of symptomatic adverse events were observed in the ribociclib versus CT arm. Conclusion: First-line ribociclib plus ET showed a significant PFS benefit, similar response rates, and better tolerability over combination CT in patients with clinically aggressive HR+/HER2- ABC.",

The randomized HABITS study, which compared HT for menopausal symptoms with best management without hormones among women with previously treated breast cancer, was stopped early due to suspicions of an increased risk of new breast cancer events following HT. We present results after extended follow-up. Methods: HABITS was a randomized, non-placebo-controlled noninferiority trial that aimed to be at a power of 80% to detect a 36% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for a new breast cancer event following HT. Cox models were used to estimate relative risks of a breast cancer event, the maximum likelihood method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and chi(2) tests were used to assess statistical significance, with all P values based on two-sided tests. The absolute risk of a new breast cancer event was estimated with the cumulative incidence function. Most patients who received HT were prescribed continuous combined or sequential estradiol hemihydrate and norethisterone. Results: Of the 447 women randomly assigned, 442 could be followed for a median of 4 years. Thirty-nine of the 221 women in the HT arm and 17 of the 221 women in the control arm experienced a new breast cancer event (HR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.2). Cumulative incidences at 5 years were 22.2% in the HT arm and 8.0% in the control arm. By the end of follow-up, six women in the HT arm had died of breast cancer and six were alive with distant metastases. In the control arm, five women had died of breast cancer and four had metastatic breast cancer (P = .51, log-rank test). Conclusion: After extended follow-up, there was a clinically and statistically significant increased risk of a new breast cancer event in survivors who took HT.",

The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors for extracranial oligometastatic breast cancer and to identify the best treatment approaches in this select population. Fifty postoperative inpatients diagnosed with extracranial oligometastatic breast cancer at the National Cancer Center in China between 2009 and 2014 were consecutively enrolled. Oligometastatic breast cancer was defined as MBC with three or fewer metastatic lesions confined to one organ; de novo Stage IV disease and local-regional recurrence were excluded. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were 15.2 and 78.9 months, respectively, and the 2-year PFS and 5-year OS rates were 40% and 58%, respectively. First-line treatment approach with standard systemic treatment + surgical resection for all metastatic lesions was an independent prognostic factor for prolonged PFS (hazard ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.73; P = .006) and OS (hazard ratio = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86; P = .022). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a disease-free interval (DFI) ≥24 months, one metastatic lesion or the hormone receptor (HR) + subtype were more likely to get benefit from resection. Patients with oligometastatic breast cancer have a relatively good prognosis. Surgical resection for metastatic lesions could significantly improve PFS and OS.

Results: Twenty-one patients (48%) had early stage disease (0, I, II) at diagnosis. With 70.8 months median follow-up, complete control of axillary recurrence was achieved in 31 patients (71%). Distant metastases developed in 50% and were more likely with uncontrolled axillary recurrences. Failure to receive multimodality therapy and failure to undergo surgery for the recurrence correlated with resistant axillary disease. Conclusion: Axillary recurrence from breast cancer is uncommon but may follow any stage of disease. One half of affected patients develop distant metastases.

The phase 3b/4 DESTINY-Breast12 study investigated T-DXd in patients with HER2  mBC and is, to our knowledge, the largest prospective study of T-DXd in patients with BMs in this setting. Patients (stable/active BMs (n = 263) and no BMs (n = 241)) treated with one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens received T-DXd (5.4 mg per kg). Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS; BMs cohort) and objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (non-BMs cohort). Additional endpoints included central nervous system (CNS) PFS, ORR, time to second progression, CNS ORR (BMs cohort), incidence of new symptomatic CNS metastases (non-BMs cohort), time to progression, duration of response, overall survival and safety (both cohorts). No formal hypothesis testing was conducted for this single-arm, open-label study. In the BMs cohort, 12-month PFS was 61.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.9-67.6), and 12-month CNS PFS was 58.9% (95% CI: 51.9-65.3). In the non-BMs cohort, ORR was 62.7% (95% CI: 56.5-68.8). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 51% (BMs cohort) and 49% (non-BMs cohort) of patients. Investigator-reported interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in 16% (grade ≥3: 3%) of patients with BMs and 13% (grade ≥3: 1%) of patients without BMs. These data show substantial and durable overall and intracranial activity for T-DXd, supporting its use in previously treated patients with HER2  mBC irrespective of stable/active baseline BMs. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:   .",

This study was to compare platinum-based regimen with nonplatinum regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced TNBC. Methods: Eligible metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) women without prior treatment for advanced disease were randomized (1 : 1) to receive either docetaxel-cisplatin (TP) or docetaxel -capecitabine (TX) q3w for up to 6 cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In total 53 patients were enrolled. Results: The median follow-up was 24 months. ORR was higher in the TP group than in the TX group (63.0% versus 15.4%, P = 0.001).

Final efficacy secondary end point analyses and post hoc analyses of outcomes stratified by Trop-2 expression and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status are reported. Updated safety analyses are provided.In this final analysis, SG (n = 267) improved median progression-free survival (PFS; 4.8   1.7 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.41 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.52]) and median overall survival (OS; 11.8   6.9 months; HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.63]) over TPC (n = 262). SG improved PFS over TPC in each Trop-2 expression quartile (n = 168); a trend was observed for improved OS across quartiles. Overall, SG had a manageable safety profile, with ≤5% of treatment-related discontinuations because of adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. The safety profile was consistent across all subgroups.These data confirm the clinical benefit of SG over chemotherapy, reinforcing SG as an effective treatment option in patients with mTNBC in the second line or later.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Chinese bridging study PUFFIN ( ) aimed to assess consistency of efficacy with CLEOPATRA ( ), investigating pertuzumab with trastuzumab and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with previously untreated HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1, stratified by visceral/non-visceral disease and hormone receptor status. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (in patients with measurable baseline disease), overall survival, and safety. The consistency threshold for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] < 0.81) (maintaining ≥ 50% of the risk reduction determined in CLEOPATRA [HR 0.62]) determined the target sample size (n = 240). Results: Two hundred forty-three patients were randomized. Median PFS was 14.5 months in the pertuzumab arm (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5, 18.6) and 12.4 months in the placebo arm (95% CI 10.4, 12.7) in the intention-to-treat population (HR: 0.69 [95% CI 0.49, 0.99]). Objective responses were recorded in 83/105 (79.0%) and 67/97 (69.1%) patients, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events (70.5% and 69.2%, respectively) and serious adverse events (19.7% and 19.2%, respectively) were similar across both arms. No heart failure cases or symptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction declines were reported. Conclusion: PUFFIN met its primary objective. Overall, efficacy data were consistent with CLEOPATRA. Safety was consistent with the known pertuzumab safety profile.

        "abstract": "Background: Trastuzumab (Tmab), pertuzumab (Pmab), and taxane has been a standard first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic human epidermal growth factor (HER2)-positive breast cancer (HER2  mBC) but has some safety issues due to taxane-induced toxicities. This has led to ongoing efforts to seek less toxic alternatives to taxanes that are equally effective when used in combination with Tmab plus Pmab. This study aims to show the non-inferiority of eribulin, a non-taxane microtubule inhibitor, against taxane, as a partner for dual HER2 blockade. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, phase III study will involve a total of 480 Japanese women with HER2  mBC who meet the following requirements: (1) age 20-70 years; (2) no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (excluding trastuzumab-emtansine) for mBC; (3) ≥ 6 months after prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy; (4) presence of any radiologically evaluable lesion; (5) left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%; (6) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1; (7) adequate organ function; and (8) life expectancy of at least 6 months. They will be randomized 1:1 to receive eribulin (1.4 mg/m  on days 1 and 8) or taxane (docetaxel 75 mg/m  on day 1 or paclitaxel 80 mg/m  on days 1, 8, and 15) in combination with Tmab (8 mg/kg then 6 mg/kg) plus Pmab (840 mg then 420 mg) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The treatment will be continued until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival as per investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, overall survival, quality of life and safety. Non-inferiority will be tested with two margins of 1.33 and 1.25 in a stepwise manner. If non-inferiority is shown with a margin of 1.25, superiority will then be tested. Results: If this study shows the non-inferiority, or even superiority, of Tmab, Pmab, and eribulin against the existing taxane-containing regimen, this new regimen may become a standard first- or second-line treatment option for HER2  mBC in Japan.

        "abstract": "Background: The use of trastuzumab in combination with either a taxane or vinorelbine has improved the efficacy of treatment for women with HER2-positive (HER+) breast cancer. We investigated the activity and toxicity of the gemcitabine/trastuzumab combination as first- or second-line treatment in women with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Forty-one women with HER2+ MBC were treated with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously (I.V.) days 1, 8, and 15 and trastuzumab 4-mg/kg I.V. loading dose and then 2 mg/kg weekly. Cycles were repeated every 28 days. Patients were evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment; responders/stable patients continued treatment until progression. Results: Patients received a median of 28 weeks of treatment. Eleven of 37 evaluable patients (30%; 95% CI, 17%-46%) had major responses. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4 months (95% CI, 1.9-5.3 months), with a 1-year PFS of 17%. Four of 15 patients (27%) who had previously received trastuzumab for MBC had partial responses. The gemcitabine/trastuzumab combination was well tolerated. Conclusion: The combination of gemcitabine and trastuzumab is an active regimen but appears less active than trastuzumab in combination with either taxanes or vinorelbine. The role of gemcitabine/trastuzumab (versus gemcitabine alone) in women who have already received a trastuzumab-containing regimen for HER2+ MBC is not defined by this study.",

To decrease stomatitis and subsequently early treatment discontinuations or dose reductions, the DESIREE trial investigated the use of a stepwise dose-escalation schedule of everolimus (EVE esc). Methods: DESIREE is a phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with HR+/HER2- mBC and progression/relapse after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor treatment. Patients were randomised to EVE esc (2.5 mg/day, week 1; 5 mg/day, week 2; 7.5 mg/day, week 3; 10 mg/day, weeks 4-24) or everolimus 10 mg/day (EVE 10mg) for 24 weeks plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was the incidence of stomatitis episodes grade ≥2 within 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints included toxicity, relative total dose intensity (RTDI) and quality of life (QoL). Results: A total of 160 patients were randomised and 156 started treatment (EVE esc: 80; EVE 10mg: 76). The median age of patients was 64 years (range 33-85), 56.3% patients in the EVE esc arm versus 42.1% in the EVE 10mg arm had liver metastasis (P = 0.081) and 62.5% versus 51.3% received over one metastatic therapy line (P = 0.196). Within 12 weeks, the incidence of stomatitis episodes grade ≥2 was significantly lower in the EVE esc arm compared with the EVE 10mg arm (28.8% versus 46.1%; odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.92; P = 0.026). Toxicity was in line with the known safety profile without new safety concerns. The median RTDI was 91.1% in the EVE esc arm versus 80.0% in the EVE 10mg arm (P = 0.329). Discontinuation rate in the first 3 weeks was 6.3% versus 15.8%, respectively (P = 0.073). QoL was comparable between the two treatment arms. Conclusion: A dose-escalation schema of everolimus over 3 weeks can be successfully used to reduce the incidence of high-grade stomatitis in the first 12 weeks of treatment in patients with HR+/HER2- mBC.",

The use of local therapy was related to younger age, lower clinical T and N stage, no skin involvement and no progression during induction chemotherapy. The use of surgery was related to younger age, lower clinical T and N stage, no clinical skin involvement and response to induction chemotherapy. The use of postoperative radiotherapy was correlated with larger tumor size, higher number of positive lymph nodes, positive surgical margin, extracapsular lymph node extension, lymphatic vessel invasion and skin involvement. Results: The most frequent local therapy in LABC remains a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Clinical and pathological characteristics influence the type of local treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: The features and survival of stage IV breast cancer patients with different metastatic sites are poorly understood. This study aims to examine the clinicopathological features and survival of stage IV breast cancer patients according to different metastatic sites. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we restricted our study population to stage IV breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 to 2015. The clinicopathological features were examined by chi-square tests. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared among patients with different metastatic sites by the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable analyses were also performed using the Cox proportional hazard model to identify statistically significant prognostic factors. Results: A total of 18,322 patients were identified for survival analysis. Bone-only metastasis accounted for 39.80% of patients, followed by multiple metastasis (33.07%), lung metastasis (10.94%), liver metastasis (7.34%), other metastasis (7.34%), and brain metastasis (1.51%). The Kaplan-Meier plots showed that patients with bone metastasis had the best survival, while patients with brain metastasis had the worst survival in both BCSS and OS (p < 0.001, for both). Multivariable analyses showed that age, race, marital status, grade, tumor subtype, tumor size, surgery of primary cancer, and a history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: Stage IV breast cancer patients have different clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes according to different metastatic sites. Patients with bone metastasis have the best prognosis, and brain metastasis is the most aggressive subgroup.",

        "abstract": "Background: Multiple studies have suggested that resection of the primary tumor improves survival in patients with stage IV breast cancer, yet in the era of targeted therapy, the relation between surgery and tumor molecular subtype is unknown. The objective of the current study was to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from primary tumor treatment and assess the frequency of local disease progression. Methods: Patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer and intact primary tumors (n = 186) were identified from a prospectively maintained clinical database (2000-2004) and clinical data were abstracted (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). Results: Surgery was performed in 69 (37%) patients: 34 (49%) patients with unknown metastatic disease at the time of surgery, 15 (22%) patients for local control, 14 (20%) patients for palliation, and in 6 (9%) patients to obtain tissue. Surgical patients were more likely to be HER-2/neu negative (P = .001), and to have smaller tumors (P = .05) and solitary metastasis (P <.001). Local therapy included axillary lymph node clearance in 33 (48%) patients and postoperative radiotherapy in 9 (13%) patients. The median survival was 35 months. Cox regression analysis identified estrogen receptor (ER) positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.29-0.76), progesterone receptor (PR) positivity (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90), and HER-2/neu amplification (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.77) as being predictive of improved survival. There was a trend toward improved survival with surgery (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.06). On exploratory analyses, surgery was found to be associated with improved survival in patients with ER/PR positive or HER-2/neu-amplified disease (P = .004). No survival benefit was observed in patients with triple-negative disease. Conclusion: Although a trend toward improved survival with surgery was observed, it was noted most strongly in patients with ER/PR positive and/or HER-2/neu-amplified disease. This suggests that the impact of local control is greatest in the presence of effective targeted therapy, and supports the need for further study to define patient subsets that will benefit most.",

        "abstract": "Background: Our aim was to evaluate the impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease and on the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. Methods: The medical records of 125 consecutive patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer referred for FDG PET from January 1998 through May 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. The rationale for FDG PET referral and the impact of FDG PET on subsequent treatment decisions for patients were determined by chart review. The impact of FDG PET on defining the extent of disease was determined by comparing the FDG PET interpretation at the time of the examination with findings from conventional imaging (CI) performed before FDG PET. FDG PET results were confirmed in nearly half (n = 61) of the patients by histopathology (n = 23) or follow-up imaging (n = 38; mean follow-up interval, 21.3 months). Results: Patients were referred for FDG PET for the following reasons: evaluation of disease response or viability after therapy (n = 43 [35%]), local recurrence, with intent of aggressive local treatment (n = 39 [31%]), equivocal findings on CI (n = 25 [20%]), evaluation of disease extent in patients with known metastases (n = 13 [10%]), and elevated tumor markers with unknown disease site (n = 5 [4%]). Compared with CI findings, the extent of disease increased in 54 (43%), did not change in 41 (33%), and decreased in 30 (24%) of 125 patients using FDG PET. Results of FDG PET altered the therapeutic plan in 40 (32%), directly helped to support the therapeutic plan in 34 (27%), and did not change the plan devised before FDG PET in 51 (41%) of 125 patients. FDG PET altered therapy most frequently in the patients suspected of having locoregional recurrence and in those being evaluated for treatment response versus other referral categories (p = 0.04). For patients with confirmation of FDG PET findings, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG PET were 94%, 91%, and 92%, respectively. Conclusion: FDG PET contributes significantly to defining the extent of disease and deciding on treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is one of the most important toxicities of antiresorptive therapy, which is standard practice for patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. However, the population-based incidence of MRONJ is not well established. We therefore performed a retrospective multicenter study to assess the incidence for a whole Austrian federal state (Tyrol). Methods: This retrospective multicenter study was conducted between 2000 and 2020 at all nine breast centers across Tyrol, Austria. Using the cancer registry, the total Tyrolean population was screened for all patients with breast cancer. All patients with breast cancer and bone metastases receiving antiresorptive therapy were finally included in the study. Results: From 8,860 patients initially screened, 639 individuals were eligible and included in our study. Patients received antiresorptive therapy once per month without de-escalation of therapy. MRONJ was diagnosed in 56 (8.8%, 95% CI, 6.6 to 11.0) patients. The incidence of MRONJ was 11.6% (95% CI, 8.0 to 15.3) in individuals treated with denosumab only, 2.8% (95% CI, 0.7 to 4.8) in those treated with bisphosphonates only, and 16.3% (95% CI, 8.8 to 23.9) in the group receiving bisphosphonates followed by denosumab. Individuals developed MRONJ significantly earlier when treated with denosumab. Time to MRONJ after treatment initiation was 4.6 years for individuals treated with denosumab only, 5.1 years for individuals treated with bisphosphonates only, and 8.4 years for individuals treated with both consecutively. Conclusion: MRONJ incidence in breast cancer patients with bone metastases was found to be considerably higher, especially for patients receiving denosumab, when compared with available data in the literature. Additionally, patients treated with denosumab developed MRONJ significantly earlier.",

Capivasertib-fulvestrant is approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with one or more tumor biomarker alterations (PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN). Here, we report outcomes in the CAPItello-291 subgroup of patients from Japan. Methods: Adults with HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer whose disease had relapsed or progressed during or after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with or without previous cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapy, were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive capivasertib or placebo, plus fulvestrant. The dual primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS in the overall and PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered population. Safety was a secondary endpoint. Results: Of 708 patients randomized in CAPItello-291, 78 were from Japan (37 randomized to capivasertib-fulvestrant and 41 to placebo-fulvestrant). In the Japan subgroup, PFS numerically favored the capivasertib-fulvestrant arm (hazard ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.40-1.28), consistent with the analysis of PFS in the global population. Similarly, in the Japan subgroup of patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors, PFS favored the capivasertib-fulvestrant arm (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.29-1.39), consistent with the global population. The adverse event profile of capivasertib-fulvestrant in the Japan subgroup was broadly similar to that in the global population; no new safety concerns were identified. Conclusion: Outcomes in the Japan subgroup were broadly similar to those of the global population, supporting the clinical benefit of capivasertib-fulvestrant in treating HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer that has progressed on, or after, an endocrine-based regimen.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials. This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Methods: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57). Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance. Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months. No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned. Results: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81). Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81). The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%). Conclusion: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: Platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) has proven benefits in phase III studies for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients; however, real-world data of large samples from multiple centers are lacking. Our study was to compare the effectiveness of PBC and non-PBC in advanced TNBC patients in multicenter real-world settings. Totally, 495 patients with advanced TNBC receiving PBC (n = 350) or non-PBC (n = 145) at four cancer centers in China between 2003 and 2019 were included. Treatment responses and outcomes were compared between the two groups from first-line to third-line treatment. Of patients with PBC, 249 (71.1%) received PBC from first-line chemotherapy, 86 (24.6%) from second-line and 15 (4.3%) from third-line treatment. In first-line treatment, PBC was superior to non-PBC in objective response rate (ORR, 53.0% vs 32.1%, P < .001) and median progression-free survival (PFS, 8.4 vs 6.0 months, P = .022), whereas overall survival (OS) was similar (19.2 vs 16.8 months, P = .439). When comparing patients receiving non-PBC doublets (n = 221) with those receiving PBC doublets (n = 249), the same trend was observed in ORR (32.6% vs 53.0%, P < .001), median first-line PFS (6.5 vs 8.4 months, P = .041) and median first-line OS(17.8 vs 19.2 months, P = .568). Paclitaxel/docetaxel + platinum was more likely to be used, followed by gemcitabine + platinum. In second/third-line treatment, PBC yielded a similar response and survival compared to non-PBC. Adding PBC in the first-line therapy was better than that in the latter-line of treatment in terms of ORR, PFS and OS (P < .001). Toxic effects of PBC were tolerable and the most common adverse event was neutropenia (38.6%). PBC doublets exhibited superior efficacy and manageable toxicity compared to non-PBC doublets in the first-line treatment for Chinese mTNBC patients.",

Methods: Patients without baseline CNS metastases were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive lapatinib-capecitabine (lapatinib 1,250 mg per day; capecitabine 2,000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days) or trastuzumab-capecitabine (trastuzumab loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks; capecitabine 2,500 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days). The primary end point was incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: The study was terminated early with 540 enrolled patients (271 received lapatinib-capecitabine, and 269 received trastuzumab-capecitabine). Incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse was 3% (eight of 251 patients) for lapatinib-capecitabine and 5% (12 of 250 patients) for trastuzumab-capecitabine (treatment differences, -1.6%; 95% CI, -2% to 5%; P = .360). PFS and OS were longer with trastuzumab-capecitabine versus lapatinib-capecitabine (hazard ratio [HR] for PFS, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.64; HR for OS, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.64). Serious adverse events were reported in 13% (34 of 269 patients) and 17% (45 of 267 patients) of patients in the lapatinib-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine arms, respectively. Conclusion: CEREBEL is inconclusive for the primary end point, and no difference was detected between lapatinb-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine for the incidence of CNS metastases. A better outcome was observed with trastuzumab-capecitabine in the overall population. However, lapatinib-capecitabine efficacy may have been affected by previous exposure to a trastuzumab regimen and/or when treatment was given as first- or second-line therapy in the metastatic setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: To analyze HER2 status in primary breast cancer (PBC) compared with correspondent metachronous metastases and to investigate whether BC phenotype may be predictive of change in HER2 expression. Methods: HER2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry, silver in situ hybridization (SISH), and FISH, in a series of 137 tumors, building up a tissue microarray to concurrently analyze each single PBC and metastatic (MBC) on the same slide. Results: HER2 status was discordant in 14 cases (10%): 12 negative in PBC and positive in metastases and two positive in PBC and negative in metastases (P = 0.04). These findings were confirmed by a PCR based test termed Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). HER2 status changed in hormone receptor-positive BC more frequently than in negative ones (P = 0.002). In addition, we evaluated HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy number by SISH in the 123 cases with unchanged HER2 status during progression. We found consistent HER2 gene copy number stability in the 100 nonamplified cases. Conversely, of the 23 amplified PBC, 13 (57%) demonstrated a significant increase in the HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy number in their paired metastases (P = 0.01), as defined by SISH (k = 0.54, P < 0.0001) and MLPA. Patients who changed HER2 status from negative to positive, presented significant longer time to progression when treated with trastuzumab compared to those who were untreated (P = 0.04). Conclusion: When feasible, HER2 reassessment in metastatic lesions should be carefully taken into account, especially for metastases coming from primary hormone receptor-positive BC.",

        "abstract": "Background: The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole inhibits estrogen synthesis. Fulvestrant binds and accelerates degradation of estrogen receptors. We hypothesized that these two agents in combination might be more effective than anastrozole alone in patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Postmenopausal women with previously untreated metastatic disease were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 1 mg of anastrozole orally every day (group 1), with crossover to fulvestrant alone strongly encouraged if the disease progressed, or anastrozole and fulvestrant in combination (group 2). Patients were stratified according to prior or no prior receipt of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Fulvestrant was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly thereafter. The primary end point was progression-free survival, with overall survival designated as a prespecified secondary outcome. Results: The median progression-free survival was 13.5 months in group 1 and 15.0 months in group 2 (hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.94; P=0.007 by the log-rank test). The combination therapy was generally more effective than anastrozole alone in all subgroups, with no significant interactions. Overall survival was also longer with combination therapy (median, 41.3 months in group 1 and 47.7 months in group 2; hazard ratio for death, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00; P=0.05 by the log-rank test), despite the fact that 41% of the patients in group 1 crossed over to fulvestrant after progression. Three deaths that were possibly associated with treatment occurred in group 2. The rates of grade 3 to 5 toxic effects did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion: The combination of anastrozole and fulvestrant was superior to anastrozole alone or sequential anastrozole and fulvestrant for the treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast cancer, despite the use of a dose of fulvestrant that was below the current standard.

Methods: In the phase III MONALEESA-2 study ( ), 668 patients were randomized 1:1 to ribociclib (600 mg/day; 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. PROs were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-BR23) questionnaires. Changes from baseline and time to deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were analyzed using linear mixed-effect and stratified Cox regression models, respectively. Exploratory analysis of area-under-the-curve for change from baseline in pain score (AUC-pain) was performed. Results: On-treatment HRQoL scores were consistently maintained from baseline and were similar between arms. A clinically meaningful (> 5 points) reduction in pain score was observed as early as Week 8 and was maintained up to Cycle 15 in the ribociclib arm. A statistically significant increase in mean AUC-pain was also observed in the ribociclib arm. Scores for all other EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 domains were maintained from baseline and were similar between arms. Conclusion: HRQoL was consistently maintained from baseline in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ribociclib plus letrozole and was similar to that observed in the placebo plus letrozole arm. Together with the improved clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile, these PRO results provide additional support for the benefit of ribociclib plus letrozole in this patient population.",

Here, we evaluated duration of response (DoR), tumor shrinkage, PFS by treatment-free interval (TFI), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: Postmenopausal women (N = 668) with HR+ , HER2- ABC and no prior systemic therapy for ABC were randomized to RIB (600 mg/day; 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus LET (2.5 mg/day; continuous) or placebo (PBO) plus LET. Primary end point was PFS; HRQoL was the secondary end point; DoR was exploratory end point and PFS by TFI was post hoc analysis. Results: Of 501 pts with measurable disease and confirmed complete or partial response, median DoR was 26.7 months (95% CI, 24.0-NR) in the RIB arm versus 18.6 months (95% CI, 14.8-23.1) in the PBO arm. At 8 weeks, more pts in the RIB arm (32%) versus the PBO arm (17%) experienced best percentage change ≥ 60%. The average pain reduction was greater in the RIB arm (26%) versus the PBO arm (15%). PFS benefit was seen with RIB vs PBO, irrespective of TFI. Conclusion: RIB plus LET versus PBO plus LET is associated with earlier and more durable tumor response, greater degree of tumor shrinkage and pain reduction, and PFS benefit irrespective of TFI. These data further support RIB plus LET as a first-line treatment option for postmenopausal women with HR+ , HER2- ABC.",

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 95 postmenopausal women with a prior history of stage 0-III breast cancer, who had completed active cancer treatment (including hormonal therapy) were randomly assigned 1:1 to either 3 mg oral melatonin (n = 48) or placebo daily (n = 47) for 4 months. Sleep, mood, and hot flashes were assessed at baseline and 4 months via self-administered questionnaire using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D), and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) hot flash diary, respectively. Eighty-six women (91 %) completed the study and provided pre- and post-questionnaires. At baseline, 52 % of participants reported poor sleep in the month prior to enrollment. Compared to subjects on placebo, subjects randomized to melatonin experienced significantly greater improvements in subjective sleep quality as measured by the PSQI, including domains on sleep quality, daytime dysfunction and total score. For example, the mean change in PSQI score was -0.1 in the placebo group compared to -1.9 in the melatonin group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in measures of depression or hot flashes. Sleep disturbances are common among breast cancer survivors, even after completion of active cancer treatment. This is the first randomized placebo-controlled study among breast cancer survivors to demonstrate that melatonin was associated with an improvement in subjective sleep quality, without any significant adverse effects.",

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has shown potential activity in this subset of patients in small clinical series. Methods: KAMILLA is an ongoing, phase IIIb study of T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer with prior HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Patients received T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks (intravenously) until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or disease progression. Tumor response and clinical outcomes in patients with baseline BM were evaluated in this post hoc, exploratory analysis. The main outcome measures were best overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease lasting ≥6 months) by RECIST v1.1 criteria, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results: Of 2002 treated patients, 398 had baseline BM. In 126 patients with measurable BM, the best overall response rate and clinical benefit rate were 21.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 14.6-29.6] and 42.9% (95% CI 34.1-52.0), respectively. A reduction in the sum of the major diameters of BM ≥30% occurred in 42.9% (95% CI 34.1-52.0), including 49.3% (95% CI 36.9-61.8) of 67 patients without prior radiotherapy to BM. In the 398 patients with baseline BM, median progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.5 (95% CI 5.3-5.6) months and 18.9 (95% CI 17.1-21.3) months, respectively. The adverse event profile was broadly similar in patients with and without baseline BM, although nervous system adverse events were more common in patients with [208 (52.3%)] versus without [701 (43.7%)] baseline BM. Conclusion: This exploratory analysis of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and BM enrolled in a prospective clinical trial shows that T-DM1 is active and well-tolerated in this population. T-DM1 should be explored further in this setting.",

        "abstract": "Background: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) demonstrated significantly improved efficacy over trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in DESTINY-Breast03 (median follow-up, 28 months). We report updated efficacy and safety analyses, including secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints (median follow-up, 41 months) of DESTINY-Breast03. Patients with advanced HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with taxane and trastuzumab were randomized to T-DXd (5.4 mg per kg (261 patients)) or T-DM1 (3.6 mg per kg (263 patients)). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review and was previously reported. The key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Other secondary endpoints included objective response rate, duration of response and PFS (all by investigator assessment) and safety. At data cutoff, 20 November 2023, median PFS by investigator assessment was 29.0 versus 7.2 months (hazard ratio (HR), 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24-0.38), the 36-month PFS rate was 45.7% versus 12.4% and median OS was 52.6 versus 42.7 months (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94) with T-DXd versus T-DM1, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with the previous analyses. No new instances of grade ≥3 interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred (all grade rate, 16.7% (T-DXd) versus 3.4% (T-DM1)). With longer follow-up, T-DXd continued to demonstrate superior efficacy over T-DM1 with a manageable safety profile. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:   .",

The aim of DESTINY-Breast03 was to compare the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab emtansine. Methods: This open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done in 169 study centres in North America, Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. Eligible patients were aged 18 or older, had HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan 5·4 mg/kg or trastuzumab emtansine 3·6 mg/kg, both administered by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by hormone receptor status, previous treatment with pertuzumab, and history of visceral disease, and was managed through an interactive web-based system. Within each stratum, balanced block randomisation was used with a block size of four. Patients and investigators were not masked to the treatment received. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review. The key secondary endpoint was overall survival and this prespecified second overall survival interim analysis reports updated overall survival, efficacy, and safety results. Efficacy analyses were performed using the full analysis set. Safety analyses included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between July 20, 2018, and June 23, 2020, 699 patients were screened for eligibility, 524 of whom were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (n=261) or trastuzumab emtansine (n=263). Median duration of study follow-up was 28·4 months (IQR 22·1-32·9) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 26·5 months (14·5-31·3) with trastuzumab emtansine. Median progression-free survival by blinded independent central review was 28·8 months (95% CI 22·4-37·9) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 6·8 months (5·6-8·2) with trastuzumab emtansine (hazard ratio [HR] 0·33 [95% CI 0·26-0·43]; nominal p<0·0001). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 40·5 months-not estimable), with 72 (28%) overall survival events, in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and was not reached (34·0 months-not estimable), with 97 (37%) overall survival events, in the trastuzumab emtansine group (HR 0·64; 95% CI 0·47-0·87]; p=0·0037). The number of grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab emtansine (145 [56%] patients versus 135 [52%] patients). Adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 39 (15%) patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan and eight (3%) patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine, with no grade 4 or 5 events in either group. Conclusion: Trastuzumab deruxtecan showed a significant improvement in overall survival versus trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, as well as the longest reported median progression-free survival, reaffirming trastuzumab deruxtecan as the standard of care in the second-line setting. A manageable safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan was confirmed with longer treatment duration.",

        "abstract": "Background: This article presents global cancer statistics by world region for the year 2022 based on updated estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7%), followed by colorectal (9.3%), liver (7.8%), female breast (6.9%), and stomach (6.8%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.",

        "abstract": "Background: This study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand antibody, with zoledronic acid (ZA) for delaying or preventing skeletal-related events (SRE) in patients with advanced cancer and bone metastases (excluding breast and prostate) or myeloma. Methods: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, double-dummy design to receive monthly subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg (n = 886) or intravenous ZA 4 mg (dose adjusted for renal impairment; n = 890). Daily supplemental calcium and vitamin D were strongly recommended. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression). Results: Denosumab was noninferior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P = .0007). Although directionally favorable, denosumab was not statistically superior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (P = .03 unadjusted; P = .06 adjusted for multiplicity) or time to first-and-subsequent (multiple) SRE (rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04; P = .14). Overall survival and disease progression were similar between groups. Hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred at similarly low rates in both groups. Acute-phase reactions after the first dose occurred more frequently with ZA, as did renal adverse events and elevations in serum creatinine based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grading. Conclusion: Denosumab was noninferior (trending to superiority) to ZA in preventing or delaying first on-study SRE in patients with advanced cancer metastatic to bone or myeloma. Denosumab represents a potential novel treatment option with the convenience of subcutaneous administration and no requirement for renal monitoring or dose adjustment.",

Methods: To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM). Results: In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.

        "abstract": "Background: Cancer treatment should address female-specific survivorship issues, including the hypoestrogenic- related adverse effects of cancer therapies or of natural menopause in survivors. Systemic and vaginal estrogen are widely used for symptomatic relief of vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and lower urinary tract infections in the general population. However, given that some types of cancer are hormone sensitive, there are safety concerns about the use of local hormone therapy in women who currently have breast cancer or have a history of breast cancer. Nonhormonal approaches are the first-line choices for managing urogenital symptoms or atrophy-related urinary symptoms experienced by women during or after treatment for breast cancer. Among women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who are experiencing urogenital symptoms, vaginal estrogen should be reserved for those patients who are unresponsive to nonhormonal remedies. The decision to use vaginal estrogen may be made in coordination with a woman's oncologist. Additionally, it should be preceded by an informed decision-making and consent process in which the woman has the information and resources to consider the benefits and potential risks of low-dose vaginal estrogen. Data do not show an increased risk of cancer recurrence among women currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer or those with a personal history of breast cancer who use vaginal estrogen to relieve urogenital symptoms.",

Methods: Postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms and sexual disorders were enrolled in a case-control study. Women were treated with vaginal gel (containing 50 μg of estriol) daily for 3 weeks and then twice weekly up to 12 weeks. Determination of vaginal maturation index, evaluation of vaginal pH, and assessment of vaginal atrophy symptoms were carried out. QoL, sexual function, and distress were investigated using the Short Form 36, Female Sexual Function Index, and Female Sexual Distress Scale questionnaires. Changes between baseline and week 12 were assessed. Results: Sixty-eight women were included in the study group, and 42 women were included in the control group. Women on estriol vaginal gel had a significant increase in vaginal maturation index and improvement of vaginal pH compared with baseline (P < 0.05). Mean total Female Sexual Function Index score improved, and Female Sexual Distress Scale score decreased from baseline to follow-up. Results from the Short Form 36 questionnaire showed a significant improvement in the overall index of somatic aspects (P < 0.05). The control group showed no changes from baseline evaluation (P = NS). Conclusion: Estriol vaginal gel (0.005%) therapy significantly improves the trophism of the vaginal mucosa and the sexual health and QoL of naturally postmenopausal women. These results confirm that low doses of vaginal estrogen must be considered as the first choice for the initial treatment of postmenopausal genitourinary symptoms.",

Methods: This was an open-label, bicentric, exploratory, clinical study in 16 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors suffering from vaginal atrophy-induced sexual disorders. Atrophy symptoms were assessed by scoring with an 11-point estimation scale (0 = not at all, 10 = worst imaginable feeling). Sexuality parameters of quality of life and medication adherence were recorded in a patient's diary and in the Female Somatic Sexual Experience Instrument (FSSEI) questionnaire. Patients underwent an initial treatment for 4 weeks (one vaginal tablet of Gynoflor(®) containing 0.03 mg estriol daily), followed by maintenance therapy (three vaginal Gynoflor(®) tablets weekly) for 8 weeks. Results: Vaginal dryness continuously improved from a median score of 8 at entry to a score of 4 at the end of initial therapy, and a median score of 2 at the end of maintenance therapy. Normal sexual activity before breast cancer diagnosis was reported by 14 women (88%). At study entry, only three women (19%) were sexually active. At the end of the Gynoflor(®) regimen, ten women (63%) reported sexual activity, of which seven (44%) reported sexual intercourse. The FSSEI demonstrated a non-significant trend of improvement of parameters related to sexuality. Conclusion: Local vaginal therapy with Gynoflor(®) in breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors reporting atrophic vaginitis could be considered as a useful treatment for the quality of sexual life.",

        "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the effectiveness of a topical vaginal preparation containing hyaluronic acid in controlling signs and symptoms correlated with postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). Methods: A prospective, observational study has been performed at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the Vita Salute San Raffaele University of Milan, Italy. Forty-six (46) consecutive postmenopausal women complaining of genital discomfort due to postmenopausal estrogen lack have been enrolled. All patients have been investigated by the use of the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) and of a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) of symptoms at baseline and one month after the end of the study. The treatment protocol consisted of the administration of a hyaluronic acid-based liquid preparation for vaginal use (Justgin®, Just Pharma, Rome, Italy) three times a week, for a total of 8 weeks. Statistical analysis of VHI and VAS scores has been performed by the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for repeated values, assuming a p-value < 0.05 as significant. Results: Both Vaginal Health Index (VHI) and Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) of genital symptoms showed statistically significant (p < 0.0001) improvements at the end of the study protocol. Patients' degree of satisfaction at the end of treatment was reported as high. Conclusion: Conventional treatment of the postmenopausal syndrome, either in terms of systemic and genital symptoms, is based on hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). The limitations to this approach are represented by the need to discontinue the treatment after some years and the contraindications that some women present about the estrogens. For these reasons, alternative approaches have been recently investigated and indicate promising perspectives. Hyaluronic acid topical approach with a liquid preparation for vaginal use (Justgin®, Just Pharma, Roma, Italy) to control signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women demonstrated significant effectiveness both in terms of objective and subjective improvement.",

        "abstract": "Background: This study was a detailed microscopic analysis of the changes of vaginal microflora characteristics after application of 0.03 mg estriol-lactobacilli combination on the vaginal ecosystem in postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) survivors on aromatase inhibitors (AI) with severe atrophic vaginitis. A total of 16 BC women on AI applied daily one vaginal tablet of Gynoflor® for 28 days followed by a maintenance therapy of three tablets weekly for 8 weeks. During four follow up visits a smear from the upper lateral vaginal wall was analysed by phase contrast microscopy at 400 times magnification in order to classify the lactobacillary grades(LBG), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV), vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC), proportional number of leukocytes and evidence of parabasal cells and epitheliolysis. LBG improved from 81% LBG-III at entry to 88% LBG-I&IIa after 2 weeks of initial therapy, which further improved upon follow up (p < 0.001). Whereas BV was a rare event, AV was frequent and substantially improved during treatment (p < 0.01). While at entry most patients had moderate or severe AV, after maintenance therapy no patient except one had AV. The number of leukocytes dropped dramatically from a score of 1.78 ± 0.70 to 1.06 ± 0.25 which was consistent till the end of the study (p < 0.01). Parabasal cells dropped from a score of 3.4 ± 0.64 at entry to 1.3 ± 0.60 at the final visit (p trend < 0.01). Starting from a low rate of Candida colonisation of 2/14 (14%), a sudden rise to 7/16 (44%) occurred after 2 weeks, to return back to base levels at subsequent visits. The vaginal use of ultra-low dose estriol and lactobacilli results in rapid and enduring improvement of all markers of the vaginal microflora and epithelial vaginal cell quality in women with breast cancer on AI with dyspareunia. Candida may develop soon after its use, but rapidly disappears again upon their prolonged use. Due to its excellent safety profiles and clinical efficacy we recommend this product as first choice in women on AI with severe dyspareunia.",

A total of 144 supposedly postmenopausal women below age 70 years were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive hyaluronic acid vaginal gel (5 g per application) or estriol vaginal cream (0.5 g cream per application = 0.5 mg estriol) every 3 days for a total of ten applications, respectively. Exclusion criteria included vaginal infections, conventional contraindications to estrogens, use of vaginal products other than the investigational compounds, being unmarried, pregnant, or breastfeeding. The aim of the study was to test for non-inferiority of hyaluronic acid vaginal gel compared to estriol vaginal cream. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage (%) improvement in vaginal dryness, with the secondary end points being the percentage (%) improvements in vaginal itching, burning, and dyspareunia. Efficacy was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) (0-10; 0 = absent, 10 = intolerable) at baseline (V0), during telephone contact after the third administration (V1), and at the final visit after the tenth administration (V2). Safety parameters included vaginal pH, endometrial thickness, and a vaginal smear for vaginal microecosystem assessment. Adverse events were recorded according to international guidelines. 133 women completed the study. At baseline, participants' characteristics did not differ significantly. Mean age was 54 years, time since menopause was 5 years on average, and cause of menopause was mostly natural. However, mean menstrual cycle days were also reported, although according to inclusion criteria only postmenopausal women were eligible for the study. At V1, an improvement in vaginal dryness was reported by about 49 % of women using hyaluronic acid vaginal gel, and by 53 % of women using estriol vaginal cream (p = 0.31). At V2, the percentage improvement rates were 84 and 89 % (p = 0.13), respectively. Improvement rates for vaginal itching, burning, and dyspareunia at V2 were about 86, 85, and 57 % for hyaluronic acid vaginal gel, and 82, 87, and 62 % for estriol vaginal cream (p[0.05), respectively. After treatment, vaginal pH was significantly lower in estriol-treated women compared to those having received hyaluronic acid. Endometrial thickness did not differ between groups. In the majority of women, the vaginal microenvironment remained unaffected by treatment. However, the proportion of women whose abnormal vaginal microecological results became normal was higher in women using estriol vaginal cream. Adverse events (suspected to be) related to the investigational compounds were minor and included vaginal infection and genital itching. The authors concluded that hyaluronic acid vaginal gel was not inferior to estriol vaginal cream in women presenting with vaginal dryness. They suggest using hyaluronic acid vaginal gel not only as an alternative treatment to vaginal estrogens, but also to consider its general use in women presenting with vaginal dryness of any cause.",

        "abstract": "Background: Amonafide is a new imide derivative of naphthalic acid. The drug had demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some activity in Phase I trials. The drug is extensively metabolized and detected in plasma and urine. Its toxicity has previously been correlated to the formation of an active metabolite, N-acetyl-amonafide. Amonafide was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) master metastatic breast cancer protocol. CALGB 8642 randomizes previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil, or to immediate treatment with standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil. The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival, toxicity, and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard chemotherapy. This report deals only with amonafide as a Phase II agent. Comparisons with the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil arm will not be addressed. Patients had to have histologically documented measurable breast cancer and a performance status of 0-1. Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was permitted. Patients could not have visceral crisis. Amonafide was given at 300 mg/m2/day i.v. for 5 days, and repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles. Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof. Toxicity was primarily hematological and bimodal: 32% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia; 22% had no leukopenia and 44% had no thrombocytopenia. The response rate was 18%, including one complete response. When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity, there was a 35.7% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 (versus 8.3%, P = 0.08). There was a 50% response if patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 (versus 7.1%, P = <0.01). We conclude that amonafide is somewhat active in previously untreated breast cancer patients. There may be a steep dose-response curve, based on the significant correlation between myelosuppression and response. Rates of responses in patients adequately dosed (i.e., with significant hematotoxicity) with amonafide ranged from 35 to 50%. Further studies will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator phenotyping.",

In this prospective phase II trial, we sought to assess the effect of melatonin on circadian biomarkers, sleep, and quality of life in breast cancer patients. Methods: Thirty-two patients with metastatic breast cancer, receiving hormonal or trastuzumab therapy, took 5 mg of melatonin at bedtime for 2 months. Before starting and after 2 months on melatonin therapy, sleep and circadian rhythmicity were assessed by actigraphy, diurnal patterns of serum cortisol, and the expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was completed for subjective parameters. Results: Bedtime melatonin was associated with a significant improvement in a marker of objective sleep quality, sleep fragmentation and quantity, subjective sleep, fatigue severity, global quality of life, and social and cognitive functioning scales. Morning clock gene expression was increased following bedtime melatonin intake. Melatonin did not affect actigraphy measure of circadian rhythmicity, or the diurnal cortisol pattern. Conclusion: These results invite further investigation of melatonin as a potentially useful therapeutic agent for improving sleep and quality of life in cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Locally advanced breast cancer encompasses a heterogeneous collection of breast neoplasms and constitutes approximately 10%-20% of the newly diagnosed breast cancers. These cancers may have widely different clinical and biological characteristics. Patients with these tumors may be classified as stage IIB, III or IV breast cancer according to the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and End Results Reporting (TNM classification). Multidisciplinary therapy has become the treatment of choice for these patients. Primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by locoregional therapy, either surgery and/or radiotherapy, and postoperative systemic chemotherapy is now an accepted strategy. More than 70% of patients achieve an objective response (including pathological complete remission in 10%-25% of cases), and many patients experience downstaging through primary chemotherapy. Breast conservation is possible in 10%-40% of patients with locally advanced breast cancer; almost all patients initially are rendered disease-free, and long-term local control is achieved in over 70% of these patients. Primary chemotherapy is the initial choice of treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors, but it is unclear what the optimal sequence of subsequent therapies should be, whether one or two local treatment modalities are necessary, and whether any or different postoperative chemotherapy is needed. The efficacy of primary chemotherapy was demonstrated in several large prospective studies in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The natural history of this disease was changed dramatically by the introduction of these combined modality therapies. Five-year disease-free survival rates of 35%-70% are commonly reported, and about 25%-40% of patients will survive beyond 10 years without recurrence. In summary, multidisciplinary therapy that includes primary chemotherapy provides appropriate local control and the possibility of breast conservation therapy; it increases surgical resectability and survival rates in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The role of new innovative therapeutic strategies such as high-dose chemotherapy, with hematopoietic stem cell rescue, new cytotoxic agents and higher dose-intensity therapy is currently under evaluation in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.",

No studies have analyzed the aggressiveness of the care in visceral crisis from luminal mBC patients. The objective of this study was to assess practices in this setting in a university medical oncology department. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients who were managed for luminal mBC between January 2013 and April 2016. The analysis focused on the characteristics of the patients, the modalities of cancer treatment and delays between visceral crisis and death. Results: Thirty-five patients pre-treated with two hormonal therapy lines were enrolled retrospectively. Worse performance status and a higher proportion of severe organ dysfunction for luminal mBC were observed among patients with visceral crisis. Sixty-five percent of patients received cytotoxic treatment. One cycle of chemotherapy was administrated in the majority of patients. Palliative care was performed in 35% of patients. Chemotherapy did not have any significant effect on patient outcome in the present study. The mean time between visceral crisis and death was 4.7 weeks (standard deviation = 1.9). Conclusion: Our study showed that visceral crisis in patients with luminal mBC is a complex problem. We need more comprehension of molecular pathogenesis to visceral crisis disease to propose efficacious treatments for these patients and to identify subgroup of patients who need chemotherapy followed by maintenance endocrine therapy.",

Regulatory agencies have modified bevacizumab treatment indications across different regions. In this study, we perform a meta-analysis of phase III studies aiming to interrogate the magnitude of bevacizumab benefit for the treatment of first-line HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods. Data from studies E2100, AVADO and RIBBON-1 were used to calculate the benefit of bevacizumab in terms of tumor overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities. Combined statistical estimates of hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios were calculated using fixed-effects or random-effects models. Results. A total of 2,695 patients were evaluated. Combining bevacizumab with different chemotherapy backbones resulted in a 30% risk reduction of PFS events (HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.86) and increased ORR (odds ratio 1.81; 95% CI, 1.53-2.14). No OS benefit could be demonstrated (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85-1.06). Bevacizumab significantly increased the incidence of adverse events such as proteinuria, hypertension and cardiovascular events. Conclusions. Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of MBC significantly improved ORR and PFS, but also increased grade 3-4 toxicities. No significant OS advantage was observed.",

Bone metastasis may cause severe pain, fractures, and hypercalcemia, rendering clinical management challenging and substantially reducing the quality of life and overall survival (OS) time of breast cancer patients. Studies have revealed that bone metastasis is related to interactions between tumor cells and the bone microenvironment, and involves complex molecular biological mechanisms, including colonization, osteolytic destruction, and an immunosuppressive bone microenvironment. Agents inhibiting bone metastasis (such as bisphosphate and denosumab) alleviate bone destruction and improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients with bone metastasis. However, the prognosis of these patients remains poor, and the specific biological mechanism of bone metastasis is incompletely understood. Additional basic and clinical studies are urgently needed, to further explore the mechanism of bone metastasis and develop new therapeutic drugs.

However, the incidence of MaBC has been steadily increasing over the past few decades. The risk factors for MaBC include age, black race, family history of breast cancer, genetic mutations, liver cirrhosis, and testicular abnormalities. The majority of patients with MaBC present with painless lumps, and about half of the patients have at least one lymph node involved at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of MaBC models that of female breast cancer (FeBC), but this is mainly due to lack of prospective studies for MaBC patients. The treatment modality includes surgery, adjuvant radiation, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. However, there are some distinct features of MaBC, both clinically and molecularly, that may warrant a different clinical approach. Ongoing multinational effort is required, to conduct clinical trials for MaBC, or the inclusion of MaBC patients in FeBC trials, to help clinicians improve care for MaBC patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although rare, male breast cancer (MBC) remains a substantial cause for morbidity and mortality in men. Based on age frequency distribution, age-specific incidence rate pattern, and prognostic factor profiles, MBC is considered similar to postmenopausal breast cancer (BC). Compared with female BC (FBC), MBC cases are more often hormonal receptor (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor [ER/PR]) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative. Treatment of MBC patients follows the same indications as female postmenopausal with surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy. To date, ER/PR and HER2 status provides baseline predictive information used in selecting optimal adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy and in the selection of therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. HER2 represents a very interesting molecular target and a number of compounds (trastuzumab [Herceptin®; F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland] and lapatinib [Tykerb®, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK]) are currently under clinical evaluation. Particularly, trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody which selectively binds the extracellular domain of HER2, has become an important therapeutic agent for women with HER2-positive (HER2+) BC. Currently, data regarding the use of trastuzumab in MBC patients is limited and only few case reports exist. In all cases, MBC patients received trastuzumab concomitantly with other drugs and no severe toxicity above grade 3 was observed. However, MBC patients that would be candidate for trastuzumab therapy (ie, HER2+/ER+ or HER2+/ER- MBCs) represent only a very small percentage of MBC cases. This is noteworthy, when taking into account that trastuzumab is an important and expensive component of systemic BC therapy. Since there is no data supporting the fact that response to therapy is different for men or women, we concluded that systemic therapy in MBC should be considered on the same basis as for FBC. Particularly in male patients, trastuzumab should be considered exclusively for advanced disease or high-risk HER2+ early BCs. On the other hand, lapatinib (Tykerb), a novel oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, may represent an interesting and promising therapeutic agent for trastuzumab-resistant MBC patients.",

This study investigated the efficacy of oxybutynin vs placebo in decreasing HFs. Methods: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind study, women with and without breast cancer with 28 or more HFs per week, lasting longer than 30 days, who were not candidates for estrogen-based therapy, were assigned to oral oxybutynin (2.5 mg twice a day or 5 mg twice a day) or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the intrapatient change from baseline in weekly HF score between each oxybutynin dose and placebo using a repeated-measures mixed model. Secondary endpoints included changes in weekly HF frequency, HF-related daily interference scale questionnaires, and self-reported symptoms. Results: We enrolled 150 women. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Mean (SD) age was 57 (8.2) years. Two-thirds (65%) were taking tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Patients on both oxybutynin doses reported greater reductions in the weekly HF score (5 mg twice a day: -16.9 [SD 15.6], 2.5 mg twice a day: -10.6 [SD 7.7]), placebo -5.7 (SD 10.2);   < .005 for both oxybutynin doses vs placebo), HF frequency (5 mg twice a day: -7.5 [SD 6.6], 2.5 mg twice a day: -4.8 [SD 3.2], placebo: -2.6 [SD 4.3];   < .003 for both oxybutynin doses vs placebo), and improvement in most HF-related daily interference scale measures and in overall quality of life. Patients on both oxybutynin arms reported more side effects than patients on placebo, particularly dry mouth, difficulty urinating, and abdominal pain. Most side effects were grade 1 or 2. There were no differences in study discontinuation because of adverse effects. Conclusion: Oxybutynin is an effective and relatively well-tolerated treatment option for women with HFs.",

We now report the planned definitive overall survival (OS) results from this joint analysis along with updates on the disease-free survival (DFS) end point. Methods: In all, 4,046 patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were enrolled to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in both trials. The required number of events for the definitive statistical analysis for OS (710 events) was reached in September 2012. Updated analyses of overall DFS and related subgroups were also performed. Results: Median time on study was 8.4 years. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy led to a 37% relative improvement in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.73; P < .001) and an increase in 10-year OS rate from 75.2% to 84%. These results were accompanied by an improvement in DFS of 40% (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.68; P < .001) and increase in 10-year DFS rate from 62.2% to 73.7%. All patient subgroups benefited from addition of this targeted anti-HER2 agent. Conclusion: The addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer results in a substantial and durable improvement in survival as a result of a sustained marked reduction in cancer recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Background: Adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor improves outcomes, as compared with tamoxifen, in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Methods: In two phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane plus ovarian suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for a period of 5 years. Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of the gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. The primary analysis combined data from 4690 patients in the two trials. Results: After a median follow-up of 68 months, disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.1% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 87.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, second invasive cancer, or death, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 0.85; P<0.001). The rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was 92.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, as compared with 88.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.80; P<0.001). With 194 deaths (4.1% of the patients), overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (hazard ratio for death in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.51; P=0.37). Selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported for 30.6% of the patients in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 29.4% of those in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group, with profiles similar to those for postmenopausal women. Conclusion: In premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer, adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression, as compared with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, significantly reduced recurrence.

        "abstract": "Background: Risk of recurrence is the primary consideration in breast cancer adjuvant therapy recommendations. The TEXT (Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial) and SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial) trials investigated adjuvant endocrine therapies for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, testing exemestane plus ovarian function suppression (OFS), tamoxifen plus OFS, and tamoxifen alone. We examined absolute treatment effect across a continuum of recurrence risk to individualize endocrine therapy decision making for premenopausal women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative disease. Methods: The TEXT and SOFT hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative analysis population included 4,891 women. The end point was breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), defined as time from random assignment to first occurrence of invasive locoregional, distant, or contralateral breast cancer. A continuous, composite measure of recurrence risk for each patient was determined from a Cox model incorporating age, nodal status, tumor size and grade, and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 expression levels. Subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot methodology revealed differential treatment effects on 5-year BCFI according to composite risk. Results: SOFT patients who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy experienced absolute improvement of 5% or more in 5-year BCFI with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone, reaching 10% to 15% at intermediate to high composite risk; the benefit of tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone was apparent at the highest composite risk. The SOFT no-chemotherapy cohort-for whom composite risk was lowest on average-did well with all endocrine therapies. For TEXT patients, the benefit of exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS in 5-year BCFI ranged from 5% to 15%; patients not receiving chemotherapy and with lowest composite risk did well with both treatments. Conclusion: Premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease and high recurrence risk, as defined by clinicopathologic characteristics, may experience improvement of 10% to 15% in 5-year BCFI with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone. An improvement of at least 5% may be achieved for women at intermediate risk, and improvement is minimal for those at lowest risk.",

        "abstract": "Background: To update the accelerated partial breast irradiation Consensus Statement published in 2009 and provide guidance on use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for partial breast irradiation in early-stage breast cancer, based on published evidence complemented by expert opinion. Methods: A systematic PubMed search using the same terms as the original Consensus Statement yielded 419 articles; 44 articles were selected. The authors synthesized the published evidence and, through a series of conference calls and e-mails, reached consensus regarding the recommendations. Results: The new recommendations include lowering the age in the \"suitability group\" from 60 to 50 years and in the \"cautionary group\" to 40 years for patients who meet all other elements of suitability (Table 1). Patients with low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ, as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9804 criteria, were categorized in the \"suitable\" group. The task force agreed to maintain the current criteria based on margin status. Recommendations for the use of IORT for breast cancer patients include: counseling patients regarding the higher risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with IORT compared with whole breast irradiation; the need for prospective monitoring of long-term local control and toxicity with low-energy radiograph IORT given limited follow-up; and restriction of IORT to women with invasive cancer considered \"suitable.\" Conclusion: These recommendations will provide updated clinical guidance regarding use of accelerated partial breast irradiation for radiation oncologists and other specialists participating in the care of breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Whole breast irradiation delivered once per day over 3-5 weeks after breast conserving surgery reduces local recurrence with good cosmetic results. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered over 1 week to the tumour bed was developed to provide a more convenient treatment. In this trial, we investigated if external beam APBI was non-inferior to whole breast irradiation. Methods: We did this multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial in 33 cancer centres in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Women aged 40 years or older with ductal carcinoma in situ or node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either external beam APBI (38·5 Gy in ten fractions delivered twice per day over 5-8 days) or whole breast irradiation (42·5 Gy in 16 fractions once per day over 21 days, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions once per day over 35 days). Patients and clinicans were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR), analysed by intention to treat. The trial was designed on the basis of an expected 5 year IBTR rate of 1·5% in the whole breast irradiation group with 85% power to exclude a 1·5% increase in the APBI group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the IBTR hazard ratio (HR) was less than 2·02. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  . Results: Between Feb 7, 2006, and July 15, 2011, we enrolled 2135 women. 1070 were randomly assigned to receive APBI and 1065 were assigned to receive whole breast irradiation. Six patients in the APBI group withdrew before treatment, four more did not receive radiotherapy, and 16 patients received whole breast irradiation. In the whole breast irradiation group, 16 patients withdrew, and two more did not receive radiotherapy. In the APBI group, a further 14 patients were lost to follow-up and nine patients withdrew during the follow-up period. In the whole breast irradiation group, 20 patients were lost to follow-up and 35 withdrew during follow-up. Median follow-up was 8·6 years (IQR 7·3-9·9). The 8-year cumulative rates of IBTR were 3·0% (95% CI 1·9-4·0) in the APBI group and 2·8% (1·8-3·9) in the whole breast irradiation group. The HR for APBI versus whole breast radiation was 1·27 (90% CI 0·84-1·91). Acute radiation toxicity (grade ≥2, within 3 months of radiotherapy start) occurred less frequently in patients treated with APBI (300 [28%] of 1070 patients) than whole breast irradiation (484 [45%] of 1065 patients, p<0·0001). Late radiation toxicity (grade ≥2, later than 3 months) was more common in patients treated with APBI (346 [32%] of 1070 patients) than whole breast irradiation (142 [13%] of 1065 patients; p<0·0001). Adverse cosmesis (defined as fair or poor) was more common in patients treated with APBI than in those treated by whole breast irradiation at 3 years (absolute difference, 11·3%, 95% CI 7·5-15·0), 5 years (16·5%, 12·5-20·4), and 7 years (17·7%, 12·9-22·3). Conclusion: External beam APBI was non-inferior to whole breast irradiation in preventing IBTR. Although less acute toxicity was observed, the regimen used was associated with an increase in moderate late toxicity and adverse cosmesis, which might be related to the twice per day treatment. Other approaches, such as treatment once per day, might not adversely affect cosmesis and should be studied.",

Methods: The primary end point was to determine the 5-year difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) between 30 Gy in 5 once-daily fractions (APBI arm) and 50 Gy in 25 fractions with a tumor bed boost (WBI arm) after breast-conserving surgery. Results: Five hundred twenty patients, more than 90% of whom had characteristics associated with low recurrence risk, were randomly assigned (WBI, n = 260; APBI, n = 260) between 2005 and 2013. Median follow-up was 10.7 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 2.5% (n = 6) in the WBI and 3.7% (n = 9) in the APBI arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.37;   = .40). Overall survival at 10 years was 91.9% in both arms (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.79;   = .86). Breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years was 96.7% in the WBI and 97.8% in the APBI arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.99;   = .45). The APBI arm showed significantly less acute toxicity (  = .0001) and late toxicity (  = .0001) and improved cosmetic outcome as evaluated by both physician (  = .0001) and patient (  = .0001). Conclusion: The 10-year cumulative IBTR incidence in early breast cancer treated with external APBI using IMRT technique in 5 once-daily fractions is low and not different from that after WBI. Acute and late treatment-related toxicity and cosmesis outcomes were significantly in favor of APBI.",

Overall survival was significantly improved with pertuzumab in an interim analysis without the median being reached. We report final prespecified overall survival results with a median follow-up of 50 months. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous chemotherapy or anti-HER2 therapy for their metastatic disease to receive the pertuzumab combination or the placebo combination. The secondary end points of overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, independently assessed duration of response, and safety are reported. Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for patients who crossed over from placebo to pertuzumab after the interim analysis. Results: The median overall survival was 56.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.3 to not reached) in the group receiving the pertuzumab combination, as compared with 40.8 months (95% CI, 35.8 to 48.3) in the group receiving the placebo combination (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; P<0.001), a difference of 15.7 months. This analysis was not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and is therefore conservative. Results of sensitivity analyses after adjustment for crossover were consistent. Median progression-free survival as assessed by investigators improved by 6.3 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.80). Pertuzumab extended the median duration of response by 7.7 months, as independently assessed. Most adverse events occurred during the administration of docetaxel in the two groups, with long-term cardiac safety maintained. Conclusion: In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel, as compared with the addition of placebo, significantly improved the median overall survival to 56.5 months and extended the results of previous analyses showing the efficacy of this drug combination.

This trial compared the effect of thalidomide maintenance and no maintenance on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in MM patients. After intensive or nonintensive induction therapy, 820 newly diagnosed MM patients were randomized to open-label thalidomide maintenance until progression, or no maintenance. Interphase FISH (iFISH) analysis was performed at study entry. Median PFS was significantly longer with thalidomide maintenance (log-rank P < .001). Median OS was similar between regimens (log-rank P = .40). Patients with favorable iFISH showed improved PFS (P = .004) and a trend toward a late survival benefit. Patients with adverse iFISH receiving thalidomide showed no significant PFS benefit and worse OS (P = .009). Effective relapse therapy enhanced survival after progression, translating into a significant OS benefit. Meta-analysis of this and other studies show a significant late OS benefit (P < .001, 7-year difference hazard ratio = 12.3; 95% confidence interval, 5.5-19.0). Thalidomide maintenance significantly improves PFS and can be associated with improved OS. iFISH testing is important in assessing the clinical impact of maintenance therapy.

A final analysis of OS was subsequently planned for when 75% of patients had died. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to fulvestrant 500 mg administered as two 5-mL intramuscular injections on days 0, 14, and 28 and every 28 (±3) days thereafter or fulvestrant 250 mg administered as two 5-mL intramuscular injections (one fulvestrant and one placebo [identical in appearance to study drug]) on days 0, 14 (two placebo injections only), and 28 and every 28 (±3) days thereafter. OS was analyzed using an unadjusted log-rank test. No adjustments were made for multiplicity. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and best response to subsequent therapy were also reported. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: In total, 736 women (median age = 61.0 years) were randomly assigned to fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 362) or 250 mg (n = 374). At the final survival analysis, 554 of 736 (75.3%) patients had died. Median OS was 26.4 months for fulvestrant 500 mg and 22.3 months for 250 mg (hazard ratio = 0.81; 95% confidence interval = 0.69-0.96; nominal P = .02). There were no clinically important differences in SAE profiles between the treatment groups; no clustering of SAEs could be detected in either treatment group. Type of first subsequent therapy and objective responses to first subsequent therapy were well balanced between the two treatment groups. Conclusion: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, fulvestrant 500 mg is associated with a 19% reduction in risk of death and a 4.1-month difference in median OS compared with fulvestrant 250 mg.

Methods: The Fulvestrant First-Line Study Comparing Endocrine Treatments (FIRST) was a phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial. Postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer who had no previous therapy for advanced disease received either fulvestrant 500 mg (days 0, 14, 28, and every 28 days thereafter) or anastrozole 1 mg (daily). The primary end point (clinical benefit rate [72.5% and 67.0%]) and a follow-up analysis (median time to progression [23.4 months and 13.1 months]) have been reported previously for fulvestrant 500 mg and anastrozole, respectively. Subsequently, the protocol was amended to assess OS by unadjusted log-rank test after approximately 65% of patients had died. Treatment effect on OS across several subgroups was examined. Tolerability was evaluated by adverse event monitoring. Results: In total, 205 patients were randomly assigned (fulvestrant 500 mg, n = 102; anastrozole, n = 103). At data cutoff, 61.8% (fulvestrant 500 mg, n = 63) and 71.8% (anastrozole, n = 74) had died.

Treatment effects seemed generally consistent across the subgroups analyzed. No new safety issues were observed. Conclusion: There are several limitations of this OS analysis, including that it was not planned in the original protocol but instead was added after time-to-progression results were analyzed, and that not all patients participated in additional OS follow-up. However, the present results suggest fulvestrant 500 mg extends OS versus anastrozole. This finding now awaits prospective confirmation in the larger phase III FALCON (Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Compared in Hormonal Therapy Naïve Advanced Breast Cancer) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:  ).",

        "abstract": "Background: Despite several studies, the impact of adding platinum on long-term outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been definitively established. We conducted a single-centre randomized phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of adding platinum to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. Methods: Patients with histopathological diagnosis of TNBC without evidence of distant metastases who were planned to be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were randomized to experimental or control arms after stratification by menopausal status (premenopausal or perimenopausal, and postmenopausal) and stage [operable breast cancer (OBC, clinical T1-3, N0-1, M0), and locally advanced breast cancer (LABC, cT4 or N2-3, M0)]. NACT in control arm included paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 once per week for 8 weeks followed by doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (90 mg/m2) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) once every 21 days for 4 cycles while in experimental arm carboplatin (area-under-curve 2) was added once per week for 8 weeks with paclitaxel. After NACT patients received standard surgery for primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (LN) followed by radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), pathological complete response (pCR, absence of invasive cancer from breast and LN), and toxicity. Results: Between April 2010 and January 2020, 720 (355 control, 365 experimental) patients with a median age of 46 (25-69) years [< 50 years, 502 (69.7%), premenopausal 418 (58.2%)], were included in the study, of whom 285 (39.6%) had OBC and 435 (60.4%) had LABC, with a median clinical tumor size of 6.0 (1.2- 20.0) cm. At a median follow-up of 67.6 (18.9-142.2) months, in the experimental and control arms, the 5-year DFS were 70.6% (95% CI 65.7-75.5%) and 64.5% (95% CI 59.4-69.6%), respectively (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02, p=0.073), 5-year OS were 74.0 (95% CI 69.3-78.7%) and 66.7% (95% CI 61.6-71.8%), respectively (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.98, p=0.034), and pCR were 55.2% (95% CI 49.7-69.5%) and 41.5% (95% CI 36.2-47.0%), respectively (p=0.0004). In subgroup analyses, the benefit of carboplatin was confined to patient’s < 50 years, with significant interaction between treatment and age. In women < 50 years of age, in experimental versus control arms, 5-year DFS and OS were 74.5% vs 62.3% (p=0.003, interaction p=0.003) and 76.8% vs 65.7% (p=0.003, interaction p=0.004), respectively. Addition of carboplatin had a significant beneficial impact on OS after adjusting for baseline clinical tumor size and age in a Cox model (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.98, p=0.038). In experimental and control arms, numbers of patients with any grade >/=3 toxicity were 140 (38.5%) and 107/355 (30.14%), respectively, (p=0.02), grade >/=3 neutropenia were 2/364 (0.55%) and 1/355 (0.28%), respectively, grade >/=3 thrombocytopenia were 1/364 (0.27%) and 0 (0%), respectively, and febrile neutropenia were 26/364 (7.14%%) and 18/355 (5.07%), respectively (p=0.25). Conclusion: This study, to our knowledge the largest reported trial of neoadjuvant platinum in TNBC thus far, suggests that addition of carboplatin to sequential taxane-anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in substantial and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free and overall survival in young patients with TNBC and should be the standard of care in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody which binds to extracellular domain II of HER2 distally from trastuzumab, disrupting HER2 dimerization and signaling. Pertuzumab improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival when combined with docetaxel/trastuzumab. We report results of a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and weekly paclitaxel. Methods: Patients (pts) with HER2+ MBC with 0-1 prior treatment (Rx) were eligible. Rx is weekly (w) paclitaxel (80mg/m2), q3w trastuzumab (loading dose 8mg/kg → 6mg/kg), and q3w pertuzumab (flat loading dose 840mg → 420mg). The primary endpoint is PFS at 6 months (mo). Evaluable pts are those who started study Rx and are assessed at 6 mo for PFS, including pts who progressed prior to 6mo. Secondary endpoints include response, safety (including cardiac events), and tolerability. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is monitored by echocardiogram every 3 mo. Cardiac events are defined as symptomatic LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD), non-LVSD cardiac death, or probable cardiac death. Results: As of 1-18-13, 53 pts are enrolled; 36 are evaluable at 6 mo. At 6 mo, 29/36 pts (81%) are progression-free (4 CR, 14 PR and 11 SD); 7 pts progressed. The 6 mo PFS results for all patients will be updated. Median LVEF is 64% at baseline (range 50-72%), 63% at 3 mo (range 50-73%), and 62% at 6 mo (range 49-69%). There are no cardiac events to date. Of the 36 pts, grade 3/4 toxicities include fatigue (3 pts, 8%), peripheral neuropathy (2 pts, 6%), sepsis (1pt, 3%), cellulitis (1pt, 3%), neutropenia (1pt, 3%), and skin ulceration (1pt, 3%). There are no grade 3 diarrhea or febrile neutropenic events in the evaluable pts to date. Conclusion: The preliminary 6-month PFS is 81% (95% CI 67-91%) in evaluable patients. The study is closing to accrual. Treatment is ongoing, with few grade 3/4 toxicities and no signal of increased cardiac toxicity to date.

The PI3Kα-specific inhibitor alpelisib has shown antitumor activity in early studies. Methods: In a randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared alpelisib (at a dose of 300 mg per day) plus fulvestrant (at a dose of 500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, in the cohort with PIK3CA-mutated cancer; progression-free survival was also analyzed in the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer. Secondary end points included overall response and safety. Results: A total of 572 patients underwent randomization, including 341 patients with confirmed tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutations. In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5 to 14.5) in the alpelisib–fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) in the placebo–fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.85; P<0.001); in the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.25; posterior probability of hazard ratio <1.00, 79.4%). Overall response among all the patients in the cohort with PIK3CA-mutated cancer was greater with alpelisib–fulvestrant than with placebo–fulvestrant (26.6% vs. 12.8%); among patients with measurable disease in this cohort, the percentages were 35.7% and 16.2%, respectively. In the overall population, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hyperglycemia (36.6% in the alpelisib–fulvestrant group vs. 0.7% in the placebo–fulvestrant group) and rash (9.9% vs. 0.3%). Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7% of patients in the alpelisib–fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3% of those in the placebo–fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported. The percentages of patients who discontinued alpelisib and placebo owing to adverse events were 25.0% and 4.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously.

GARNET (NCT02715284) is a phase 1 study assessing the antitumor activity and safety of dostarlimab monotherapy in patients with solid tumors. Methods: This multicenter, open-label, single-arm study is being conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and expansion. Here we report on the 2 expansion cohorts that enrolled mismatch repair–deficient/microsatellite instability–high (dMMR/MSI-H) patients. Cohort A1 enrolled patients with advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer (EC), and cohort F enrolled patients with advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H or POLε-hypermutated non-EC solid tumors, mainly gastrointestinal (GI) tumors (99 [93.4%] had GI tumors, including 69 [65.1%] with colorectal cancer). Patients received 500 mg IV of dostarlimab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then 1000 mg IV every 6 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by RECIST v1.1. Here we report ORR and DOR, by individual cohort and as an overall population, in patients with dMMR tumors identified by immunohistochemistry testing. Results: For this interim analysis, an efficacy analysis was performed for the patients who had baseline measurable disease and ≥6 months of follow-up in the study (N = 209). The ORR was 41.6% (95% CI, 34.9%–48.6%) for the combined A1+F dMMR cohorts (Table). Responses were durable, and median DOR has not been reached in either cohort (median follow-up: cohort A1, 16.3 months; cohort F, 12.4 months). A total of 267 patients were included in the safety population (all patients who received ≥1 dose; cohort A1, N = 126; cohort F, N = 141). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were consistent across tumor types. Overall, the most frequently reported any-grade TRAEs were asthenia (13.9%), diarrhea (13.5%), and fatigue (11.2%). The most common grade ≥3 TRAEs were anemia (2.2%), lipase increased (1.9%), alanine aminotransferase increased (1.1%), and diarrhea (1.1%). No deaths were attributed to dostarlimab. Conclusion: Dostarlimab demonstrated durable antitumor activity in patients with dMMR solid tumors, with consistent antitumor activity seen across endometrial and nonendometrial tumor types. The safety profile was manageable, with no new safety signals detected. Most TRAEs were low grade and were similar across cohorts",

Inavolisib plus palbociclib–fulvestrant has shown synergistic activity in preclinical models and promising antitumor activity in early-phase trials. Methods: In a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial, we compared first-line inavolisib (at an oral dose of 9 mg once daily) plus palbociclib–fulvestrant (inavolisib group) with placebo plus palbociclib–fulvestrant (placebo group) in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had had relapse during or within 12 months after the completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator. Results: A total of 161 patients were assigned to the inavolisib group and 164 to the placebo group; the median follow-up was 21.3 months and 21.5 months, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 15.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.3 to 20.5) in the inavolisib group and 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.59; P<0.001). An objective response occurred in 58.4% of the patients in the inavolisib group and in 25.0% of those in the placebo group. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 80.2% in the inavolisib group and 78.4% in the placebo group; grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia, 5.6% and 0%, respectively; grade 3 or 4 stomatitis or mucosal inflammation, 5.6% and 0%; and grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, 3.7% and 0%. No grade 3 or 4 rash was observed. Discontinuation of any trial agent because of adverse events occurred in 6.8% of the patients in the inavolisib group and in 0.6% of those in the placebo group. Conclusion: In patients with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, inavolisib plus palbociclib–fulvestrant led to significantly longer progression-free survival than placebo plus palbociclib–fulvestrant, with a greater incidence of toxic effects.

ML-2 previously reported a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS; primary endpoint) with RIB + LET vs PBO + LET (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.72). We report the protocol-specified final analysis of OS (key secondary endpoint). Methods: Postmenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− ABC were randomized 1:1 to receive RIB + LET or PBO + LET. Pts were excluded if they received a prior CDK4/6i, chemotherapy (CT), or ET in the advanced setting. OS was evaluated with a stratified log-rank test and summarized using Kaplan–Meier methods. This protocol-specified analysis was planned after 400 deaths. Results: The intention-to-treat population included 668 pts (RIB: 334; PBO: 334). At data cutoff (10 June 2021), 47 pts were still on treatment (RIB: 30 [9.0%]; PBO: 17 [5.1%]) and the median follow-up was 79.7 mo (min, 74.6 mo). Final OS was evaluated after 400 deaths (RIB: 181 [54.2%]; PBO: 219 [65.6%]). RIB + LET showed a significant OS benefit vs PBO + LET (median, 63.9 vs 51.4 mo; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.93; P=.004) and met the boundary of statistical significance. Estimated 6-year OS rate was 44.2% for RIB vs 32.0% for PBO.

Meanwhile, the anti-estrogen fulvestrant (F) showed to be superior to anastrozole in the same population (FALCON trial). We aimed to identify the best endocrine agent to combine with P in this first-line scenario.  Methods: A total of 486 pts with ER[+]/HER2[-] MBC with no prior therapy in the advanced setting and endocrine sensitive criteria (relapse > 12 months [mo] after the end of adjuvant endocrine therapy or diagnosed with “de novo” metastatic disease) were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive P (oral 125 mg/day [d]; 3 wks on/1 wk off) plus F 500 mg/d (I.M Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 d) or PL (oral 2.5 mg/d). Pts were stratified by visceral involvement and type of disease presentation (“de novo”/recurrent). Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety. 254 events were needed with 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) ≤0.7 in favor of PF (2-sided α = 0.05). Results: By March 9th, 2020, 256 PFS events occurred. Pts characteristics were well balanced. Median age was 62 years (range: 25–90), 56.6% were ECOG 0, 40.7% had “de novo” metastatic disease, 48% had visceral disease, and 43.6% with ≥3 organ sites involved. At median follow-up of 32 mo, median PFS was 27.9 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2-33.1) with PF and 32.8 mo (95% CI, 25.8-35.9) with PL (HR: 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5; P = 0.321). No differences were observed for pts with or without visceral involvement (HR: 1.3 and HR: 0.97 respectively, interaction P = 0.275), and for “de novo” or recurrent metastatic disease (HR: 1.1 and HR: 1.1 respectively, P = 0.979). The 4-year OS rate was 67.6% in PF and 67.5% in PL arm (HR: 1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.5; P = 0.986). No differences were observed in ORR or CBR between arms. Grade ≥3 adverse events were similar in both arms, being neutropenia and leukopenia the most frequent. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: This study was not able to identify an improvement in PFS for PF over PL in patients with endocrine-sensitive ER[+]/HER2[-] MBC. As both arms demonstrated comparable 4 years-OS, PF is a reasonable alternative to PL in this setting.",

Conclusion: T-DXd demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS vs T-DM1 in pts previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane for HER2+ mBC. These data confirm that T-DXd is tolerable with manageable toxicity and a significant improvement in ILD profile vs studies performed in more heavily pretreated pts. This study will lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of HER2+ mBC.",

        "abstract": "Background: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate with a HER2 antibody, tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker, and a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. DESTINY-Breast01 (NCT03248492) is an open-label, international, multicenter, phase 2 study of T-DXd in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and supported regulatory approval in the US and Japan. Updated longer-term safety and efficacy results are presented here. Methods: All patients were required to have MBC that progressed on or after T-DM1. 253 patients were enrolled and 184 received T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg, representing the primary analysis set. The primary endpoint was ORR. Additional endpoints included duration of response, PFS, and OS. Results: Patients had received a median of 6 previous lines of treatment for MBC. In this updated data cutoff (8 June 2020) compared to the prior data cutoff (1 Aug 2019), median duration of follow-up has increased from 11.1 to 20.5 mo; 37 patients (20.1%) remain on treatment. Confirmed ORR was 61.4% (12 CRs) with a median duration of response of 20.8 mo; the disease control rate was 97.3% (95% CI, 93.8-99.1). The updated mPFS was 19.4 mo (95% CI, 14.1 mo-NE). Estimated OS was 85% (95% CI, 79%-90%) at 12 months and 74% (95% CI, 67%-80%) at 18 months. The preliminary mOS is 24.6 mo (estimated at 35% maturity with only 17 patients at risk at 24 months). The safety profile of T-DXd was similar as that previously reported; with an additional 9 mo follow-up, only 3 new cases of T-DXd-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) were reported. Results are summarized in the table below. Conclusion: Consistent with prior results, T-DXd demonstrated high rates of durable responses in a heavily pretreated population of patients with MBC. From this single-arm, phase 2 study, the PFS and immature OS results are encouraging; these endpoints will be further evaluated in the ongoing randomized controlled studies of T-DXd. For patients who remained on treatment for this longer duration (double that of the previous report), the rate of discontinuation or ILD did not notably increase. Continued attention to pulmonary symptoms and careful monitoring is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Background: A prior interim analysis of KEYNOTE-355 (NCT02819518) showed that first-line pembrolizumab (pembro) + chemotherapy (chemo) significantly improved PFS vs placebo (pbo) + chemo in patients (pts) with metastatic TNBC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) (HR, 0.65, 95% CI, 0.49–0.86; one-sided P=0.0012 [P-value boundary, 0.00411]). We present final results for the dual primary endpoint of OS and other study endpoints. Methods: 847 pts with de novo metastasis or ≥6 mo DFI were randomized 2:1 to pembro + chemo (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine-carboplatin) or pbo + chemo for up to 35 administrations of pembro/pbo or until progression/intolerable toxicity. Pts were stratified by chemo type (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 status (CPS ≥1 or <1) and prior (neo)adjuvant treatment with same-class chemo (yes or no). Dual primary endpoints are PFS (RECIST v1.1 by BICR) and OS in pts with PD-L1+ tumors (CPS ≥10 and ≥1) and all pts (ITT). ORR is a secondary endpoint. AEs were monitored throughout the study and graded per NCI CTCAE v4.0. Results: As of June 15, 2021, median follow-up was 44.1 mo. Pembro + chemo significantly improved OS vs chemo alone in pts with CPS ≥10 tumors (Table). The p-value boundary for a significant OS benefit of pembro + chemo in pts with CPS ≥1 tumors was not met and formal testing in ITT was not performed. The benefit of pembro + chemo on PFS was consistent with the prior results. Pembro + chemo improved ORR in pts with CPS ≥10 tumors. For all endpoints, the pembro treatment effect increased with PD-L1 enrichment. Grade 3-5 treatment-related AE rates were 68.1% with pembro + chemo (2 deaths) vs 66.9% with chemo (0 deaths). Conclusion: Pembro + chemo showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS vs chemo alone in pts with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10).

        "abstract": "Background: Trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2 (Trop-2) is highly expressed in many epithelial tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-Trop-2 antibody coupled to SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan, via a unique hydrolyzable linker that allows for SN-38 release intracellularly and in the tumor microenvironment (bystander effect). Preclinical studies have shown a great range of efficacy with SG in mice bearing tumors with low, moderate, and high Trop-2 expression levels. We report subgroup analyses by Trop-2 expression from ASCENT, a randomized, phase 3 confirmatory study of SG versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Methods: In the global, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 ASCENT study (NCT02574455), 529 patients with mTNBC refractory to or relapsing after at least 2 prior chemotherapies were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 21 days) or single-agent treatment of physician’s choice (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) measured by central independent review per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, duration of response, overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory endpoints included biomarker assessments, including Trop-2 and BRCA1/2. Trop-2 expression was assessed using a validated immunohistochemistry assay. Results: Subgroup analyses by biomarker expression including Trop-2 and BRCA1/2 were performed, and outcomes by PFS, OS, ORR, and safety results will be reported. Conclusion: These analyses will provide further insights into the relationship of Trop-2 expression and the activity of SG in previously treated patients with mTNBC.",

A confirmatory study is needed to clarify the role of axillary treatment in women with ≤2 macrometastases undergoing BCS and groups that were not included in Z11 for example, mastectomy and those with microscopic extranodal invasion. The primary objective of POsitive Sentinel NOde: adjuvant therapy alone versus adjuvant therapy plus Clearance or axillary radiotherapy (POSNOC) is to evaluate whether for women with breast cancer and 1 or 2 macrometastases, adjuvant therapy alone is non-inferior to adjuvant therapy plus axillary treatment, in terms of 5-year axillary recurrence. Methods: POSNOC is a pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority, international trial with participants randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Women are eligible if they have T1/T2, unifocal or multifocal invasive breast cancer, and 1 or 2 macrometastases at sentinel node biopsy, with or without extranodal extension. In the intervention group women receive adjuvant therapy alone, in the standard care group they receive ANC or axillary RT. In both groups women receive adjuvant therapy, according to local guidelines. This includes systemic therapy and, if indicated, RT to breast or chest wall. The UK Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance Group manages the in-built radiotherapy quality assurance programme. Primary endpoint is 5-year axillary recurrence. Secondary outcomes are arm morbidity assessed by Lymphoedema and Breast Cancer Questionnaire and QuickDASH questionnaires; quality of life and anxiety as assessed with FACT B+4 and State/Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, respectively; other oncological outcomes; economic evaluation using EQ-5D-5L. Target sample size is 1900. Primary analysis is per protocol. Recruitment started on 1 August 2014 and as of 9 June 2021, 1866 participants have been randomised.",

        "abstract": "Background: Radiotherapy has become much better targeted since the 1980s, improving both safety and efficacy. In breast cancer, radiotherapy to regional lymph nodes aims to reduce risks of recurrence and death. Its effects have been studied in randomised trials, some before the 1980s and some after. We aimed to assess the effects of regional node radiotherapy in these two eras. Methods: In this meta-analysis of individual patient data, we sought data from all randomised trials of regional lymph node radiotherapy versus no regional lymph node radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer (including one study that irradiated lymph nodes only if the cancer was right-sided). Trials were identified through the EBCTCG's regular systematic searches of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts. Trials were eligible if they began before Jan 1, 2009. The only systematic difference between treatment groups was in regional node radiotherapy (to the internal mammary chain, supraclavicular fossa, or axilla, or any combinations of these). Primary outcomes were recurrence at any site, breast cancer mortality, non-breast-cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. Data were supplied by trialists and standardised into a format suitable for analysis. A summary of the formatted data was returned to trialists for verification. Log-rank analyses yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals. Results: We found 17 eligible trials, 16 of which had available data (for 14 324 participants), and one of which (henceforth excluded), had unavailable data (for 165 participants). In the eight newer trials (12 167 patients), which started during 1989-2008, regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced recurrence (rate ratio 0·88, 95% CI 0·81-0·95; p=0·0008). The main effect was on distant recurrence as few regional node recurrences were reported. Radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality (RR 0·87, 95% CI 0·80-0·94; p=0·0010), with no significant effect on non-breast-cancer mortality (0·97, 0·84-1·11; p=0·63), leading to significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0·90, 0·84-0·96; p=0·0022). In an illustrative calculation, estimated absolute reductions in 15-year breast cancer mortality were 1·6% for women with no positive axillary nodes, 2·7% for those with one to three positive axillary nodes, and 4·5% for those with four or more positive axillary nodes. In the eight older trials (2157 patients), which started during 1961-78, regional node radiotherapy had little effect on breast cancer mortality (RR 1·04, 95% CI 0·91-1·20; p=0·55), but significantly increased non-breast-cancer mortality (1·42, 1·18-1·71; p=0·00023), with risk mainly after year 20, and all-cause mortality (1·17, 1·04-1·31; p=0·0067). Conclusion: Regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in trials done after the 1980s, but not in older trials. These contrasting findings could reflect radiotherapy improvements since the 1980s.",

We have previously reported outcomes of the ABCSG-18 (study 18 from the Austrian Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group) trial showing that adjuvant anti–receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand denosumab treatment counteracts these adverse effects and may improve outcomes. We report here the final long-term outcomes.&#10; Methods: ABCSG-18 is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial in which 3425 postmenopausal patients with early hormone receptor–positive breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy were randomly assigned in 58 trial centers to receive either denosumab 60 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously every 6 months. The primary end point was the time to first clinical fracture after randomization. Secondary disease outcome–related end points were disease-free survival (DFS), bone metastasis–free survival (BMFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: For this final protocol-defined analysis, median follow-up is 8 years (interquartile range, 6 to 9.6 years). There were 309 versus 368 DFS events (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.97) in the denosumab versus the placebo group, respectively, resulting in an absolute 9-year DFS benefit of 3.5 percentage points (79.4 vs. 75.9%). Adjuvant denosumab improved BMFS by 2.5 percentage points (88.9 vs. 86.4%; hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00) and OS by 1.0 percentage point (90.9 vs. 89.9%; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.01). No new toxicities for this dose of adjuvant denosumab were observed. Conclusion: DFS, BMFS, and OS continued to show benefit in this final long-term analysis of ABCSG-18.

        "abstract": "Background: RIB + ET has demonstrated significant survival benefits in pre- and postmenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− metastatic BC. To investigate whether RIB + ET also improves outcomes in early BC (EBC), the Phase III NATALEE trial (NCT03701334) evaluated adjuvant RIB + ET in a broad population of pts with stage II or III HR+/HER2− EBC at risk for recurrence, including pts with no nodal involvement (N0). As extended duration of tx is crucial to prolong cell cycle arrest and drive more tumor cells into senescence or death, a 3-y duration of RIB tx at a dose of 400 mg was chosen to improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy. Results from a prespecified interim analysis of invasive disease–free survival (iDFS; primary endpoint) are presented. Methods: Men and pre- or postmenopausal women were randomized 1:1 to RIB (400 mg/day; 3 wk on/1 wk off for 3 y) + ET (letrozole 2.5 mg/day or anastrozole 1 mg/day, for ≥ 5 y) or ET alone. Men and premenopausal women also received goserelin. Eligible pts had an ECOG PS of 0-1 and BC anatomic stage IIA (either N0 with additional risk factors or 1-3 axillary lymph nodes [N1]), stage IIB, or stage III per AJCC (8th ed); prior (neo)adjuvant ET was allowed if initiated ≤ 12 mo before randomization. Stratification factors were menopausal status, disease stage, prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, and geographic region. This prespecified interim analysis of iDFS, defined per STEEP criteria, was planned after ≈ 425 iDFS events (≈ 85% of planned total events). iDFS was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methods, and statistical comparison was made by a stratified log-rank test, with a protocol-defined Lan-DeMets (O'Brien-Flemming) stopping boundary of a 1-sided P < .0128 for superior efficacy. Results: From 10 Jan 2019 to 20 April 2021, 5101 pts were randomized (RIB+ET, n = 2549; ET alone, n = 2552). As of the data cutoff (11 Jan 2023), median follow-up was 34 mo (min, 21 mo). 3- and 2-y RIB tx was completed by 515 pts (20.2%) and 1449 pts (56.8%), respectively; 3810 (74.7%) remained on study tx (RIB+ET, n = 1984; ET alone, n = 1826). iDFS was evaluated after 426 events (RIB + ET, n = 189; ET alone, n = 237). RIB + ET demonstrated significantly longer iDFS than ET alone (HR, 0.748; 95% CI, 0.618-0.906; P = .0014); 3-y iDFS rates were 90.4% vs 87.1%. iDFS benefit was generally consistent across stratification factors and other subgroups. Secondary endpoints of overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and distant disease–free survival consistently favored RIB. RIB at 400 mg had a favorable safety profile with no new signals. Conclusion:  Ribociclib added to standard-of-care ET demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in iDFS with a well-tolerated safety profile. The NATALEE results support ribociclib + ET as the treatment of choice in a broad population of pts with stage II or III HR+/HER2− EBC, including pts with N0 disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: Trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality. Methods: We did a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials assessing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus the same chemotherapy alone. Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs). Results: Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p<0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p<0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p<0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p<0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p<0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, –0·3 to 1·1; p=0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0–1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2–4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5–9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1–3, and N4+ disease). Conclusion: Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional reductions irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.",

We present the final, protocol-specified analysis of the long-term results from this trial that was initially developed to determine how to maximize adjuvant treatment efficacy and safety in these patients. Methods: Between April, 2001 and March, 2004, we randomized 3,222 HER2+ operable breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node-positive or high risk node-negative disease, to either standard AC (60/600mg/m2 q3wk x 4) followed by T (100mg/m2 q3wk x 4) (AC-T) or two trastuzumab-based regimens. The trastuzumab-based regimens were AC followed by T (100mg/m2 q3wk x 4) and trastuzumab (H) x 1 year (AC-TH), or TCarbo (75mg/m2/AUC6 q3wk x 6) and H x 1 year (TCH). Patients were prospectively stratified by number of positive nodes (0, 1-3 vs ≥4) and hormone receptor status and those with ER and/or PR positive disease received hormone-directed therapy for 5yrs post chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety, with extensive cardiac evaluation (symptomatic events and asymptomatic, sustained LVEF declines). Results: Baseline characteristics of the study population were well balanced in the three study arms. At a median follow-up of 10.3 years, a persistent significant DFS benefit is seen in both trastuzumab-containing arms compared to AC-T with only 10 DFS events separating the two trastuzumab-based regimens: AC-TH (HR=0.70, 95%CI [0.60, 0.83]; p<0.001)) and TCH (HR=0.76, 95% CI [0.65, 0.90]; p<0.001). At this final analysis, the DFS HRs for AC-TH and TCH are closer than those observed in any prior protocol-directed study analyses (at 5 years follow-up the HRs were 0.64 and 0.75 for AC-TH and TCH respectively). Also, an OS benefit was observed in both AC-TH (HR=0.64, 95% CI [0.52, 0.79]; p<0.001)) and TCH (HR=0.76, 95% CI [0.62, 0.93]; p=0.0081). Importantly, TCH has significantly lower symptomatic CHF events by five-fold compared to AC-TH; 21 (2.0%) for AC-TH vs. 4 (0.4%) for TCH; p=0.0005. The AC-T control arm had 8 (0.8%) symptomatic CHF events. The incidence of patients with a relative LVEF decline >10% is doubled in the AC-TH compared to TCH regimens (206 vs 97; p<0.0001). Conclusion: The long-term 10 years final results of the BCIRG 006 trial confirm the significant benefit of trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of HER2+ breast cancers, no significant efficacy difference between AC-TH and TCH as well as a significant symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac safety benefit in the non-anthracycline, TCH trastuzumab-based regimen.",

        "abstract": "Background: From Nov 2011 until Aug2013, the randomized, phase III, double-blind APHINITY trial enrolled 2400 patients with HER2+, operable breast cancer assigned to receive pertuzumab (P) added to adjuvant trastuzumab (T) and chemotherapy and 2405 to receive placebo plus T and chemotherapy. Methods: The primary analysis demonstrated that adding P to T plus chemotherapy statistically significantly improved invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) leading to a new standard of care for high-risk patients. Two pre-specified analyses of overall survival (OS) did not reach statistical significance. We now report the results of the 3rd pre-specified analysis of OS and updated descriptive analyses of IDFS. Results: With 8.4 years of median follow-up (clinical cut-off date 10 Jan 2022) fewer deaths were observed in the P group [168 (7.0%) vs 202 (8.4%)]. Statistical significance (p-value < 0.0060 required) was not reached. The hazard ratio for OS is 0.83 [95% CI 0.68-1.02 (p=0.078)]; 8-year OS are 92.7% vs 92.0% (0.7% difference). Updated IDFS results based on 609 events in the ITT population are: hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.66-0.91]; 8-year IDFS are 88.4% vs 85.8% (2.6% difference), respectively. The difference was due mainly to the reduction in distant (6.2% vs 8.5%) and locoregional (1.3% vs 2.4%) BC relapses. The node positive (N+) cohort continues to derive clear IDFS benefit from the addition of P: hazard ratio 0.72 (95% CI 0.60-0.87). The benefit in terms of 8-year IDFS is 4.9% [86.1% vs 81.2%]. In the N- cohort, the IDFS hazard ratio is 1.01 with >92% of patients being event-free in both arms at 8 years. IDFS benefit of P is seen in both the HR- and HR+ cohorts: IDFS hazard ratio for HR- is 0.82 (95% CI 0.64-1.06). IDFS hazard ratio for HR+ is 0.75 (95 % CI 0.61-0.92). No new cardiac safety concerns emerged. Conclusion: After 8.4 years of median follow-up, no statistically significant difference in OS was found. IDFS benefit of P in HER2+ early BC is maintained, with the benefit continuing in the N+ cohort, regardless of HR status. HR status should not guide P treatment decisions. Continued follow up of patients is needed to determine possible survival benefit and long-term safety of adding adjuvant P to T. The final OS analysis is planned when 640 deaths have occurred.",

        "abstract": "Background: Retrospective analyses suggest that capecitabine may carry superior activity in hormone receptor-positive relative to hormone receptor-negative metastatic breast cancer. This review examined the veracity of that finding and explored whether this differential activity extends to early breast cancer.&#10;&#10; Methods: Search methods: On 4 June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov.&#10;&#10;Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials looking at chemotherapy regimens containing capecitabine alone or in combination with other agents versus a control or similar regimen without capecitabine for treatment of breast cancer at any stage. The primary outcome measure for metastatic and adjuvant trials was overall survival (OS), and for neoadjuvant studies pathological complete response (pCR).&#10;&#10;Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Hazard ratios (HRs) were derived for time-to-event outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, and meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model. Results: We included 26 studies with outcome data by hormone receptor: 12 metastatic studies (n = 4325), 6 neoadjuvant trials (n = 3152), and 8 adjuvant studies (n = 13,457). Capecitabine treatment was added in several different ways across studies. These could be classified as capecitabine alone compared to another treatment, capecitabine substituted for part of the control chemotherapy, and capecitabine added to control chemotherapy. In the metastatic setting, the effect of capecitabine was heterogenous between hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours. For OS, no difference between capecitabine-containing and non-capecitabine-containing regimens was observed for all participants taken together (HR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05; 12 studies, 4325 participants; high-certainty evidence), for those with hormone receptor-positive disease (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 7 studies, 1834 participants; high-certainty evidence), and for those with hormone receptor-negative disease (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 8 studies, 1577 participants; high-certainty evidence). For progression-free survival (PFS), a small improvement was seen for all people (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96; 12 studies, 4325 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This was largely accounted for by a moderate improvement in PFS for inclusion of capecitabine in hormone receptor-positive cancers (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.91; 7 studies, 1594 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to no difference in PFS for hormone receptor-negative cancers (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 7 studies, 1122 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Quality of life was assessed in five studies; in general there did not seem to be differences in global health scores between the two treatment groups at around two years' follow-up. Neoadjuvant studies were highly variable in design, having been undertaken to test various experimental regimens using pathological complete response (pCR) as a surrogate for disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. Across all patients, capecitabine-containing regimens resulted in little difference in pCR in comparison to non-capecitabine-containing regimens (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.33; 6 studies, 3152 participants; high-certainty evidence). By subtype, no difference in pCR was observed for either hormone receptor-positive (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95; 4 studies, 964 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or hormone receptor-negative tumours (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.66; 4 studies, 646 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Four studies with 2460 people reported longer-term outcomes: these investigators detected no difference in either DFS (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; high-certainty evidence) or OS (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; high-certainty evidence). In the adjuvant setting, a modest improvement in OS was observed across all participants (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; 8 studies, 13,547 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and no difference in OS was seen in hormone receptor-positive cancers (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 3 studies, 3683 participants), whereas OS improved in hormone receptor-negative cancers (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89; 5 studies, 3432 participants). No difference in DFS or relapse-free survival (RFS) was observed across all participants (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; 8 studies, 13,457 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). As was observed for OS, no difference in DFS/RFS was seen in hormone receptor-positive cancers (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; 5 studies, 5604 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and improvements in DFS/RFS with inclusion of capecitabine were observed for hormone receptor-negative cancers (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86; 7 studies, 3307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were reported across all three scenarios. When grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia was considered, no difference was seen for capecitabine compared to non-capecitabine regimens in neoadjuvant studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.77; 4 studies, 2890 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a marked reduction was seen for capecitabine in adjuvant studies (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.64; 5 studies, 8086 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was an increase in diarrhoea and hand-foot syndrome in neoadjuvant (diarrhoea: OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.89; 3 studies, 2686 participants; hand-foot syndrome: OR 6.77, 95% CI 4.89 to 9.38; 5 studies, 3021 participants; both moderate-certainty evidence) and adjuvant trials (diarrhoea: OR 2.46, 95% CI 2.01 to 3.01; hand-foot syndrome: OR 13.60, 95% CI 10.65 to 17.37; 8 studies, 11,207 participants; moderate-certainty evidence for both outcomes). Conclusion: In summary, a moderate PFS benefit by including capecitabine was seen only in hormone receptor-positive cancers in metastatic studies. No benefit of capecitabine for pCR was noted overall or in hormone receptor subgroups when included in neoadjuvant therapy. In contrast, the addition of capecitabine in the adjuvant setting led to improved outcomes for OS and DFS in hormone receptor-negative cancer. Future studies should stratify by hormone receptor and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) status to clarify the differential effects of capecitabine in these subgroups across all treatment scenarios, to optimally guide capecitabine inclusion.",

        "abstract": "Background: Despite overall improvements in cancer survival due to earlier diagnosis and better treatment, socio-economically disadvantaged people have lower cancer survival than more advantaged people. We aimed to examine differences in cancer survival by area-level socio-economic disadvantage in Victoria, Australia and assess whether these inequalities varied by year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis and sex. Cases diagnosed with a first primary cancer in 2001–2015 were identified using the Victorian Cancer Registry and followed to the end of 2016. Five-year net survival and the excess risk of death due to a cancer diagnosis were estimated. People living in more disadvantaged areas had lower five-year survival than residents of less disadvantaged regions for 21 of 29 cancer types: head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, anus/anal canal, liver, gallbladder/biliary tract, pancreas, lung, melanoma, connective/soft tissue, female breast, ovary, prostate, kidney, bladder, brain and central nervous system, unknown primary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukemia. The observed lower survival in more deprived regions persisted over time, except head and neck cancer, for which the gap in survival has widened. Socio-economic inequalities in survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis for cancers of connective/soft tissue, bladder and unknown primary. For colorectal cancer, the observed survival disadvantage in lower socio-economic regions was greater for men than for women, while for brain and central nervous system tumours, it was larger for women. Cancer survival is generally lower for residents of more socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Identifying the underlying reasons for these inequalities is important and may help to identify effective interventions to increase survival for underprivileged cancer patients. Results: In this large pooled analysis of data on 758 592 premenopausal women, an inverse association of breast cancer risk with body mass index at 18 through 54 years of age was found, most strongly for body mass index at ages 18 through 24 years. The inverse association was strongest for hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, was evident across the entire distribution of body mass index, and did not materially vary by attained age or other characteristics of women.",

        "abstract": "Background: The association between increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and risk of breast cancer is unique in cancer epidemiology in that a crossover effect exists, with risk reduction before and risk increase after menopause. The inverse association with premenopausal breast cancer risk is poorly characterized but might be important in the understanding of breast cancer causation. Methods: Objective  To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancer risk, in particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer, and tumor characteristics.&#10;&#10;Design, Setting, and Participants  This multicenter analysis used pooled individual-level data from 758 592 premenopausal women from 19 prospective cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer in association with BMI from ages 18 through 54 years using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Median follow-up was 9.3 years (interquartile range, 4.9-13.5 years) per participant, with 13 082 incident cases of breast cancer. Participants were recruited from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013, and data were analyzed from September 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017.&#10;&#10;Exposures  Body mass index at ages 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years.&#10;&#10;Main Outcomes and Measures  Invasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer. Results: Among the 758 592 premenopausal women (median age, 40.6 years; interquartile range, 35.2-45.5 years) included in the analysis, inverse linear associations of BMI with breast cancer risk were found that were stronger for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years (HR per 5 kg/m2 [5.0-U] difference, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80) than for BMI at ages 45 to 54 years (HR per 5.0-U difference, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.91). The inverse associations were observed even among nonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest and lowest BMI categories (BMI≥35.0 vs <17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or between strata of other breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger for estrogen receptor–positive and/or progesterone receptor–positive than for hormone receptor–negative breast cancer for BMI at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18 to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen receptor–positive and progesterone receptor–positive tumors, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs hormone receptor–negative tumors, 0.85 [95% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 years was not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor–negative breast cancer overall. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that increased adiposity is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at a greater magnitude than previously shown and across the entire distribution of BMI. The strongest associations of risk were observed for BMI in early adulthood. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations could have important preventive potential.",

        "abstract": "Background: Women electing to undergo breast reconstruction following mastectomy have increased in frequency. Classically studied healthcare disparities have an influence on whether women undergo reconstruction. This review evaluates these domains, globally, while exploring why they exist.In the USA, women who are young, white, with higher income and education level, private insurance, and those treated at private or academic hospitals are most likely to undergo reconstruction. Women of a minority race or ethnicity, lower socioeconomic group, early education status, and with public or no insurance remain less likely to undergo reconstruction. Breast reconstruction is not commonly available to women in low- and middle-income countries. Results: Disparities in breast reconstruction persist though significant strides have been made in many high-income nations. Internationally, concerted efforts are needed that focus on health literacy education, access to surgical consultations, and an inclusion of breast reconstruction in the breast cancer treatment process.",

However, prognostic impact of RS in N+ disease and importance of Ki67response after short preoperative endocrine therapy (ET) in the context of genomic signatures remainunclear. For the first time, we present survival results from the large prospective phase III WSG-ADAPTHR+/HER- trial combining both static (RS in baseline core biopsy) and dynamic (Ki67 response)biomarkers to optimize adjuvant therapy in luminal EBC. Methods: 5625 pts were registered and 4691 finally treated by ET (n=2356) or CT (n=2335) within ADAPTHR+/HER2-. ET-trial ITT population comprised 2290 pts: n=868 RS0-11, n=1422 RS12-25/ET-response(30% premenopausal, 26% N1). 5y-iDFS was 93.9% (95%-CI: [91.8% to 95.4%]) in RS0-11 and 92.6%(95%-CI: [90.8% to 94.0%]) in RS12-25/ET-responders.

        "abstract": "Background: In patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/premenopausal breast cancer, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs (LHRHas) are used as standard endocrine treatment. Based on previous clinical studies, 1-month formulations are recommended in most breast cancer treatment guidelines, but long-acting formulations facilitate reductions in side effects and patient discomfort caused by frequent administration. However, few efficacy studies have been conducted on 6-month formulations. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 6-month formulations of LHRHas. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2019 and involved premenopausal patients with HR+ breast cancer administered 6-month LHRHas as adjuvant treatment after surgery, and those previously administered chemotherapy or other LHRHa types were excluded. Patients’ estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured before surgery, and their E2 levels were also measured at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months at periodic postsurgical examinations. Results: A total of 228 patients were included, and the median patient age was 44 (range, 25–54) years. The mean serum E2 and FSH levels before surgery were 69.7 (range, 4–683) pg/mL and 7.3 (range, 0.4–88.9) mIU/mL, respectively, whereas the mean serum E2 level monitored at intervals during the 6-month LHRHa administration was 5.5 (range, 4.0–52) pg/mL. No women menstruated during the follow-up period after the LHRHas administration, and the E2 levels were less than 30 pg/mL in all patients except one. Conclusion: The 6-month LHRHa formulation adequately suppressed ovarian function in premenopausal patients with HR+ breast cancer. This indicates that long-acting LHRHas can be effectively used for patient convenience and that there is high compliance with long-term use.",

We report EFS, OS, and second malignancies ≥4 years postsurgery. Methods: Women with untreated stage II/III TNBC were randomized (2:1:1) to A) paclitaxel (P) 80 mg/m2 (weekly, 12 doses) + Cb area under the curve 6 mg/mL (every 3 weeks, 4 cycles) + V 50 mg orally twice a day (PCbV); B) P + Cb + V placebo (PCb); or C) P + Cb/V placebo (P). All patients (pts) then received 4 cycles of doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide every 2–3 weeks. The primary (pCR) and secondary (EFS and OS) endpoints used a fixed testing procedure that ordered PCbV vs P, then PCbV vs PCb. Efficacy was assessed in all randomized pts and safety in all who received ≥1 dose. In primary pCR analyses, PCbV was superior to P but not PCb, so subsequent secondary analyses are descriptive with nominal P values. Results: Overall, 634 pts were randomized to PCbV (n=316), PCb (n=160), and P (n=158). Median follow-up time was 4.5 years. Hazard ratio (HR) for EFS with PCbV vs P was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43‒0.92, P=0.016) and 1.12 (95% CI 0.72‒1.72, P=0.620) for PCbV vs PCb. In post hoc analysis, HR for EFS with PCb vs P was 0.57 (95% CI 0.36‒0.91, P=0.018). Deaths occurred in 38/316 (12%) with PCbV, 16/160 (10%) with PCb, and 22/158 (14%) with P. HR for OS was 0.82 (95% CI 0.48‒1.38, P=0.452) for PCbV vs P, 1.25 (95% CI 0.70−2.24, P=0.455) for PCbV vs PCb, and 0.63 (95% CI 0.33−1.21, P=0.166) for PCb vs P.

Secondary time-to-event endpoints included invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 174 patients were enrolled between June 2016 and September 2017. The pCR rate with durvalumab was 53.4% versus placebo 44.2% (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.80–2.63, unadjusted Wald p = 0.224). Durvalumab effect was seen only in the window cohort (pCR 61.0% versus 41.4%, OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.06–4.64, p = 0.035; interaction p = 0.048). After a median follow-up of 42.2 months, 34 events occurred in 174 patients. 3-year iDFS in pCR vs non pCR was 92.0% vs 71.9% (log-rank p = 0.002). 3-year iDFS was 84.9% with durvalumab vs 76.9% with placebo (HR 0.54, 95%CI 0.27-1.09, stratified log-rank p = 0.0559); 3-year DDFS 91.4% vs 79.5% (HR 0.37, 95%CI 0.15-0.87, p = 0.0148); 3-year OS 95.1% vs 83.1% (HR 0.26, 95%CI 0.09-0.79, p = 0.0076). No difference was seen in iDFS, DDFS and OS between the window and no window cohort. Conclusion: Durvalumab added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC significantly improved long-term outcome despite a small pCR increase and no continuation after surgery. It needs to be questioned whether adjuvant therapy with CPI is needed at all.",

        "abstract": "Background: Adjuvant zoledronate is widely used in patients with early stage breast cancer (EBC), but its optimal duration and dosing interval is still unknown. While a single-dose of zoledronate can improve bone density for many years, a proper evaluation of its effects on breast cancer-related outcomes would require a large trial. In this pilot study we evaluated the feasibility of performing such a trial. Methods: Eligible patients with EBC were randomised to receive either one dose of zoledronate or 7 doses (6-monthly dosing for 3 years). Feasibility was assessed by a combination of primary outcomes including: activation of at least 6 Ontario sites within a year, active participation (i.e. approaching eligible patients for study participation) of at least half of the medical oncologists, and enrolment of at least 100 patients across all sites within 9 months of the sixth site being activated. Results: All 6 sites were activated within 1 year and of 47 medical oncologists, 27 (57%) approached patients. Between November 2018 and April 2020, 211 eligible patients were randomised, 106 (50.2%) to a single dose of zoledronate and 105 (49.8%) to 6-monthly dosing. Baseline characteristics of randomised patients included; median age 59 (range 36–88), ER and/or PR positive (85%), Her2 positive (23%), menopausal status (premenopausal [19%], perimenopausal [6.7%] and postmenopausal [74%]) and 74% received neo/adjuvant chemotherapy.&#10; Conclusion: All study feasibility endpoints were met in this trial comparing alternative schedules for adjuvant zoledronate. We will now seek funding for performing a larger efficacy trial.",

        "abstract": "Background: Women diagnosed with breast cancer at young age often have poorprognoses. Yet, few studies have focused on the prognoses of young men with breast cancer. We therefore used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based data and identified 151 male patients with breast cancer aged <40 years between 1988 and 2012. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the clinical variables among different groups. Kaplan–Meier curves were applied to compare the survival differences. The subgroup variables on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results showed that male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had a significant OS benefit compared with those aged ≥40 years (P < .001). The significant difference of the CSS was not found (P > .05). Compared with the male patients with breast cancer aged ≥40, those aged <40 had significant OS benefit in most subgroups (P < .05). Compared with the female patients with breast cancer aged <40, the male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had worse OS and CSS benefit only in the subgroup with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor positive (P < .05). In conclusion, we demonstrated that young male patients with breast cancer had better OS compared with elder male patients with breast cancer. However, the survival benefit was not found compared with young female patients with breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: The burden of breast cancer has been increasing globally. The epidemiology burden and trends need to be updated. This study aimed to update the burden and trends of breast cancer incidences, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2019, using the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. Methods: The data of incidences, deaths, DALYs, and age-standardized rates were extracted. Estimated annual percentage changes were used to quantify the trends of age-standardized rates. Besides, the population attributable fractions of the risk factors of breast cancer were also estimated. Results: Globally, the incidences of breast cancer increased to 2,002,354 in 2019. High social-development index (SDI) quintiles had the highest incidence cases with a declining trend in age-standardized incidence rate. In 2019, the global deaths and DALYs of breast cancer increased to 700,660 and 20,625,313, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized mortality rates and age-standardized DALY rates declined globally, especially in high and high-middle SDI quintiles. Besides, the trends varied from different regions and countries. The proportion of the patients in the 70+ years age group increased globally. Deaths of breast cancer attributable to high fasting plasma glucose and high body mass index increased globally, and high fasting plasma glucose was the greatest contributor to the global breast cancer deaths. Conclusion: The burden of breast cancer in higher SDI quintiles had gone down while the burden was still on the rise in lower SDI quintiles. It is necessary to appeal to the public to decrease the exposure of the risk factors.&#10;&#10;",

We examined the survival trends of Asian patients with metastatic breast cancer over fifteen years. The impact of changes in patient’s demography, tumor characteristics, tumor burden and treatment on survival trend were examined. Patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer from three hospitals in Malaysia and Singapore (N = 856) were grouped by year of diagnosis: 1996–2000, 2001–2005 and 2006–2010. Step-wise multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the contribution of above-mentioned factors on the survival trend. Proportions of patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer were 10% in 1996–2000, 7% in 2001–2005 and 9% in 2006–2010. Patients in 2006–2010 were significantly older, appeared to have higher disease burden and received more chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and surgery of primary tumor. The three-year relative survival in the above periods were 20·6% (95% CI: 13·9%–28·2%), 28·8% (95% CI: 23·4%–34·2%) and 33·6% (95% CI: 28·8%–38·5%), respectively. Adjustment for treatment considerably attenuated the relative excess risk of mortality in recent years, compared to other factors.

        "abstract": "Background: About 55% of mBC typically categorized as HER2 negative, express low levels of HER2 (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH− by ASCO/CAP 2018 guidelines) with poor outcomes in later lines (Tarantino 2020). T-DXd has shown promising efficacy in HER2-low mBC in a phase 1 study (NCT02564900; Modi 2020). This is the primary report from DESTINY-Breast04 (NCT03734029), the first randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study comparing efficacy and safety of T-DXd vs TPC in pts with HER2-low mBC treated with 1-2 prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Methods: 557 pts with centrally confirmed HER2-low mBC were randomly assigned 2:1 to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg or TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) in pts with hormone receptor–positive (HR+) mBC. Key secondary endpoints (hierarchically tested after the primary endpoint) include PFS by BICR in the full analysis set (FAS; HR+/−) and overall survival (OS) in pts with HR+ mBC and in FAS. Other endpoints were objective response rate, duration of response, safety, and an exploratory analysis of pts with HR− mBC. Results: As of Jan 11, 2022, 373 and 184 pts (88.7% and 88.6% HR+ mBC) were assigned to T-DXd and TPC, respectively. Median follow-up was 18.4 months (mo; 95% CI, 17.9-19.1). Median treatment duration was 8.2 mo (range, 0.2-33.3) with T-DXd and 3.5 mo (range, 0.3-17.6) with TPC. Efficacy results are in the Table. 52.6% of pts with T-DXd vs. 67.4% of pts with TPC had grade (G) ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). With T-DXd, 45 pts (12.1%; 10.0% G1/2, 1.3% G3/4, 0.8% G5) had independently adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease [ILD]/pneumonitis vs. 1 pt (0.6% G1) with TPC. Conclusion: DESTINY-Breast04 is the first phase 3 trial of a HER2-directed therapy in pts with HER2-low mBC to show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in PFS and OS compared to standard-of-care treatment, regardless of HR status, with a generally manageable safety profile.

PALOMA-2 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial in first-line ER+/HER2– ABC that confirmed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with PAL+LET versus PBO+LET (median PFS, 27.6 vs 14.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.46–0.69]; P<0.0001). At the time of the final PFS analysis, OS data were not mature. Herein, we report OS results. Methods: 666 postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2– ABC who had not received prior systemic therapy for advanced disease were randomized 2:1 to receive PAL (125 mg/d orally, 3/1 week schedule) plus LET (2.5 mg/d orally, continuously) or PBO+LET. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS and a key secondary endpoint was OS. Per study design, 390 OS events are required to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio <0.74 at a significance level of 0.025 (1-sided) using a stratified log-rank test. The planned final OS analysis was conducted when the number of events required for the analysis was observed. Results: At data cut-off (November 15, 2021), with a median follow-up of 90 months, 43 patients (pts; 10%) remained on PAL+LET and 5 pts (2%) on PBO+LET. With 405 deaths, median OS (95% CI) was 53.9 months (49.8–60.8) in the PAL+LET arm and 51.2 months (43.7 –58.9) in the PBO+LET arm (hazard ratio, 0.956 [95% CI, 0.777–1.177]; stratified 1-sided P=0.3378). In this OS analysis, a proportion of pts were not available for follow-up (withdrew consent or lost to follow-up) and were censored: 21% in the PBO+LET arm versus 13% in the PAL+LET arm. A posthoc sensitivity analysis excluding these pts resulted in a median OS (95% CI) of 51.6 months (46.9–57.1) with PAL+LET and 44.6 months (37.0–52.3) with PBO+LET (hazard ratio, 0.869 [95% CI, 0.706–1.069]). Of the pts who discontinued study treatment, 81% in the PAL+LET arm and 88% in the PBO+LET arm received post-study systemic therapy; 12% and 27% of pts who discontinued received CDK4/6 inhibitor, respectively. In pts with disease-free interval (DFI) >12 months, median OS (95% CI) was 66.3 months (52.1–79.7) in the PAL+LET arm (n=179) and 47.4 months (37.7–57.0) in the PBO+LET arm (n=93); hazard ratio, 0.728 (95% CI, 0.528-1.005). No new safety findings were observed. Conclusion: PALOMA-2 met its primary endpoint of improving PFS but not the secondary endpoint of OS. Pts receiving PAL+LET had numerically longer OS compared to PBO+LET, but the results were not statistically significant.",

Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetics, and safety. Results: Median PFS was significantly longer in Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole (25.7 months [95% CI, 19.2 months to not estimable] v 13.9 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 22.0 months]; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.87; P = .007).

No Asians had febrile neutropenia. Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events were similar among Asian and non-Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole (10.8% and 9.5%). In Asians, quality of life (QOL) was maintained with no significant differences observed between treatments from baseline in breast cancer–specific QOL and general health status scores. Change from baseline in EuroQol five dimensions index scores was significantly higher with palbociclib plus letrozole (0.013 v –0.069; P = .0132). Geometric mean palbociclib trough concentration values were higher in Asians versus non-Asians (93.8 v 61.7 ng/mL). Conclusion: Consistent with the overall study population, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole significantly improved PFS in Asians. Hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Asians versus non-Asians but manageable with early dose modifications while maintaining QOL.",

Because first-line or second-line treatments, or both, based on chemotherapy and on hormone therapy have been scarcely investigated in head-to-head randomised controlled trials, we aimed to compare these two different approaches.&#10; Methods: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis with a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and online archives of the most relevant international oncology conferences. We included all phase 2 and 3 randomised controlled trials investigating chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies and hormone therapies with or without targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or both, in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017. Additional recently published randomised controlled trials relevant to the topic were also subsequently added. No language restrictions were adopted for our search. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was done to compare hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (the primary outcome), and to compare odds ratios (ORs) for the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (the secondary outcome). All treatments were compared to anastrozole and to palbociclib plus letrozole. This study is registered in the Open Science Framework online public database, registration DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/496VR. Results: We identified 2689 published results and 140 studies (comprising 50 029 patients) were included in the analysis. Palbociclib plus letrozole (HR 0·42; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·25–0·70), ribociclib plus letrozole (0·43; 0·24–0·77), abemaciclib plus anastrozole or letrozole (0·42; 0·23–0·76), palbociclib plus fulvestrant (0·37; 0·23–0·59), ribociclib plus fulvestrant (0·48; 0·31–0·74), abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (0·44; 0·28–0·70), everolimus plus exemestane (0·42; 0·28–0·67), and, in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, alpelisib plus fulvestrant (0·39; 0·22–0·66), and several chemotherapy-based regimens, including anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens, were associated with better progression-free survival than was anastrozole alone. No chemotherapy or hormone therapy regimen was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole for progression-free survival. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was the only clinically relevant regimen that was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (OR 8·95; 95% CrI 1·03–76·92). Conclusion: In the first-line or second-line setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies are better than standard hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Moreover, no chemotherapy regimen with or without targeted therapy is significantly better than CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Our data support treatment guideline recommendations involving the new combinations of hormone therapies plus targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or in both settings, in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.&#10;",

        "abstract": "Background: CDK 4/6i has demonstrated benefit in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in pts with HR+, HER2- MBC when combined with endocrine therapy (ET). While observational data demonstrate a potential benefit of continuing CDK 4/6i and switching ET at progression, no prospective trials have evaluated this approach. We conducted a phase II, multi-center, randomized, trial to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant or exemestane +/- ribociclib in pts with HR+HER2- MBC whose cancer previously progressed on any CDK 4/6i + any ET. Methods: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, men or women with measurable or non-measurable HR+/HER2- MBC whose cancer progressed during CDK 4/6i and ET were randomized 1:1 to fulvestrant or exemestane +/- ribociclib. Pts treated with prior fulvestrant received exemestane as ET in the randomization; if prior exemestane fulvestrant was the ET; if neither, fulvestrant or exemestane was per investigator discretion, though fulvestrant was encouraged. PFS was the primary endpoint, defined as time from randomization to progression of disease or death. A one-sided log-rank test with a sample size of 120 randomized and evaluable pts with a significance level alpha of 2.5%, achieves 80% power to detect an effect size (difference in PFS) of 3 months. Results: Of the 120 randomized evaluable pts, 1 pt was removed due to not taking ET along with ribociclib/placebo. All but 1 pt was female, the median age was 57.0 years, 88 pts (74%) were white, and 21 (17.6%) were Hispanic. For ET, 99 pts received fulvestrant (83%) and 20 pts exemestane (17%). In terms of prior CDK 4/6i, 100 pts previously received palbociclib (84%), 13 pribociclib (11%), 2 abemaciclib (2%), and 4 palbociclib and another CDK 4/6i (3%). There was a statistically significant PFS improvement for pts randomized to fulvestrant or exemestane + ribociclib [median: 5.33 months, 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 3.25–8.12 months] vs. placebo (median: 2.76 months, 95% CI: 2.66–3.25 months): Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37-0.83), p = 0.004. Similar results were seen in the subset of pts treated with fulvestrant, with a median PFS for those randomized to ribociclib (5.29 months) vs. placebo (2.76 months), HR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38-0.91), p = 0.02. At 6 months, 42% were progression-free on the ribociclib arm vs. 24% on placebo. At 12 months, 25% were progression-free on the ribociclib arm vs. 7% on placebo. Additional endpoints will be reported, including overall response rate and safety. Conclusion: In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, there was a significant PFS benefit for pts with HR+/HER2- MBC to switch ET and receive ribociclib after progression on CDK 4/6i",

        "abstract": "Background: Pts with HR+/HER2- mBC are treated with endocrine-based therapy (ET), followed by single-agent chemotherapy (CT), with increasingly shorter durations of benefit. SG is an anti–Trop-2 antibody-drug conjugate approved for triple-negative mBC with ≥2 prior therapies (≥1 in the metastatic setting). In TROPiCS-02 (NCT03901339), SG showed significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit vs TPC in ET resistant HR+/HER2- mBC (HR, 0.66; P<0.001; median 5.5 vs 4.0 mo; Rugo, et al. ASCO 2022). Here, we report the planned TROPiCS-02 OS 2nd interim analysis. Methods: Eligible pts with HR+/HER2- mBC who received prior taxane, ET, CDK4/6 inhibitor, and 2-4 prior CTs were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV d1 and 8, every 21d) or TPC until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was PFS by BICR with key secondary endpoint of OS. Per protocol, OS was analyzed after ∼350 events. In the statistical testing hierarchy, objective response rate (ORR) and pt-reported outcomes are tested sequentially if OS is significant. Results: In total, 543 pts were randomized to receive SG (n=272) vs TPC (n=271). Pts had a median of 3 prior CTs for mBC; 95% had visceral metastases. At data cut-off on July 1, 2022 (median follow-up,12.5 mo), 390 OS events occurred. SG significantly improved OS (median 14.4 vs 11.2 mo; HR, 0.79; P=0.020), ORR, global health status/QoL, and fatigue vs TPC (Table). Safety of SG was consistent with prior reports with no new safety signals identified. Conclusion: SG demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS, and significant improvement in ORR and QoL vs TPC with manageable safety in pts with ET-resistant HR+/HER2- mBC, a population with limited treatment options. These data support the use of SG as a novel therapy for pts with pre-treated HR+/HER2- mBC.&#10;",

The availability of various anti-HER2 therapies, including trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1), has remarkably improved the clinical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC). However, there is a need to optimize treatment within this population, given the wide variability in clinical presentation. Additionally, geographical and socio-economic considerations too need to be taken into account. To clarify and collate evidence pertaining to HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, a panel of medical and clinical oncologists from across India developed representative clinical scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice in the country. This was followed by two meetings wherein each clinical scenario was discussed in detail and relevant evidence appraised. The result of this process is presented in this manuscript as evidence followed by therapeutic recommendations of this panel for management of HER2-positive mBC in the Indian population.",

Results: EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments were evaluable for 335 patients in the ribociclib arm and 337 patients in the placebo arm. Adherence rates at baseline and ⩾1 postbaseline time point were 90% and 83%, respectively. Patients treated with ribociclib + ET had a longer time to deterioration (TTD) ⩾ 10% in global HRQoL {hazard ratio (HR), 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52–0.86]}. TTD ⩾ 10% in global HRQoL was delayed in ribociclib-treated patients without versus with disease progression [HR, 0.31 (95% CI, 0.21–0.48)]. TTD ⩾ 10% in pain was longer with ribociclib + ET than with placebo + ET [HR, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.45–0.92)]. Patients who received a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor experienced similar benefits with ribociclib versus placebo in global HRQoL and pain. Conclusion: HRQoL was maintained longer in patients who received ribociclib + ET versus placebo + ET. These data, combined with previously reported improvements in PFS and OS, support a strong clinical benefit-to-risk ratio with ribociclib-based treatment in pre- and perimenopausal patients with HR+/HER2− ABC.",

This multicenter study analyzed the real-world data of women treated with pyrotinib-based therapy, aiming to describe their characteristics, treatment regimens, and to investigate the clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 141 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled from February 2019 to April 2020. Last follow-up time was February 2021. All patients were treated with pyrotinib-based therapy in 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).&#10;&#10; Results: The median PFS (mPFS) for pyrotinib-based therapy was 12.0 months (95%CI 8.1-17.8) in all patients. Among the patients with liver metastases, mPFS was 8.7 months (95%CI, 6.3-15.4) compared to 12.3 months (95%CI, 8.8-23.3) for patients without liver metastases (P=0.172). In addition, patients receiving pyrotinib-based therapy as their >2 lines treatment had a numerically lower mPFS than those receiving pyrotinib-based therapy as their ≤2 lines treatment [8.4 (95%CI, 5.9-15.4) vs. 15.1 (95%CI, 9.3-22.9) months, P=0.107]. The mPFS was 12.2 months (95%CI, 7.9-18.8) in patients with previous exposure to trastuzumab and 11.8 months (95%CI, 6.8-22.9) in patients without previous exposure to trastuzumab (P=0.732). Moreover, mPFS in patients receiving regimens with and without capecitabine were 15.1 months (95%CI, 10.0-18.8) and 8.4 months (95%CI, 6.7-22.9), respectively (P=0.070). Furthermore, in patients with brain metastases, estimated 6-month PFS rate was 70.0%, and rate at 12 months was 60.0%. Seventy patients with measurable lesions were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 38.6% and disease control rate was 85.7%. The most common adverse event was diarrhea (85.0%).

Pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab (H) and docetaxel (T) is the standard 1L dual anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive mBC. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of dual anti-HER2 regimen of Pyro+H+T (PyroHT) compared with placebo+H+T (HT) in untreated HER2-positive mBC. Methods: Eligible pts were randomized (1:1) to receive oral Pyro (400 mg QD) or placebo, both combined with intravenous H (8 mg/kg in cycle 1 and 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles) and T (75 mg/m2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was PFS per investigator (INV). Data cutoff for this prespecified interim analysis was May 25, 2022. Results: Between May 2019 and Jan 2022, 590 eligible pts from 40 centers were randomized and treated (297 with PyroHT and 293 with HT). Median follow-up was 15.8 mo and 14.9 mo, respectively.

Methods: Postmenopausal women with HER2-positive, HR-positive MBC were recruited in the dose-finding phase Ib trial. A standard 3 + 3 design was used to determine safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination.&#10;&#10; Results: A total of 15 patients were enrolled to three dose combination cohorts (letrozole/pyrotinib/dalpiciclib, level/I: 2.5/400/125 mg, n=5; level/L1: 2.5/400/100 mg, n=6; level/L2: 2.5/320/125 mg, n=4). Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (level/I, n=2; level/L1, n=1) and level/L2 was identified as RP2D.

In breast cancer, immunohistochemical assessment of the proportion of cells staining for the nuclear antigen Ki67 has become the most widely used method for comparing proliferation between tumor samples. Potential uses include prognosis, prediction of relative responsiveness or resistance to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, estimation of residual risk in patients on standard therapy and as a dynamic biomarker of treatment efficacy in samples taken before, during, and after neoadjuvant therapy, particularly neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Increasingly, Ki67 is measured in these scenarios for clinical research, including as a primary efficacy endpoint for clinical trials, and sometimes for clinical management. At present, the enormous variation in analytical practice markedly limits the value of Ki67 in each of these contexts. On March 12, 2010, an international panel of investigators with substantial expertise in the assessment of Ki67 and in the development of biomarker guidelines was convened in London by the cochairs of the Breast International Group and North American Breast Cancer Group Biomarker Working Party to consider evidence for potential applications. Comprehensive recommendations on preanalytical and analytical assessment, and interpretation and scoring of Ki67 were formulated based on current evidence. These recommendations are geared toward achieving a harmonized methodology, create greater between-laboratory and between-study comparability, and allow earlier valid applications of this marker in clinical practice.",

However, randomized evidence in oligometastatic breast cancer (OMBC) are lacking. NRG-BR002, a randomized Phase IIR/III trial, sought to determine the efficacy of SOC ST + MDT (SBRT or SR) as first line treatment of OMBC. Methods:  OMBC pts with ≤ 4 extracranial mets on standard imaging with controlled primary disease were eligible if on first line SOC ST for ≤ 12 months without progression. Pts were randomized (1:1) to ARM 1 – SOC ST (mainly chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, anti-HER2) or ARM 2 – SOC ST with MDT of all mets. Stratification included mets number (1 vs > 1), ER/PR and Her2 status, and chemotherapy use. Phase IIR targeted sample size was 128 total/116 eligible pts, for 92% power and 1-sided significance level = 0.15 to determine if adding MDT shows a signal for improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55, corresponding to median PFS (mPFS) from 10.5 to 19 months), in order to continue to the full phase III trial for OS. PFS and OS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier and arms compared with log-rank. Results: 125 of the 129 pts randomized were eligible (ARM 1 = 65, ARM 2 = 60). Key characteristics included median age 54, 79% ER+ or PR+/HER2-, 13% HER2+, 8% triple negative. 60% had 1 metastasis and 20% presented synchronously with primary disease. Following randomization, systemic therapy was delivered to 95% in ARM 1 and 93% in ARM 2; ablation: SBRT 93%, SR 2%, and 5% none. The median follow-up was 30 mo. The mPFS (70% CI) in ARM 1 was 23 mo (18, 29) and 19.5 mo (17, 36) in ARM 2; 24 and 36-mo PFS (70% CI) for ARM 1 were 45.7% (38.9, 52.5) and 32.8% (26.0, 39.5) compared with 46.8 (39.2, 54.3) and 38.1 (29.7, 46.6) in ARM 2; HR (70% CI): 0.92 (0.71, 1.17); and 1-sided log-rank p = 0.36. As PFS did not show signal, OS reporting is included: median OS was not reached in either arm; 36-mo OS (95% CI) in ARM 1 71.8% (58.9, 84.7) and ARM 2 68.9% (55.1, 82.6; 2-sided log-rank p = 0.54). Analysis of first failure showed new mets outside index area (Arm 1) /RT field (Arm 2) developed similarly in both arms at 40%. There were fewer new mets inside treated/index area for Arm 2 6.7% vs ARM 1 29.2%, respectively. There were no grade 5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), 1 grade 4 AE in ARM 1, and 9.7% and 5.3% grade 3 AEs in ARMS 1 and 2, respectively. Circulating tumor cell counts (0 vs ≥1) at baseline were similar in both arms and were not prognostic HR (95% CI): 1.04 (0.54, 2.02).

        "abstract": "Background: OVERSTEP is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of capecitabine (CAP) versus endocrine therapy (HT) as maintenance therapy after 1st-line CAP-based combination chemotherapy in HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC. At 2020 SABCS conference, we have reported the primary endpoint (progression-free survival, PFS) of the OVERSTEP (NCT02597868) trial. With a median follow-up of 24.3 months,Median PFS (mPFS) of HT cohort was significantly longer than that of CAP group (17.5 months vs. 12.2 months, HR=0.625, 95%CI: 0.429-0.909, P=0.013). In this annual meeting, we will report the update of mPFS and the secondary endpoint (overall survival, OS). Methods: HR+ and HER2- metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients were histologically confirmed and received at least 4 cycles of CAP-based combination regimen as 1st-line salvage chemotherapy. The patients who achieved CR, PR or durable SD by RECIST criteria entered into the maintenance therapy setting (MT), and randomly (1:1 ratio) assigned to either CAP single or HT group. Randomization was done centrally with stratification by endocrine sensitive or resistance and visceral or non-visceral metastasis. The primary endpoint was mPFS, and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), safety, et al. The superiority test was performed in all patients who received at least one dose maintenance therapy. The last follow-up ended in June 30, 2021. The medium follow-up duration was 41.4 months and the OS event was mature. Results: A total of 181 eligible patients were enrolled in this study from Jun 5, 2013 to Jan 14, 2019. After combined chemotherapy, 75.14% (n=136) cases entered into the maintenance therapy setting, and 24.86% case were disease progressed (PD) during combined chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 41.4 months (IQR 21.57-79.23), the update mPFS in HT group remained superior to CAP cohort (17.7 months vs. 12.2 months, P=0.011). In addition, the median maintenance duration of HT group was significantly longer than that of CAP group (13.8 months vs. 7.4 months, P= 0.008). For endocrine sensitive patients, mPFS was greatly prolonged in HT group compared to CAP cohort (29.3 months vs. 14.8 months, HR=0.515, 95%CI: 0.269-0.988, P=0.042). Besides, in non-visceral metastasis patients, median PFS of HT group was 25.3 months which was longer than CAP subgroup 17.0 months (HR=0.54, 95%CI: 0.300-0.972, P=0.037). However, in endocrine resistance patients, there was no significant difference between HT and CAP group (13.6 months vs. 12.0 months, HR=0.791, 95%CI: 0.499-1.253, P=0.314). There was no difference observed between HT and CAP group in visceral involved cases (14.3 months vs. 11.0 months, HR= 0.668, 95%CI: 0.410-1.089, P=0.101). The median OS was 51.7 months (95%CI: 36.614-66.786) in HT cohort and 39.8 months (95%CI:14.083-65.517) in CAP group, respectively (HR=0.882, 95%CI: 0.550-1.414, P=0.600). Conclusion: For HR+ and HER2- MBC, after 1st-line salvage combined chemotherapy, HT maintenance therapy demonstrated sustained better survival benefits than CAP, especially for hormone sensitive or non-visceral involved patients. The primary endpoint of this study was successfully reached and the median OS was prolonged by 11.9-months.",

Methods: Pts with HER2-low or -ultralow, HR+ mBC were randomized 1:1 to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg or TPC. Pts had no prior CT for mBC, with ≥2 lines of ET for mBC, or 1 line of ET for mBC if PD occurred ≤24 months (mo) of adjuvant ET or ≤6 mo of ET+CDK4/6i for mBC. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in HER2-low. Key secondary endpoints were PFS in intent-to-treat (ITT = HER2-low and -ultralow) and overall survival (OS). Other endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Results: As of Mar 18, 2024, 866 pts (HER2-low, n=713; HER2-ultralow, n=153) were randomized; 90.4% had prior CDK4/6i.

MONARCH 3 led to abemaciclib + NSAI approval as initial therapy in postmenopausal pts with HR+, HER2- ABC with significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). Here we report the second interim analysis (IA2) OS results for MONARCH 3, an analysis included in the European Product Label by request of EMA. Methods: MONARCH 3 is a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of NSAI +/- abemaciclib. Detailed study information, including the primary endpoint of PFS are published (Goetz, JCO 2017). OS is a key secondary endpoint and this prespecified OS IA2 (data cut 2 Jul 2021) was scheduled after ∼252 events in the ITT population (80% of planned events for final OS analysis), using a stratified log-rank test and applying a pre-defined error spending strategy to assess significance in both the ITT and the subgroup with visceral disease (sVD). Results: 493 pts were randomized to receive NSAI + abemaciclib (n=328) or placebo (n=165). At IA2, with 70.2 months median follow-up, in the ITT the median OS (mOS) was 67.1 months for abemaciclib + NSAI vs 54.5 months for placebo + NSAI (HR=0.754, 95% CI: 0.584-0.974, 2-sided p=0.0301). In sVD, the mOS was 65.1 months for abemaciclib + NSAI vs 48.8 months for placebo + NSAI (HR=0.708, 95% CI: 0.508-0.985; 2-sided p=0.0392). According to the alpha spending procedure, the critical boundaries for declaring significance in both groups were not met for IA2. Follow-up is ongoing for final OS analysis (expected 2023). Safety data were consistent with the known profile of abemaciclib. Conclusion: In the second interim prespecified overall survival analysis from MONARCH 3, longer OS was observed in both the ITT and sVD (an increase in the median OS by >12 months with the addition of abemaciclib to NSAI), however neither met the threshold for formal statistical significance according to the alpha spend procedure.

        "abstract": "Background: The Phase 2 PARSIFAL study assessed whether fulvestrant (FUL) or letrozole (LET) was the optimal endocrine partner for the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) palbociclib (PAL) in patients (pts) with untreated, endocrine-sensitive, hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in the first-line setting. This trial failed to demonstrate an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of PAL+FUL over PAL+LET (Llombart-Cussac et al. Jama Oncol 2021). Following progression on CDK4/6i-based regimens in the metastatic setting, the EMERALD study (Bardia et al, SABCS 2022 GS3-01) identified early progressions (< 12 months [mo]) as a strong predictor of resistance to subsequent endocrine therapies. Here, we report updated PFS and overall survival (OS) from PARSIFAL, exploring a PFS <12 mo threshold as a prognostic factor for poor outcomes. Methods: This was an observational, international, multicenter study that included pts from the prospective PARSIFAL study, in which pts were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PAL (oral 125 mg/day, 28-day cycles; 3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus FUL or LET at conventional doses. The primary objective was to extend the assessment of OS of PARSIFAL study with a longer median follow-up. Secondary objectives included extended PFS, other post-progression efficacy data, and the identification of new prognostic and predictive markers. The design had a planned recruitment of at least 388 pts with 195 deaths. The 2-sided stratified log-rank test (α = 0.05) had a 70% power to detect a hazard ratio ≤0.70 in favor of FUL + PAL arm. Results: A total of 389 pts (80.5%) from the PARSIFAL study were included in this analysis, involving 32 of the 47 original sites. Pts signed a new informed consent form according to local regulations. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the PARSIFAL-LONG and the overall PARISFAL intention-to-treat populations. At the time of analysis, after a median follow up of 5.0 years (range, 0.1-7.3), 241 and 213 events were reported for PFS and OS, respectively. No differences in efficacy were observed between treatment arms whether for PFS (hazard ratio, 1.0, p=0.985) or OS (hazard ratio, 0.94, p=0.635). In accordance with the protocol for PARSIFAL-LONG, both arms were combined for subsequent analysis. The median PFS (mPFS) for the first-line PAL-based regimen population was 33.2 mo (95%CI, 27.7-39.5), with a median OS (mOS) of 65.4 mo (95%CI, 57.8-72.0). A total of 86 pts (22.1% of the population) had a mPFS time <12 mo (early progressors). mOS and mPFS for this early progressor subgroup were 24.0 mo (95%CI, 17.3-30.1) and 7.0 mo (95%CI, 5.6-8.3), respectively, and only 11 pts (12.8%) were still alive at the time of analysis. The remaining 303 pts (77.9%) were progression-free on PAL-based regimens at 12 mo (PFS≥12). The number of events for PFS and OS at this time were 165 (54.5%) and 138 (45.5%), respectively. mOS from randomization for the PFS≥12 subgroup was 81.5 mo (95%CI, 70.2-not achieved) and the mPFS was 49.8 mo (95%CI, 40.9-59.8). Following progression on PAL-based regimens, the PFS≥12 criteria was a strong predictor for mOS, with 27.0 vs 18.0 mo (hazard ratio, 0.67, 95%CI, 0.51-0.90, p=0.007) for PFS≥12 and early progressors, respectively. These differences may increase in the future, as 54.5% of pts with PFS≥12 are still alive compared to 12.8% of pts with an early progression. Conclusion: Extended follow-up analysis from PARSIFAL study confirms no major differences between LET or FUL when combined with PAL. mPFS and mOS results are consistent with those reported in other first-line trials involving different CDK4/6i. Progression within the first year of first-line CDK4/6i-based regimen for HR+/HER2- ABC pts may be prognostic of less favorable outcomes.",

To further characterize the substantial benefit/risk of the Inavo triplet, we assessed additional clinically relevant efficacy endpoints, detailed safety data of key adverse events (AEs) for Inavo (hyperglycemia [HG], diarrhea, rash, stomatitis), and pt-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: Efficacy endpoints includedtime from randomization to end of next-line treatment (tx; proxy for PFS2) and to first chemotherapy (TTFC). Key AEs were reported by grouped terms. PROs were assessed by PRO-CTCAE, an overall bother item, BPI-SF, and EORTC QLQ-C30. Results: Increases in median “PFS2” (24.0 v 15.1 mo; unstratified hazard ratio: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.42–0.83]) and TTFC (NE v 15.0 mo; unstratified hazard ratio: 0.53 [95% CI, 0.37–0.78]) were observed in the Inavo v Pbo arm (median follow-up: 21.3 mo; Table). Key AEs were mostly G1–2 and had resolved (Table). No key AEs were G4–5. In the Inavo arm, among pts who experienced key AEs (HG, diarrhea, rash, stomatitis), median time to first onset was 7, 15, 29, and 13 days, respectively. The key AEs were managed with standard supportive care and Inavo dose interruptions/reductions. One pt discontinued Inavo due to HG; one, due to stomatitis. Pts receiving Inavo experienced a longer duration of time without worsening pain severity and maintained their day-to-day functioning and health-related quality of life on tx. Most pts in both arms reported levels of selected symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE and overall tx bother as moderate or less, indicating that Inavo does not contribute additional tx burden. Conclusion: Inavo+Palbo+Fulv was associated with sustained benefit beyond disease progression, delaying chemotherapy administration, with manageable safety and tolerability that was reflected in PROs; hence, supporting it as a new standard of care.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Phase III MONALEESA-3 trial (NCT02422615) previously demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS with RIB, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i), plus FUL compared with placebo (PBO) plus FUL as first-line (1L) or second-line (2L) treatment in postmenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− ABC (median, not reached vs 40.0 mo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.92, P =.00455). This analysis was final per the protocol; following the unblinding of the study, pts still on study treatment in the PBO arm were allowed to cross over to the RIB arm. We report an exploratory analysis of OS after an additional median 16.9 mo of follow-up, allowing for further characterization of long-term survival benefits of RIB. Methods: Postmenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− ABC were randomized 2:1 to receive RIB + FUL or PBO + FUL in 1L and 2L settings. Updated OS was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model and summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods. Additional postprogression endpoints such as progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), time to chemotherapy (CT), and CT-free survival were also evaluated and summarized. Results: At the data cutoff (Oct 30, 2020), the median follow-up was 56.3 mo (min, 52.7 mo) and 68 (14.0%) and 21 (8.7%) patients were still on treatment in the RIB vs PBO arms, respectively. With this extended follow-up, RIB + FUL continued to demonstrate an OS benefit vs PBO + FUL (median, 53.7 vs 41.5 mo; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90). RIB + FUL had prolonged OS vs PBO + FUL in the 1L (median, not reached vs 51.8 mo; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.88) and 2L subgroups (median, 39.7 vs 33.7 mo; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-1.04). Subgroup analyses also showed a consistent OS benefit compared with the intent-to-treat (ITT) population for most subgroups. PFS2, time to CT, and CT-free survival for the ITT population favored RIB + FUL (Table). Among pts who discontinued study treatment, 81.9% and 86.4% received a next-line subsequent antineoplastic therapy, while 14.0% and 30.0% received a CDK4/6i as any subsequent line in the RIB vs PBO arms, respectively. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusion: The previously demonstrated robust and clinically meaningful OS benefit with RIB + FUL compared with PBO + FUL was maintained after almost 5 years of follow-up in postmenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− ABC. The OS benefit of RIB was observed in the 1L and 2L subgroups, which further supports the use of RIB in these populations. The results also demonstrated a significant delay in the use of subsequent CT with RIB vs PBO",

Here, we report the results from an OS analysis with a longer median follow-up of 73.3 mo. Methods: A total of 521 patients (pts) with HR+/HER2– ABC who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy were randomized 2:1 to PAL (125 mg/d orally, 3/1 week schedule) + FUL (500 mg intramuscular injection) or PBO+FUL. Investigator-assessed PFS was the primary endpoint; OS was a key secondary endpoint. An ad hoc OS analysis was performed when 393 events (75% of the total population) were observed. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis was conducted among pts who consented for this study. Results: Improvement in OS continues to be observed with longer follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 0.806 (95% CI, 0.654–0.994; 1-sided nominal P=0.0221). The 5-year OS rate was 23.3% (95% CI, 18.7–28.2) with PAL+FUL and 16.8% (95% CI, 11.2–23.3) with PBO+FUL. Favorable OS with PAL+FUL vs PBO+FUL was observed in most subgroups except among pts who were endocrine resistant or had prior chemotherapy for ABC. No new safety signals were identified. Eighteen pts remain on study treatment, including 15 (4.3%) on PAL+FUL and 3 (1.7%) on PBO+FUL. A post-study cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor was received by 20 pts (7.5%) in the PAL+FUL arm and 32 pts (22.2%) in the PBO+FUL arm. ctDNA analyses of tumor mutation profiles (ie, ESR1, PIK3CA, RB1) at the end of treatment and their effect on OS will also be presented.

Here we evaluated dalpiciclib with fulvestrant in ABC. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients (pts) with HR+/HER2− locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed on previous endocrine therapy were enrolled. Eligible pts were randomized 2:1 to receive dalpiciclib (dalp; 150 mg po qd, d1-21, q4w) or placebo (PBO) with fulvestrant (fulv; 500 mg im, cycle 1 d1, d15, then d1 q4w). The primary endpoint was investigator (INV)-assessed PFS. As of Nov. 15, 2020, 162 (71.4% of total projected) events of disease progression or death had occurred and a preplanned interim analysis was done. The corresponding superiority boundary was 1-sided P = 0.0080 (Lan-DeMets [O’Brien-Fleming] boundary). Results: Overall, 361 pts were randomized to receive dalp-fulv (n = 241) or PBO-fulv (n = 120). With a median follow-up of 10.5 mo, dalp-fulv significantly improved INV-assessed PFS versus PBO-fulv (median, 15.7 [95% CI 11.1-NR] vs 7.2 [95% CI 5.6-9.2] mo; HR, 0.42 [95% CI 0.31-0.58]; P < 0.0001). PFS per IRC were consistent with INV assessment (Table). The benefit of dalpiciclib extended beyond initial study treatment based on time to first subsequent chemotherapy (TFSCT; HR, 0.47 [95% CI 0.32-0.69]; P < 0.0001). OS data were not mature with a total of 25 deaths documented. Median duration of exposure was 9.4 (IQR, 4.3-11.4) mo with dalpiciclib and 9.9 (4.7-11.9) mo with fulvestrant in the dalp-fulv group and was 6.1 (3.7-11.0) mo with fulvestrant in the PBO-fulv group. The most common (incidence ≥3%) grade 3 or 4 AEs with dalp-fulv were neutropenia (84.2%; vs 0% with PBO-fulv) and leukopenia (62.1%; vs 0%). Treatment discontinuation due to AE was reported for 2.5% of pts with dalp-fulv vs 3.3% with PBO-fulv. The incidence of SAE was 5.8% with dalp-fulv vs 6.7% with PBO-fulv. Conclusion: The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant significantly improved PFS versus placebo plus fulvestrant, with a manageable safety profile.

This phase III study (BRIGHT-2, NCT05077449) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bireociclib plus fulvestrant in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) that progressed on or after previous ET. Methods: BRIGHT-2 study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, phase 3 trial in patients with HR+/HER2- ABC who had progressed on or after prior ET. Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Bireociclib (360 mg po bid) or placebo with fulvestrant (500 mg im, cycle1 d1, d15, then d1) on each 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was PFS based on investigator’s assessment per RECIST v1.1. The interim analysis was conducted when 70% PFS events occurred. Results: A total of 305 Chinese female patients were randomly allocated to receive Bireociclib plus fulvestrant (BF, n = 204) or placebo plus fulvestrant (F, n = 101). 208 (68.2%) patients had visceral metastases, 78 (25.6%) patients with primary resistance to ET and 73 (23.9%) patients had received chemotherapy in metastatic setting. As of March 28, 2023, with a median follow-up of 8.7 mo, BF significantly prolonged the PFS per investigator with 12.94 (95%CI, 11.07-NR) mo compared to 7.29 (95%CI, 5.45-11.04) mo in the F group (HR, 0.561; 95%CI, 0.393-0.799; P= 0.0012). The median PFS assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) were no-reached (95%CI, NR-NR) in BF group and 7.46 (95%CI, 5.49-NR) mo in F group (HR, 0.461; 95%CI, 0.312-0.683; P<0.0001) which were consistent with the investigator’s assessment. The subgroup analyses revealed that in BF group, PFS was improved compared across all subgroups with HRs < 1. For patients with primary resistance to ET, with liver metastases and with bone-only metastases, the HRs were 0.254 (95%CI: 0.128-0.503), 0.381 (95%CI: 0.226-0.644) and 0.234 (95%CI: 0.070-0.787) respectively. In BF group, the most common TEAEs were diarrhea [92.6% (all grades); 5.4% (≥grade 3)], neutropenia [87.3%; 31.4%], leukocytopenia [83.3%; 18.6%] and anemia [66.7%; 10.8%]. Most of AEs were grade 1 or grade 2 and could be alleviated or cured by dose adjustment or symptomatic treatment. Treatment discontinuation due to TEAE was reported in 3 (1.5%) patients with BF.

        "abstract": "Background: CDK 4/6i has demonstrated benefit in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in pts with HR+, HER2- MBC when combined with endocrine therapy (ET). While observational data demonstrate a potential benefit of continuing CDK 4/6i and switching ET at progression, no prospective trials have evaluated this approach. We conducted a phase II, multi-center, randomized, trial to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant or exemestane +/- ribociclib in pts with HR+HER2- MBC whose cancer previously progressed on any CDK 4/6i + any ET. Methods: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, men or women with measurable or non-measurable HR+/HER2- MBC whose cancer progressed during CDK 4/6i and ET were randomized 1:1 to fulvestrant or exemestane +/- ribociclib. Pts treated with prior fulvestrant received exemestane as ET in the randomization; if prior exemestane fulvestrant was the ET; if neither, fulvestrant or exemestane was per investigator discretion, though fulvestrant was encouraged. PFS was the primary endpoint, defined as time from randomization to progression of disease or death. A one-sided log-rank test with a sample size of 120 randomized and evaluable pts with a significance level alpha of 2.5%, achieves 80% power to detect an effect size (difference in PFS) of 3 months. Results: Of the 120 randomized evaluable pts, 1 pt was removed due to not taking ET along with ribociclib/placebo. All but 1 pt was female, the median age was 57.0 years, 88 pts (74%) were white, and 21 (17.6%) were Hispanic. For ET, 99 pts received fulvestrant (83%) and 20 pts exemestane (17%). In terms of prior CDK 4/6i, 100 pts previously received palbociclib (84%), 13 pribociclib (11%), 2 abemaciclib (2%), and 4 palbociclib and another CDK 4/6i (3%).

        "abstract": "Background: The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) + endocrine therapy (ET) is the standard first line treatment for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC). While disease progression occurs in nearly all patients (pts) with ABC, the optimal treatment for pts who experience progression on a CDK4/6i + ET remains uncertain. Real-world evidence suggests that use of abemaciclib after disease progression on a prior CDK4/6i prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) in ABC; however, Phase 2 trials with other CDK4/6i have generated mixed results. Here we present the primary outcome analysis for the Phase 3 postMONARCH trial (NCT05169567) of fulvestrant + abemaciclib or placebo in pts with HR+, HER2- ABC following disease progression on prior CDK4/6i + ET. Methods: postMONARCH was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with pts randomized 1:1 to abemaciclib + fulvestrant or placebo + fulvestrant. Eligible pts had disease progression on a CDK4/6i + AI as initial therapy for ABC or relapse on/after a CDK4/6i + ET as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer. No other prior treatment for ABC was permitted. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS; secondary endpoints included PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7, the study had ~80% power to detect superiority for abemaciclib, with a cumulative 2-sided type I error of 0.05. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS curves and treatment effect was estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. Results: A total of 368 pts were randomized to abemaciclib + fulvestrant (n = 182) or placebo + fulvestrant (n= 186). Most pts (99%) enrolled directly after CDK4/6i + ET as initial therapy for ABC. Prior CDK4/6i was 59% palbociclib, 33% ribociclib, and 8% abemaciclib. At interim analysis, the study reached the pre-specified criteria for significantly improved investigator-assessed PFS with abemaciclib + fulvestrant compared to placebo + fulvestrant (169 events, HR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.48 – 0.91; p = 0.01). At primary analysis (258 events), the HR was 0.73 (95% CI 0.57 – 0.95), with PFS rates at 6 months of 50% vs 37% for the abemaciclib and placebo arms, respectively. Consistent effect was seen across major clinical and genomic subgroups, including pts with baseline ESR1 or PIK3CA mutations. ORR was improved with abemaciclib compared to placebo (17% vs 7%, respectively, in pts with measurable disease). PFS according to BICR was also improved with HR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.39 - 0.77).

Camizestrant demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit vs F in progression-free survival (PFS) in the overall study population (Oliveira M et al. SABCS 2022 Annual Meeting. Abstract GS3-02.). Methods: Baseline circulating tumour DNA was collected at screening and/or Cycle 1 Day 1 and analysed by next-generation sequencing. A post hoc exploratory analysis compared investigator assessed PFS with camizestrant (data from 75 and 150 mg combined) vs F in patients with detectable baseline ESR1 (the gene that encodes ERα) hotspot mutations (ESR1m). Patients were divided into subgroups based on whether 1 or >1 ESR1m variants were detected, the specific ESR1m, and whether mutations were detected in BRCA1/2 or the MAPK pathway. The most prevalent mutations are presented. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare PFS. Results: 48/147 (32.7%) patients treated with camizestrant and 35/73 (47.9%) treated with F had a detectable ESR1m in at least 1 baseline sample. ESR1m were detected in 6/9 (67%) patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation and 5/26 (19%) with a MAPK pathway alteration; however, the numbers were too small to analyse efficacy in these subgroups. Conclusion: Camizestrant showed improved outcome vs F in patients with a detectable ESR1m at baseline and in the subgroups tested. The greatest median PFS improvement was seen in patients where a single ESR1m variant was detected, suggesting that early intervention upon detection of an ESR1m may provide the maximum patient benefit for camizestrant, a hypothesis that is being tested in the SERENA-6 clinical trial (NCT04964934).",

        "abstract": "Background: Combination chemotherapy (CT) remains a standard of care in advanced breast cancer (ABC) with aggressive disease features (rapidly progressing or highly symptomatic disease, including life-threatening visceral crisis). To date, no data have been published on a head-to-head comparison of CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) + endocrine therapy (ET) vs combination CT in this patient (pt) population. RIGHT Choice, a randomized, open-label, multi-national, Phase II trial, investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ribociclib (RIB) + ET vs combination CT in pre/perimenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− ABC with aggressive disease (where combination CT is clinically indicated by physician’s judgment). Here we report the results of the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) and key secondary endpoints from this study. Methods: Pre/perimenopausal pts with HR+/HER2− ABC (>10% estrogen receptor–positive [ER+]) and no prior systemic therapy for ABC were randomized 1:1 to receive either RIB (600 mg daily, 3 weeks on/1 week off) with letrozole/anastrozole + goserelin or investigator’s choice of CT (docetaxel + capecitabine, paclitaxel + gemcitabine, or capecitabine + vinorelbine). Randomization was stratified by presence of liver metastases and whether the disease-free interval (duration from date of complete tumor resection for primary breast cancer lesion to the date of documented disease recurrence) was less than two years. Pts included in the trial had ABC not amenable to curative therapy for which combination CT was clinically indicated by physician’s judgment (i.e., symptomatic visceral metastases, rapid progression of disease or impending visceral compromise, or markedly symptomatic non-visceral disease). Median PFS (mPFS) and median time to treatment failure (mTTF) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Overall response rate (ORR) was also analyzed, with quality of life and biomarker analyses planned. RIGHT Choice is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03839823). Results: A total of 222 pts (112 RIB + ET; 110 CT) were enrolled from Feb 2019 to Nov 2021. Pts with symptomatic visceral metastases (n=150; 67.6%), rapid disease progression (n=41; 18.5%), and markedly symptomatic non-visceral metastases (n=31; 14.0%) were included. Overall, 116 pts (52.3%) had visceral crisis based on guideline definitions. A majority of pts (n=190; 85.6%) had tumors that were ≥50% ER+. At data cutoff (Apr 12, 2022), median follow-up was 24.1 mo; 45.5% and 23.6% of pts remained on treatment in the RIB + ET arm and combination CT arm, respectively. The primary endpoint was met, with a statistically significant PFS benefit of ≈1 year for RIB + ET vs combination CT (mPFS, 24.0 vs 12.3 mo; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.79; P=.0007). OS data were immature at data cutoff. The mTTF was ≈10 mo longer for RIB + ET vs CT (18.6 vs 8.5 mo; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32-0.63). The ORR was similar for RIB + ET vs CT (65.2% vs 60.0%). No new safety signals were observed in pts on RIB. Lower rates of treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs; 1.8% vs 8.0%) and lower rates of discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs (7.1% vs 23.0%) were seen with RIB + ET vs CT, respectively. AEs observed with combination CT were consistent with the published data. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit with RIB + ET over combination CT in the first-line pre/perimenopausal pt population with aggressive HR+/HER2− ABC disease. This is the first study comparing a CDK4/6i + ET vs combination CT and demonstrating the superiority of RIB + ET in aggressive HR+/HER2− ABC. This evidence supports RIB+ ET use as a preferred option for this pt population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pyrotinib (an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting EGFR, HER2 and HER4) plus capecitabine significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with that for lapatinib plus capecitabine in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after treatment with trastuzumab and taxanes in the interim analysis of the PHOEBE trial (NCT03080805; Xu et al. Lancet Oncology, 2021). In this report, we present an updated analysis of the overall survival data from this trial. Methods: This PHOEBE trial enrolled patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received prior trastuzumab and taxanes and up to two prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral pyrotinib 400 mg or lapatinib 1250 mg once daily, combined with oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m² twice daily on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Stratification factors were hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]- and/or progesterone receptor [PR]-positive vs. ER- and PR-negative) and previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (≤1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by masked independent central review. Data cutoff for the updated overall survival analysis was March 31, 2021. Results: Between July 31, 2017 and October 30, 2018, 267 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized to either pyrotinib plus capecitabine (pyrotinib group) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (lapatinib group). 134 patients in pyrotinib group and 132 in lapatinib group started the assigned treatment. At data cutoff, the median follow-up duration was 33.2 months (95% CI 31.4-34.2) in the pyrotinib group and 31.8 months (95% CI 31.2-34.1) in the lapatinib group. 78 (58.2%) patients in the pyrotinib group and 98 (74.2%) patients in the lapatinib group received post-discontinuation therapy, with trastuzumab (60 [44.8%] in the pyrotinib group and 65 [49.2%] in the lapatinib group) being the most common. As of data cutoff date, 54 (40.3%) of 134 patients randomly assigned to the pyrotinib group and 69 (52.3%) of the 132 patients randomly assigned to lapatinib group had died. Median OS was not reached (95% CI 34.0-not reached) in the pyrotinib group and 26.9 months (22.4-not reached) in the lapatinib group (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.48-0.98]; P=0.019). Kaplan-Meier estimated OS at 24 months was 66.6% (95% CI 57.7-74.0) and 58.8% (95% CI 49.7-66.7), respectively. 99 (73.9%) patients in the pyrotinib group and 121 (91.7%) in the lapatinib group had disease progression or had died. Pyrotinib plus capecitabine significantly improved PFS assessed by investigator compared with that for lapatinib plus capecitabine (12.5 months [95% CI 9.8-13.8] vs 5.6 months [95% CI 5.5-7.0]; HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.37-0.63]; P<0.0001). The benefits of pyrotinib plus capecitabine were observed in most clinically relevant subgroups for the updated analysis of both OS and PFS (Table 1). Conclusion: With extended follow-up, pyrotinib plus capecitabine demonstrated statistically significant OS improvement compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after trastuzumab and chemotherapy. This updated analysis of overall survival in the PHOEBE trial reaffirmed pyrotinib plus capecitabine as an established treatment option in this patient population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tucatinib is a highly selective HER2-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for previously treated HER2+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC). Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate approved to treat HER2+ LA/MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. This is the first report of HER2CLIMB-02 (NCT03975647), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of tucatinib combined with T-DM1 in patients with previously treated HER2+ LA/MBC. Methods: Eligible patients had HER2+ LA/MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane in any setting with ECOG performance status ≤1 and adequate hepatic, renal, hematologic, and cardiac function. Patients with previously treated stable, progressing, or untreated brain metastases (BMs) not requiring immediate local therapy were also eligible. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 21-day cycles of either tucatinib (300 mg orally twice a day [PO BID]) or placebo (PO BID), combined with T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1. Alpha-controlled secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 for the overall population, and PFS and OS for the subset of patients with BMs at baseline. Safety was analyzed as a secondary endpoint. Results: From October 8, 2019, to June 16, 2022, 463 patients were randomly assigned, comprising 228 to the tucatinib arm (tucatinib + T-DM1) and 235 to the control arm (placebo + T-DM1). The median duration of follow-up (OS) was 24.4 months for the overall population. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 arms. Almost half (44.1%) of the overall population had either active or stable BMs at baseline. As of the data cutoff (June 29, 2023), the study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the tucatinib arm vs control arm. The risk of progression or death decreased by 24.1% in the tucatinib arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.759 [95% CI, 0.607-0.950]; P=0.0163). Median PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.4-10.9) vs 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.6-8.1) for the tucatinib and control arms, respectively. HRs for PFS across all prespecified subgroups were consistent with the HR of the overall population, including patients with BMs at baseline (HR=0.639 [95% CI, 0.459-0.891]). The interim OS results were immature with 134 of 253 total required events (53%) and did not meet the prespecified crossing boundary. The confirmed ORR was numerically higher in the tucatinib arm (42.0%) vs the control arm (36.1%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included nausea (65.4% vs 49.4% for tucatinib and control arms, respectively), diarrhea (56.7% vs 26.6%), and fatigue (48.9% vs 37.3%). The most common grade ≥3 TEAEs in the tucatinib arm were alanine and aspartate aminotransferase elevations, each reported in 38 patients (16.5%) in the tucatinib arm and 6 patients (2.6%) in the control arm. TEAEs associated with any treatment discontinuation occurred in 51 patients (22.1%) in the tucatinib arm and 27 (11.6%) in the control arm. TEAEs leading to deaths occurred in 3 patients (1.3%) in the tucatinib arm and 2 patients (0.9%) in the control arm. Conclusion: HER2CLIMB-02 demonstrated that the addition of tucatinib to T-DM1 significantly improved median PFS in patients with previously treated HER2+ LA/MBC, including those with BMs. Although discontinuations due to TEAEs were more common in the tucatinib arm, no new safety signals emerged for the combination therapy.",

Pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab (H) and docetaxel (T) is the standard 1L dual anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive mBC. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of dual anti-HER2 regimen of Pyro+H+T (PyroHT) compared with placebo+H+T (HT) in untreated HER2-positive mBC. Methods: Eligible pts were randomized (1:1) to receive oral Pyro (400 mg QD) or placebo, both combined with intravenous H (8 mg/kg in cycle 1 and 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles) and T (75 mg/m2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was PFS per investigator (INV). Data cutoff for this prespecified interim analysis was May 25, 2022.\n Results: Between May 2019 and Jan 2022, 590 eligible pts from 40 centers were randomized and treated (297 with PyroHT and 293 with HT). Median follow-up was 15.8 mo and 14.9 mo, respectively. PFS per INV of PyroHT was significantly longer than HT (median, 24.3 mo [95% CI 19.1-33.0] vs 10.4 mo [95% CI 9.3-12.3]; HR, 0.41 [95% CI 0.32-0.53]; P < 0.0001; subgroup results are in the Table), which was consistent with PFS per IRC (median, 33.0 vs 10.4 mo; HR, 0.35 [95% CI 0.27-0.46]). The most common grade ≥3 TRAEs were decreased neutrophil count (62.6% vs 65.2%), decreased WBC count (53.2% vs 50.9%), and diarrhea (46.5% vs 3.1%). Grade 3 diarrhea occurred mainly during cycle 1 and substantially decreased in cycle 2 and thereafter. No grade 4 or 5 diarrheas occurred. Serious TRAEs occurred in 24.9% vs 6.1% of pts and treatment-related deaths occurred in 0 vs 0.3% of pts, respectively. Conclusion: PyroHT significantly prolonged PFS over HT in pts with HER2-positive mBC. The safety is manageable.

        "abstract": "Background: In the phase 3 KEYNOTE-355 trial (NCT02819518), pembrolizumab (pembro) combined with chemotherapy (chemo) showed statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS compared to placebo + chemo in patients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥10. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the CPS ≥1 population, and statistical significance was not tested in the ITT population due to the prespecified testing strategy. Here, we compare outcomes in subgroups of patients by additional CPS cut-offs to the primary results of KEYNOTE-355. Methods: 847 patients with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, ECOG PS 0-1, and ≥6 month disease-free interval were randomized 2:1 to pembro + chemo (nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days; paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days; or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days) or placebo + chemo for up to 35 administrations of pembro/placebo or until progression/intolerable toxicity. Patients were stratified by chemo type (taxane or gemcitabine-carboplatin), PD-L1 status (CPS ≥1 or <1), and prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment with same-class chemo (yes or no). Dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS (RECIST v1.1, blinded independent central review) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (CPS ≥10 and ≥1) and in the ITT population. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs in the additional CPS subgroups were based on an unstratified Cox model. Results: At the time of the final analysis (data cutoff, June 15, 2021), the median time from randomization to data cutoff was 44 months. Baseline characteristics of the CPS 1-9, 10-19, and ≥20 subgroups were generally similar to those of the ITT population. In the primary analyses, the HRs (95% CI) for OS were 0.73 (0.55-0.95) in the CPS ≥10 subgroup, 0.86 (0.72-1.04) in the CPS ≥1 subgroup, and 0.89 (0.76-1.05) in the ITT population; HRs (95% CI) for PFS were 0.66 (0.50-0.88), 0.75 (0.62-0.91), and 0.82 (0.70-0.98), respectively. Efficacy data are presented for the additional CPS subgroups in the Table. For OS, results in the CPS 1-9 subgroup showed comparable efficacy for pembro + chemo and placebo + chemo; however, results in the CPS 10-19 and CPS ≥20 subgroups showed a similar treatment benefit with the addition of pembro. Results for PFS were generally consistent with those observed for OS. Conclusion: These results provide support that CPS ≥10 is a reasonable cut-off to define the population of patients with metastatic TNBC expected to derive treatment benefit from pembro + chemo.",

        "abstract": "Background: TROP2 (trophoblast cell surface antigen 2) is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with worse survival. Sacituzumab tirumotecan (SKB264/MK-2870) is a TROP2 ADC developed with a novel linker to conjugate the payload, a belotecan-derivative topoisomerase I inhibitor with a drug-to-antibody-ratio (DAR) of 7.4. The hydrolytically linker permits both extracellular pH-sensitive cleavage and intracellular enzymatic cleavage to release the membrane permeable payload enabling the “bystander effect”. Here, we report the results from a phase Ⅲ study of sacituzumab tirumotecan in pts with advanced TNBC (OptiTROP-Breast01, NCT05347134). Methods: In this randomized phase Ⅲ trial, SKB264 was compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine) in pts with locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC who had received two or more prior therapies including at least one for metastatic setting. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR). The TROP2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the semi-quantitative H-score method. Results: Pts were randomly assigned to receive SKB264 (n = 130) or chemotherapy (n = 133). The median age was 51 years; 87% had visceral metastases; 26% received prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; 48% received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The primary endpoint of PFS was met based on interim analysis (data cutoff: Jun 21, 2023) with a 69% reduction in risk of progression or death (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.45; P <0.00001). The median PFS assessed by BICR was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.2) with SKB264 and 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.7) with chemotherapy; PFS at 6 months was 43.4% vs 11.1%. In the subset of pts with TROP2 H-score > 200, the median PFS was 5.8 months with SKB264 and 1.9 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.48). At the first planned interim analysis for overall survival (OS) (data cutoff: Nov 30, 2023) with median follow-up of 10.4 months, OS was statistically significant in favor of SKB264 (HR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.78; P =0.0005); the median OS was not reached (95% CI, 11.2 to NE) with SKB264 and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.5 to 11.7) with chemotherapy. The objective response rate assessed by BICR was 43.8% with SKB264 and 12.8% with chemotherapy. Most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (SKB264 vs chemotherapy) were neutrophil count decreased (32.3% vs 47.0%), anemia (27.7% vs 6.1%) and white blood cell count decreased (25.4% vs 36.4%).

        "abstract": "Background:  HER2+ breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) is an aggressive malignancy with high prevalence and limited treatment options. ZN-1041 is a best-in-class HER2 inhibitor designed to be delivered across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with high selectivity and broader safety margin to treat HER2+ BCBM. Methods: Brain penetration of ZN-1041 and other approved HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were evaluated. Anti-tumor activity of ZN-1041 alone or in combination were evaluated in xenograft models. ZN-A-1041-101 (NCT04487236) is an on-going phase 1, multicenter, open-label study. The study comprises first-in-human dose escalation of ZN-1041 monotherapy (phase 1a) in HER2+ solid tumor patients (pts) with or without BM, dose escalation (phase 1b) and expansion (phase 1c) of ZN-1041 in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in pts with HER2+ BCBM (including active BM). The primary objective was safety and tolerability. The secondary objective includes pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor response including ORR per RECIST 1.1 and intracranial ORR (iORR) per RANO-BM. Results: Unlike currently approved HER2 TKIs which are strong human efflux transporter P-gp and BCRP substrates, ZN-1041 is not a substrate of either and has high BBB permeability, therefore predicted to have good BBB penetration. ZN-1041 alone demonstrated dose-dependent and significant anti-tumor activity when compared to tucatinib in BM model. ZN-1041 could synergize with capecitabine and trastuzumab to demonstrate significantly improved intracranial efficacy in BM models, while maintaining good tolerability. In total, 21 HER2+ mBC pts were enrolled to complete phase 1a and 1b. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related SAE were observed across all dose levels. PK exposure was increased with dose escalation and Kpuu,CSF of ZN-1041 was 4.9. In ZN-1041 monotherapy, the overall ORR and iORR were 50% in TKI naïve, unequivocal HER2+ pts. The longest treatment duration was 15 months. As of data cutoff (Dec 02, 2022), totally 35 TKI naïve, HER2+ BCBM pts with median 2L treatments were enrolled for phase 1c and all pts were well tolerated to date. Adverse reactions of grade 3 or higher (≥5%) were hepatic function impairment (8.7%), headache (8.7%), hyperbilirubinemia (5.7%), ALT increased (5.7%), AST increased (5.7%), GGT increased (5.7%) and WBC decreased (5.7%). Among 19 BCBM pts with at least twice tumor assessment, the overall ORR was 78.9% (95% CI: 54.4–93.9) and iORR was 73.7% (95% CI: 48.8–90.9), DCR was 100%. In addition, 6 pts completed first tumor assessment and 5 achieved PR and 1 had SD per RECISIT 1.1. Conclusion: Encouraging efficacy and tolerability was observed for ZN-1041 monotherapy or combined with capecitabine and trastuzumab in TKI naïve, HER2+ BCBM patients. A Phase 2 pivotal trial for HER2+ BCBM with ZN-1041, capecitabine and trastuzumab combination therapy is planned.",

        "abstract": "Background: Utidelone, a genetically engineered epothilone analogue, has been proved to be efficacious for advanced breast cancer. However, the effect of utidelone for breast cancer patients(pts) with brain metastasis has not been reported. This trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of utidelone in combination with etoposide and bevacizumab in HER2-negative breast cancer pts with brain metastasis.\n Methods: HER2-negative breast cancer pts with brain metastasis were enrolled and Simon’s two-stage optimal trial design was used for this trial (NCT05781633). If more than 3 out of 13 pts show central nervous system (CNS) response, 30 more pts would be further enrolled. Utidelone (30mg/m2, iv, d1-5), and etoposide (100mg/m2, iv, d1-3) concurrently with bevacizumab (10mg/kg iv, d1) every 21 days for 6 cycles, with utidelone and bevacizumab maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was CNS–objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints include CNS-clinical benefit response (CBR), CNS-progression-free survival (PFS), ORR, PFS, CBR, overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: 17 female pts with a median age of 48 years (range 34-67) were enrolled from August 11, 2022 to March 22, 2023. 11 patients are evaluable for response with median cycles of 6 (2-8), all of whom are still under treatment. CNS-ORR, CNS-CBR, ORR, CBR were 73% (8/11), 82% (9/11), 27% (3/11) and 55% (6/11), respectively, including a pt with PR for 8 cycles. PFS and OS have not been reached due to a short follow-up time. Therefore, the trial has met the criteria to enter the second stage. The major adverse event (AE) was peripheral neuropathy (PN), primarily classified as sensory. Grade 3 PN was seen in 9% (1/11) of the total patients. Most of the treatment-related AEs were grade 1 or 2 and were considered manageable and reversible. 1 pt experienced utidelone-related dose adjustment. No treatment-related death occurred. Conclusion: Utidelone in combination with etoposide and bevacizumab has shown anti-tumor activity and manageable toxicity in breast cancer pts with brain metastasis, and a randomized control trial is warrantied.\n",

        "abstract": "Background: The primary treatment for brain metastases in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer is predominantly local therapies like radiotherapy, owing to the limited efficacy of systemic therapies. Prior research has demonstrated utidelone's significant permeability across the blood-brain barrier and the preliminary effectiveness of bevacizumab for breast cancer brain metastases. Consequently, this study investigated the efficacy and safety of utidelone combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced breast cancer brain metastases. Methods: This study was a single-arm, multi-center phase II clinical trial (NCT05357417). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with either radiotherapy-naive or progressive brain metastases post-radiotherapy, presented with asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastases associated with HER2-negative breast cancer.Patients received intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1 of each 3-week cycle) and utidelone (30 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 of each cycle) until intolerance or disease progression. The primary endpoint was central nervous system objective response rate (CNS-ORR), as assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1. Results: Between May 5, 2022, and October 25, 2023, a total of 46 patients were recruited, with a median age of 52.5 years (range, 33 to 69). Among them, 35 patients had untreated CNS lesions, while 11 had progressive brain metastases after local radiotherapy. The CNS-ORR was 43.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.9%-58.9%). As of January 8, 2024, the median duration of follow-up was 14.6 months, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.5-10.8) as shown in Table. The 12-month overall survival (OS) rate reached 74.4% (95% CI: 60.0%-92.3%). The most common grade 1-2 adverse events (AEs) were peripheral neuropathy (87.5%), decreased neutrophil count (62.5%), anemia (47.5%), diarrhea (37.5%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (25%). No grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs occurred. Conclusion: This study preliminarily shows promising efficacy and manageable safety of the combination of utidelone and bevacizumab in the treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases",

        "abstract": "Background: Brain metastases (BMs) in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) represent a significant unmet medical need. ESG401, a novel Trop2 ADC with SN38 conjugated to a humanized Trop2 mAb via a proprietary stable-cleavable linker at DAR8, is previously reported to have promising clinical efficacy against BC. ESG401 has been shown to suppress BMs in preclinical models, prompting to validation of its efficacy for BM in clinical trials.\n Methods: In the Phase Ia/b trial, HER2-negative mBC patients (pts) with treated/stable or new BM not requiring treatment at enrollment were eligible. Efficacy was assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria for both systemic and BM lesions. All HER2- brain metastatic pts within the study were included in this analysis, regardless of hormone receptor status or prior treatment lines. Results: A total of 134 HER2- mBC pts were enrolled, with 20 (15%) having BMs at baseline. As of Mar 20, 2024, 16 pts had efficacy-evaluable BMs, including 9 heavily pretreated TNBC (median prior lines of therapy: 5; range: 2–10), 5 HR+/HER2-BC (median prior lines of therapy: 4; range: 2–5) in the metastatic setting, and 2 first-line TNBC. The dosing regimens included 6 pts treated at 12 mg/kg, 4 pts at 14 mg/kg, and 6 pts at 16 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle, respectively. Among these 16 pts with BMs, two achieved a complete intracranial response (IC-CR), four had a partial intracranial response, and six had stable diseases as the best intracranial response. The detailed efficacy data are presented in the table. The longest duration of ESG401 treatment for one patient reached 17.7 months (still on treatment). The safety profile of ESG401 was similar in patients with and without BMs. Conclusion: ESG401 demonstrates encouraging therapeutic efficacy in both heavily pretreated and first-line HER2-negative mBC-BMs pts, with responses in brain metastatic and systemic lesions being consistent. These findings warrant further clinical evaluation.\n",

        "abstract": "Background: Based on the results of the CALGB 9343 trial, patients age ≥70 with T1N0 ER/PR+ HER2- breast cancer who are treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and endocrine therapy (ET) are candidates for omission of radiotherapy (RT). This trial predated the 21- gene RT-PCR recurrence score (RS) test, which is an assay now available for patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, node negative breast cancer to determine who will benefit from chemotherapy. Whether the RS can predict for patients most likely to benefit from radiation therapy (RT) following BCS has not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to use a large database of patients age ≥70 with T1N0 ER/PR+ HER2- disease to determine if RS could predict who would benefit from RT following BCS. Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried (2004-2017) for female patients age ≥70 with pT1N0 ER+ PR+ HER2- breast cancer treated with BCS and ET and who had an available RS. Patients were stratified based on their RS (low risk [LR] = 1-10, intermediate risk [IR] = 11-25, high risk [HR] = 26-99). For survival analysis, propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted overall and for each group to create 1:1 matched cohorts of patients who received radiotherapy and patients who did not. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank testing was used to evaluate overall survival (OS). Univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analysis were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models to determine which clinical and treatment factors were prognostic for OS. Results: A total of 13,614 patients met the selection criteria: 3,840 in the LR cohort, 8,383 in the IR cohort, and 1,391 in the HR cohort. A total of 79% received RT: 77% in the LR cohort, 79% in the IR cohort, and 85% in the HR cohort. Because PSM could not be efficiently performed in the HR cohort alone, the IR and HR cohort were merged (IRHR) for matching. After PSM, overall the 5-year OS was 90% for those who received RT and 88% for those who did not (p = 0.03). The 5-year OS in the LR cohort was 89% for those who received RT and 89% for those who did not (p = 0.517). In the IRHR cohort, the 5-year OS was 93% for those who received RT and 88% for those who did not (p = 0.004). On MVA in the overall cohort, RT (p = 0.037) was predictive of improved OS while increasing age (p < 0.001) and CDCC comorbidity score (p < 0.001) were predictive of worse OS. On MVA in the LR cohort, RT (p = 0.602) was not predictive of improved OS. However, on MVA in the IRHR cohort, RT (p = 0.004) was a positive prognostic factor for OS. Conclusion: This is the first study investigating the role of RS in this subset of patients eligible for omission of radiotherapy. There is an OS benefit with the use of RT in patients with IRHR RS, but not in patients with LR RS. Pending prospective evaluation, assessment of RS in this older subset of patients is recommended with consideration of RT when RS is ≥11.",
